There was one waitress who proceeded to ignore us for about 10 minutes. My sister finally went over to the register where the one waitress was chatting and placed our order for pastries. She was told the waitress would bring it over. 5 mins later, as we observed the waitress taking the order from a couple who came in AFTER us, my sister returned to the cashier to place our order. Waitress then claimed she thought the cashier would take care of us and pointed out that she had brought silverware over to the table. Wow! Unbelievable!

Le Pain Quotidien,5467,239 5th Ave,New York,11215.0,196317,"Well...  we found this place in Park Slope by accident. It looked nice from the outside, so we  decided to stop by for a breakfast.  We had no plans, had nowhere to run- hence truly appreciated this 'no rush' and  no pressure French service - that annoys the hell out of always  busy and overcommitted New Yorkers. Here is what you would not get in Le Pain Quotidien:1) Don't count on fitting your meal into one hour- save a couple of hours to be on a safe side2) just like in France - Forget about a 'snap on a finger' service or an immediate attention from a waiter that all of us, New Yorkers, take for granted Here is what you will get in return:1) breakfast served all day on Saturdays and Sundays2) the yummiest selection on the menu (make sure to try the Avocado Toast and Organic Coconut and Chia Seed Pudding (I liked it so much that I ordered to go)3) nobody will be standing on top of you with the check sending sublime messages that you have to clear your table ASAP- you are welcome to stay and take all the time that you want.We liked the food and their 'I have all day' attitude so much that we came back with a company of 10- and got a consistently similar experience: awesome food and off hands attitude from the waiter. That said, 'off hands' is not 'rude'. The staff is super friendly but you do need to chase them down to get what you want.(Hey, management- this is something worth of improving- just look at all of these pissed of reviews u are getting your patrons who are on a rush)So, manage your expectations -  and definitely check out the place if you have time.

I am a server so I have high standards but am also understanding and give people the benefit of the doubt because we all have bad days. But this location is the worst of the worst.

Le Pain Quotidien,5467,239 5th Ave,New York,11215.0,9665,"I am obsessed with this place! I have never heard or known about Le Pain Quotidien until I saw them open up in park slope. I yelped it and realized they are all over. Usually restaurants that have locations all over lack in the quality of food. Fortunately they do not! Everything is fresh, organic, and delicious! Trying to eat a little healthier is always hard because taste always falls flat. Le pain quotidien makes it easy. They eep everything simple, fresh and so yummy. I've had a few things here that I must share! First let's start with the pastry. The organic carrot cake is hands down best carrot cake I've ever had! You can tell the ingredients they use are organic if you're not used to eating a healthier carrot cake but it is to die! I also had their almond cheese danish, loved it! And their berry tart which was awesome as well! They have delicious drinks too! My favorite is this special drink they had. Which was a mix of fresh pressed watermelon, cucumber and lemon juice! Absolutely delicious! I could drink it all day. Unfortunately they have weekly specials and I believe the drinks change. Their set drinks keep me coming back too! I love their raspberry lemonade. Fresh muddled raspberries, and fresh squeezed lemonade. Very refreshing. The regular lemonade is delicious and the half lemonade half iced tea is good too. What's also so good is you can mix and match anything! I sometimes get half green tea half lemonade, yum! And keep in mind all their drinks are made with 100% pure agave nectar! Score!Now for the food! I've only tried three dishes but my god! These people know what they are doing! The first dish I had was a ""tartine"" which is a Belgian open faced sandwhich. Now this isn't no huge diner open faced sandwhich piled with meat and toppings thats going to put you to sleep. It's a very well proportioned sandwhich that keeps you feeling full!My fist tartine was the omega-3. Avocado, chickpeas, cucumbers, spicy tahini, and a mix of flax seeds, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds served on wheat bread. I couldn't get enough! Soo good! And of it may look a little small, fear not. It is very filling! I eat a lot and I was stuffed with some still on my plate!I also had the rustic tuna, caramelized onions, cucumbers, and a type of French Dijon sauce. Also amazing! And lastly I've tried the Mediterranean platter. It comes with hummus, babaganoush and quinoa tabule, and assorted breads. Best hummus I've ever had! I can't believe it!!!! Seems like every time I come here and order something new it just gets better and better. I'm so happy they opend up le pain quotidien! I feel my park slope people are unaware of this new spot and think its still the old French restaurant ""moutarde"". It's not people!! wake up and go have some goods at Le Pain Quotidien!

Le Pain Quotidien is a cute restaurant that truly believes in simple eating. They have several options on their menu, including seasonal options and they are all delicious! My dining experience started at the front door. The look of this place is very classic and rustic. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu, which gave me peace of mind because the last thing you want is to be served by someone who knows nothing about the food or mission of the restaurant they work for. I digress. The food.The food was...AMAZING!!!I had the skillet baked eggs made with smoked salmon and dill and two organic eggs. It's also  served with their organic freshly baked bread. They also have a gluten free option. I practically inhaled that meal. It was so simple, but the ingredients were fresh and the execution of the meal elevated all of the ingredients. The only complaint I had was that I wish there was more, but that is a testament to my own selfish desires. Nothing but good things to say about this place.I also ordered the chia latte, which is sweetened with raw organic agave nectar. If you want something to warm your belly that isn't aggressively sweet, this is definitely for you!To finish off my meal I ordered the cafe' gourmand. You are given the choice of coffee or cappuccino with selection of three mini pastries. I naturally chose coffee and chose three mini desserts. I blinked twice and my plate was empty. The chocolate tart was the richest out of the three, but the coffee was the perfect pairing for it. None of the desserts were overwhelming and they were just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Le Pain Quotidien,5467,239 5th Ave,New York,11215.0,177314,"In the morning, this place is just OK.  Nothing special.  It does the job for an ice coffee and a nice chat with friends.  The reason why I even bothered writing this was because I have experienced HORRIBLE service from the afternoon girl at the register (long curly hair, brown plastic glasses, slightly on the larger side).  She works around 2:30/3:00.  Weeks ago, she was rude, rolling her eyes at me, huffing and puffing, slamming the ice coffee back on the counter when I kindly asked for more milk...so bizarre. The order was for just one simple ice coffee with milk. I brushed it off and assumed MAYBE she was having a bad day.  This week, she just went all out rude and honestly disgusting.  She was being so nasty to her co-worker/waiter.  In clear view and hearing range of me, she snapped at her co-worker over a very simple request.  Told him to get whatever he needed for himself.  Then, minutes later, she was pouring/tossing/sloshing water from a clear pitcher all over the entryway floor...literally just throwing the water from about 3 ft high in 4 or 5 puddles.  She mopped it around. Then, without washing her hands, went to behind the counter, poured a drink order, and then went back to mopping.  She kept wiping her face with her apron.  The pitcher that she used for the water went back behind the counter near the sink.  Then, she continued to mop with in millimeters of this little girl's feet.  Everyone at the little tables near us, were staring in disbelief.  In addition, the takeaway yogurt parfaits that afternoon were about 1/3 full.

The music was perfectly selected as a calming and somewhat energetic background, set at the perfect volume.

She is the only reason why this is a two star rating, instead of one.Honestly, though. One good manager and a few good servers does not make up for a generally disorganized and inattentive staff. I hope Joanna gets out of there soon, her talents are being wasted on such a poorly run place.

I really wanted to rate this place higher because it has a lovely vibe and the staff is super warm. Their pastries are wonderful and the extensive crepe menu looks incredible, but I have one big gripe: the coffee. Every time I've ordered a basic cup of drip from here has resulted in super weak, watery coffee. I gave them a few tries because I realize everyone has their bad days, but this has been a consistent problem since I started coming here. Their espresso drinks are tasty, but unaffordable for an almost-daily caffeine fix.

The cuisine is a mixture of French & Senegalese, which I am a big fan of (another spot to try is Cafe Rue Dix in Crown Heights !) and their menu is extensive, especially for a small cafe. Minus one star ONLY because they were out of bread for sandwiches but that's totally forgivable given how amazing the service was. I got the ginger drink and my bf got the bissap drink. Both were sooooo delicious and refreshing. He also had a crepe with brie, ham & mushrooms and I had a bite and it was truly melt in your mouth amazing. The atmosphere is low key, and they play great music (but not too loud). The service was excellent, everyone working there was kind and attentive.

We then had the 5 piece charcuterie. 2 cheeses Roquefort and Camembert. We also had pate,salmon and saucisson herb de Provence. They served them with a French baguette and sweet spreads.

I intend to come back for a proper dinner soon as I really liked the this place overall. We found Le Pif in yelp while looking for a nearby wine bar, and thought it was worth a visit. I am a big fan of French wine and the ambiance seemed rather chill. To no one's surprise the dining room is dimly lit, with a nice mix of chill music and an attentive yet relaxed staff. The wine   list is rather large and you can taste anything on the menu. I had a number of wines from at least three different regions of France, of which there is a map on the wall so you can track.Not much else I can say here, other than if you are looking for some good french wine and a chill atmosphere, Le PIf will not disappoint.

I got here for brunch, and as a party of 2, I waited for my friend. There were many many seats available, but he didn't sit me. Immediately after me, a party of 4 came in and they were seated right away. When I asked the owner why I wasn't seated, when there are seats available, he explained to me that they have a policy of waiting until the whole party arrives, for example, if he had given me a seat then he would have lost the table he just sat. But there were an additional 10 opens seats as we were talking.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,3527,"I don't get how this place has four stars. The hubby and I went for brunch with friends there. Basically because we'd get ""unlimited"" drinks.Now for the good. Everyone ordered the beef sandwich and I opted for the chicken since it has a lot of my favorite things. Grilled onions, cheese and grilled chicken. Along with frites. The food was fine. It wasn't anything I'd rave about but it wasn't anything that was terrible either. All in all, average. Three starsThen we take one away for service. Or lack thereof. Unlimited drinks are nice. But it's not really unlimited if no one pays attention to you to give you refills and you have to spend a long time trying to get someone's attention. Especially when these drinks are completely watered down. How watered down are they? Well, I refuse to drink and drive (because Brooklyn drivers be nuts!) but ended up driving after a short walk around the park with my companions but definitely could have driven immediately after. I may as well have drank water. Speaking of, they didn't refill that either.Add to that, the rude service we received by the French waiter. I don't think he could have been more stereotypical in his French rudeness. He wasn't the least bit friendly taking our orders. Then we never saw him again. We saw the runners when we were able to flag them down for refills twice. We did see him again as he tried to sell us on dessert and then again, after he basically kicked us out after paying the bill. He said that other people are waiting for the table... and now that would be fine... if there were actually other people waiting for the table. I was looking as we were wrapping up because I hate when I'm the one waiting for a table as people sit there and talk for an hour more. And I'm ok with that. But apparently there were ghosts and invisible people there waiting for a table to eat and I just couldn't see them.Also, despite all four of us pretty much getting the same thing, we found the salad and frites portions to be quite disproportionate from plate to plate. I mean, to the point where we actually noticed this and found it quite odd that they'd add substantially more to one plate of one thing vs. far less to another. Yeah, you don't expect it to be exactly even from plate to plate but you don't expect it to be that glaringly obvious either.And here's what gets Le P'tit Paris Bistro to one star. My husband had the $10 prix fix brunch since he wasn't going to drink. They charged him for the mimosa meal. It was only after we left that we'd realized that we'd been overcharged by $6. By then it was hours later and it was too late to go back. Sad face.After the rude and crappy service, coupled with average food, I just can't justify going back and giving this place a second chance. It's a shame because I've walked by here and wanted to go for brunch *AND* for dinner. It's a cute place and I really wanted to love it, or at the very least like it, because who doesn't love having a cute French place nearby?

Last week i made a reservation for 8 people for today at 2 pm, for my family and my fiance's family to meet( so this reservation was kind of a big deal to us). I received a call from the restaurant this morning, the day we are supposed to go there, at 11 am asking if we could change the reservation to 1 pm because there is a party at 3 pm and the party just called to increase the number of guests and we would only have an hour to eat. Worth mentioning, when i initially called to make the reservation I asked for a 1 pm reservation but i was told they had a morning party as well so they would be able to accommodate us at 2 pm.  I told the guy who called that I had people coming from Queens and SI so I wouldn't be able to change it to 1 pm. So the guy asked if we could change the day of our brunch until tomorrow, ummm nooooo we can't this is clearly a special occassion. I was nervous enough to begin with because our families are meeting and now this!!!! Clearly reservations don't mean anything at this restaurant.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,18668,"Interesting brunch at Le P'tit Paris today with my boyfriend. The prices of the brunch were too awesome to turn down, so after a quick stroll around the neighborhood looking for a late lunch, we decided to come here.The waitstaff were extremely friendly and attentive, and quickly brought us our tea and coffee to drink while we waited for our meals - an eggs benedict and french toast.We chatted, drank our warm drinks, looked outside the many windows of the restaurant, people finished their food and left, and new people came in... and then THEIR food came.Did they forget our order? Yes. So after they realized that, they had to put in our orders AGAIN, which they rushed and made poorly, because my eggs benedict was definitely sub par - the english muffins were burned, home fries were also burned, and I had a teeny tiny measly piece of canadian bacon on each muffin. However, the eggs themselves were great. Overall, not too much flavor. But then again, it was the eggs benedict, home fries, bacon, and unlimited tea for $10... so how mad could I be? ... and my boyfriend's french toast was awesome.They were so apologetic about having to re-put in our order and for our delay, that the server gave us each a dessert on the house :DOne way to win this girl's heart is through dessert, so kudos! I ordered cream puffs filled with custard, and my boyfriend ordered the napoleon.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,16327,"most of the reviews rave about the brunch so gave that a shot,$10 with unlimited coffee, tea or juice and $16 to include unlimited mimosas, house wine, or bloody mary's sounded good. In summary I think it's only loved  by people because it's a good deal overall.once we got there the place was a bit tight for a stroller but they were very friendly and accomodizing.i asked what was good, he recommended the pancakes (which i was debating anyway) - asked if i wanted fruit, i said no...pancakes came with fruit anyways. Apples and pineapples (weird combination of fruit i must say). Not just that, it wasn't exactly pancakes, but one thick pancake. Almost the consistency of a waffle.It was edible.The Mimosa was ok, but it was made with an artificial orange drink, not real orange juice (at lost not a good one). Wife's house wine was awful, but the third glass was a different bottle and drinkable.Her steak sandwich was considerably better than my food. Fries were absolutely awesome (but i expect that from a place that has the word bistro in the name).Now here's the real problem...the place has two massive air conditioners and a fan, but the most troubling part of my experience wasn't the slow service, or them taking their time refilling the unlimited drinks (yes, i get it, you don't want to lose too much money)... but I was pretty much uncomfortably soaked half way through the meal (with the AC and the fan on!).Maybe they were on the fritz cause we've had quite a heat spell recently. But it definitely docks a star, just made it a very uncomfortable experience.Also - not exactly sure what it is with the Eiffel Tower obsession, by the way. Every picture in there seems to be of the Eiffel Tower. Ok, you have Paris in the name, stop trying so hard. There are much prettier things in Paris other than the Eiffel Tower.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,92135,"I should've tried the eggs benedict! I heard they were good. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered 3 eggs over easy. The eggs come with bacon and home fries. Let me tell you, no bueno. My eggs were pretty much cooked through. Not at all runny. The bacon was way too fried and if you poked your fork on it, it crumbled to bits. The home fries were dry and hard to eat without ketchup or some kind of sauce. I did try some of the goat cheese salad and it was a little better. The goat cheese came in two giant balls and it was very creamy, fresh cheese. Tasted well with the greens. But other than that, the salad was pretty bland and lacked dressing. The onion soup was also okay. I had a spoonful from my friend. This is not part of the brunch set so it costed extra. People who ordered the eggs benedict enjoyed it so maybe that is the way to go. Price for brunch is very decent.

The proprietor's suggestions for wine were good and actually pointed out the cheaper wines on the list. All of the food we had was exceptionally good, with the exception of the moule frites. It was a large portion, however the broth was very lightly seasoned, and tasted like mussel water. The duck mousse is best enjoyed with the addition of some mustard to give it some acidic tang in my opinion.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,196953,"We were here tonight for dinner as part of Dine Brooklyn, and were exceptionally pleased with the restaurant.  I suggested it to friends because it was the closest restaurant with great Yelp reviews, and everyone agreed that it looked like a great option.  When we arrived, as a party of six (including two kids), we were seated immediately, and handed menus that said ""2 for $30"".  I thought that was wrong, because the Dine Brooklyn restaurants were supposed to offer three courses for $25.  Then my husband and friends explained that meant two people for $30: a deal that normally was only offered Sunday-Thursday.  That said, I wondered how good the food could be at those prices.  But each dish surpassed expectations, and everything was actually really good, in a very simple, classic way.  The appetizer options were for salad, soup of the day, or duck mousse. The main courses were for tilapia in tomato sauce, pork casserole, or ricotta ravioli in lemon sauce.  The desserts were a floating island or strawberries in Chantilly cream.  It's a menu that can also be seen on the restaurant's website (leptitparisbistro.com/ho…).  I saw so many ways for this to go wrong, and since I had picked the restaurant as a top suggestion, I was a little concerned that it was going to be an evening of bottom shelf ingredients, poorly made with a minimum of effort or skill, and served in small portions, to boot.  What we got was three courses of simple, classic French-style food, made with quality, real food ingredients, served in generous portions.  Everyone greatly enjoyed dinner, and did so at such reasonable prices that I had to check to be sure we were still in the NYC city limits.The two women at the table had appetizers of duck mousse with toast and cornichons, while the guys both had gazpacho.  The duck mousse was a hefty slice of creamy, finely textured, delicious duck pate.  My son immediately ate my cornichons, and the waiter kindly brought extra so I could experience the contrast of the sour cornichons with the rich, slightly gamey pate.  The gazpacho was light, perfectly balanced, and clearly made with fresh tomatoes.  It had a spicy bite to it, and was drizzled with fresh olive oil.  The kids meals were served at a perfect time: just before the parent main courses, so we could get our kids eating while waiting, rather than letting food get cold like we usually do.   The tilapia entree came out crispy, with a light tomato sauce, served over a generous heap of julienned zucchini and carrots and well-made mashed potatoes.  It was a delightful surprise, since the description of ""tilapia in tomato sauce"" made me think it was going to be fish sauteed in something more like pasta sauce than crispy fish with a light tomato broth.  The pork casserole, which I did not try, came over the same mashed potatoes.  The kids entrees were extremely simple, but well executed - my son's thin fries disappeared between him and his friend, and we had to get a second order for the kids to share.  His medium-well burger looked like it had been overdone, but when I cut into it, it was still juicy in the middle, without any pinkness (as appropriate for a four year old)Finally, we had to choose dessert.  I chose a floating island, which came out as a huge rectangle of perfectly textured meringue, atop a fresh citrus cream base, drizzled with a tart raspberry sauce.  It was absolutely amazing, and I could have finished the whole thing (but I managed to hand part of it to my husband to try).  I've never had a floating island before, since it's sort of a classic dessert, and isn't in vogue anymore, but this was so well executed, and so delicious, I wish it hadn't gone out of style.Throughout the meal, we had little carafes of red wine.  We each had about a glass and a half worth of wine over the course of the evening.  So after three courses for four people, two kids' meals, and three small carafes of house wine, it was a surprise when, at the end of the night, the bill was for only $112, including tax.  I checked, and everything was on it: everyone's meals, wine, and the kids' extra fries.  Amazing.  If you're in the South Slope, I seriously recommend checking this place out, instead of the high-rent restaurants along 7th Ave.  This is a great, down to earth restaurant that I would be happy to go back to - especially on a Sunday through Thursday.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",5,0,0.40000000596,18.6000003815,"restaurant,menu,deal,surprise,restaurant,menus,part,dinner,husband,tilapia,restaurants,duck mousse,courses,everyone,friends,Dine Brooklyn,friends,party,pork casserole,option,people,reviews,kids,surprise,prices,Dine Brooklyn,everything,island,food,Yelp,restaurant,tomato sauce,lemon sauce,Everyone,earth restaurant,duck mousse,island,food,son,prices,pork casserole,Chantilly cream,expectations,courses,burger,restaurant,dish,way,soup,salad,ricotta ravioli,strawberries,website,kids,tomatoes,courses,tomato sauce,pasta sauce,tomato sauce,gazpacho,food,kids meals,fish,cornichons,cornichons,cornichons,cold,tilapia entree,contrast,portions,shelf ingredients,portions,food ingredients,gazpacho,appetizers,duck pate,son,pate,dinner,guys,island,crispy,mashed potatoes,fish,mashed potatoes,course,courses,suggestion,minimum,ways,effort,skill,quality,toast,table,women,city,bite,olive oil,courses,description,red wine,meal,wine,carrots,zucchini,heap,something,tomato broth,dessert,desserts,everything,carafes,people,part,kids,kids,restaurants,appetizer options,thing,vogue,half,glass,fries,everyone,waiter,meals,house wine,wine,French,NYC,bill,meals,carafes,kids,raspberry sauce,dessert,fries,friend,place,order,pinkness,middle,rectangle,meringue,citrus cream base,South Slope,7th Ave,tax,kids entrees","2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,1,1,1,1,3,7,7,1,5,1,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,1,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,1,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,1,7,6,6,2,2,5,7,7,1,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7","0.204934448004,0.0503893196583,0.0411623120308,0.0365588255227,0.0319714620709,0.0258868839592,0.0254902914166,0.0231997165829,0.0219369865954,0.0195579696447,0.0187529176474,0.0167752858251,0.0144830970094,0.0138892568648,0.0138892568648,0.0137706063688,0.0137294232845,0.0120949689299,0.0118428189307,0.011060308665,0.0109329130501,0.00967984553427,0.00893133413047,0.0077733611688,0.0070905466564,0.00649714795873,0.00624014809728,0.00615486456081,0.00603908905759,0.00573529396206,0.00571277737617,0.00548092322424,0.00548092322424,0.00492456741631,0.00458888988942,0.00456510856748,0.00455221999437,0.0043913172558,0.00428893091157,0.00416748272255,0.00414612516761,0.00414059357718,0.00402749795467,0.00392435537651,0.00389589834958,0.00385299162008,0.00363918649964,0.00363918649964,0.00363303278573,0.00363303278573,0.0036276136525,0.00362277287059,0.00361839914694,0.00350541691296,0.00348908244632,0.00335450726561,0.00335232703947,0.00335025438108,0.00335025438108,0.00331567926332,0.00329680950381,0.00328098936006,0.00310373259708,0.00306018069386,0.00305500510149,0.00305500510149,0.00286034517922,0.00280613964424,0.00279481615871,0.00278879143298,0.00278879143298,0.00278596300632,0.00278596300632,0.00278334668837,0.00278334668837,0.00278091337532,0.00277863885276,0.00277863885276,0.00274828332476,0.00259449565783,0.00256985542364,0.00253548822366,0.00253548822366,0.0025339203421,0.00253242626786,0.00249382760376,0.00249271839857,0.00243989168666,0.00243989168666,0.00243989168666,0.00243989168666,0.00243989168666,0.00243741692975,0.00243512773886,0.00243512773886,0.00243512773886,0.00243512773886,0.00242738076486,0.00242738076486,0.00237456546165,0.00233222055249,0.0022330279462,0.0022330279462,0.00223199860193,0.00221825577319,0.00221825577319,0.00221825577319,0.00221688393503,0.00221688393503,0.00207464909181,0.00197187345475,0.00195800652727,0.00188691471703,0.00188520562369,0.00180539605208,0.00180339673534,0.00180262152571,0.00180114677642,0.00179851590656,0.00165157648735,0.00165078614373,0.00165002502035,0.00165002502035,0.00163948966656,0.00163948966656,0.00162015715614,0.00154449313413,0.00154449313413,0.00154382921755,0.00144277350046,0.00144141807687,0.00136356672738,0.00135993375443,0.00130505557172,0.00114570977166,0.00109519122634,0.00104751053732,0.00104200618807,0.00104200618807,0.00100444606505,0.000934742158279,0.000724889629055,0.000724889629055,0.000724514364265,0.000724514364265,0.000724514364265,0.000674851646181,0.000674851646181,0.000670150329825,0.000358875055099"

My go-to steak frites place in Park Slope closed awhile back and I had a craving so we went Friday night.The ambiance is fine for what it is - a pleasant but unfancy neighborhood place. My GF's housemade pate was fine, my mesclun salad, w. walnuts, blue cheese, and beets, was pleasant without being exciting.The steak frites, OTOH, was perfect. A truly generous portion of hanger steak, tender and perfectly cooked to the medium rare we requested. Good fries too. At $17 this was a ridiculous bargain. The only caveat is that some people might find it a bit salty. To us it was fine.Service was extremely attentive and friendly. I assume the combination of good service, gentle prices, and pleasing food explained the full house.Windsor Terrace is adjacent to Park Slope but a different world. While we were having our pre dinner martinis at a PS bar/restaurant we were plagued by a group of devil children, shrieking and running around. The moms clearly looked overmatched.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,196645,"Apparently, this restaurant does not want return business, because the food was disgusting. It serves what is to French cuisine what my mother's enchiladas (Corn tortillas, campbell's tomato soup, ground beef, and velveeta cheese) is to authentic Mexican food.They served me a nasty fish soup (I shudder to think what they made it with, perhaps the dishwater?), and the lamb shank on fetticuine. They couldn't even spring for real fetticuni, and instead served the rubbery lamb on egg noodles from Key Food. There was no spice.My friend ordered the trout. It came with plain white rice and the fish had clearly been boiled. He asked how it had been cooked, and the scam artist cum maitre'd claimed it had been pan seared with olive oil. I doubt that it was trout. My friend is a sweetheart, so he spiced it the best he could with 3 lemon wedges, which the waiter grudgingly gave him, and lots of salt and pepper.

The restaurant is very nicely decorated, the owners wait on you and take obvious pride in what they have built, and the food is quite good. Not a bad combination in my book!We both had the hanger steak and understood why it is one of their most popular dishes. For $17 it comes with salad and fries. The steak was tender and flavorful and the fries and salad, while nothing special, were quite good.Now as any French restaurant worth it's name, Le P'tit Paris Bistro serves fresh bread and rich desserts.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,131242,"Until tonight, I had no idea this place was here, and I live like two streets away. I kind of thought the entire space had just shut down after Regina Bakery closed. Tonight my parents and I decided to try it after we'd gotten back from Manhattan and didn't want to travel too much further for dinner. P'tit Paris is definitely apropos- there's only a little bit of Paris to be found in this place. (And to a previous reviewer, yes, ""p'tit"" is a correct usage, it's the French equivalent of saying ""li'l"" instead of ""little."") It wasn't crowded at all, but that could have been due to the lateness of the hour (it was almost ten) or hell, just the fact that Windsor Terrace is still kind of a wasteland. Our waiter was very friendly, although not entirely too thorough (I overheard another waiter telling someone else the specials later and I was like, ""Hey, OUR guy didn't tell us about the pumpkin soup...""). We all ended up having the hanger steak. And you know, it was quite good. I like mine medium-well, and it cut really nicely, even with me forgetting I was given a steak knife until I was like a quarter of the way through it. It came with a handful of greens that had a really good mustard-y vinaigrette on them, and a ton of fries, which I wasn't as crazy about. (Particularly because they put ketchup down for the fries. If you actually go to Paris, there is no ketchup to be found anywhere. I'm just saying. I ended up soaking my fries in steak juice and eating them with my fork. Don't hate.) Even though the whole portion was really modestly sized, all of us were full afterwards. I was a *little* curious about dessert, but I hate eating dessert when no one else is like I'm seven, so I passed. Next time. However, when the waiter (a different waiter than the one who'd initially been serving us- like I said, not entirely too thorough) brought us our check, he also mentioned that there was ""no such thing as no dessert,"" and brought out some homemade chocolate- which was freaking great. Very, very rich, and covered in powdered cocoa, but definitely dessert enough. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised- a nice restaurant, like an actual nice restaurant, in Windsor Terrace.

We were given a $100 gift certificate which was purchased in early June, it expired late August!  We had many times been to the restaurant but forgot to bring the certificate with us.  When we finally remembered the other night, we were sadly told by one of the owners that there was nothing he could do--and this was said to us, regular customers.  He finally relented somewhat and gave us partial credit for the gift certificate.I find this to be extremely bad neighborhood relations and bad business on their part.  They received the money and refused to honor the full value of the certificate within months of purchase.  So, if you do purchase a gift certificate from them, make sure you know what your are getting and make sure the person you gift it to also is aware or you will be throwing your money away.  I'm sure the person who purchased it for us didn't realize is expired so quickly.  I feel as though it is a real rip-off and as a result, I have decided not to patronize their establishment any more.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.40000000596,7.69999980927,"food,family,neighborhood restaurant,regulars,service,gift certificate,experience,one,nothing,rip-off,restaurant,gift certificate,times,PATRONS,PURCHASE GIFT CERTIFICATES,certificate,gift,restaurant,person,neighborhood relations,owners,customers,business,credit,WHO,person,money,certificate,gift certificate,result,establishment,money,purchase,part,value","7,1,2,1,7,7,7,1,7,4,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,1,1,7,7,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.338220000267,0.108318969607,0.0868134200573,0.0562034137547,0.05234939605,0.0419899858534,0.0333496518433,0.0313143245876,0.0239119678736,0.0233267042786,0.0198087152094,0.0135179730132,0.013441471383,0.0127294054255,0.0119034778327,0.0115560824051,0.0111586907879,0.0107087595388,0.00976661127061,0.00951909925789,0.00850883219391,0.00778737524524,0.00777422310784,0.00777422310784,0.00754447467625,0.00705382833257,0.00662108091637,0.00401967251673,0.00401430856436,0.00400282861665,0.00400282861665,0.00298412842676,0.00290941703133,0.00254922523163,0.00254542101175"

It wasn't terrible but not a great dish. I just don't feel beef should be partnered with noodles.Other dishes were good at our table. The salmon tasted fresh and fantastic.The service did not help our dining experience. Our french waiter, whom I spoke to in French, felt so rushed that night. Our entrees took a while to arrive a the table and when they did things were disorganized. I did not receive the  mussels that I ordered. I was supposed to get he ones with seafood broth. Instead I received the tomato sauce which I didn't noticed until I started eating and getting towards the bottom. Overall we both didn't get the ideal dishes we wanted.

The restaurant was pretty full and there were a lot of tables despite the size of the restaurant (it isn't too big) but it does have a small bar. Against my better judgment, I ended up doing the $16 unlimited alcoholic brunch versus the $10 unlimited coffee/juice/tea option. With my mimosa, I ended up ordering the eggs benedict, which came with a side of bacon (4 strips) and potatoes. My date ordered his sake bloody mary with french toast which came with a side of fruit. Both were delicious but its only the egg dishes that come with potatoes and bacon. If you're definitely wanting more food, I would order the eggs benedict. The french toast was very yummy and sweet (even before dipping it in syrup) but it came in small individual pieces of bread.

The menu choices are comprehensive, the décor is passable (exposed brick wall is a direct contribution to this) and the waiters are super helpful. Last time I came here was with a big group and we were promptly seated and served. We ordered a range of dishes, but the ones I tried include: Brie sur toast - it's a very fresh and appetizing brie cheese salad with apple confits. Absolutely recommend ordering thisMussels in a spicy broth - the broth was delicious and I generally love mussels but this dish was disappointing since many of the mussels were still rawFilet de sole - the lemon butter sauce on my flounder was overbearing (too much lemon ) and the accompanying julienne vegetables were just okayFrench fries (clearly we had kids at the table) - exactly how I love them - stringy but not oilyOverall, I had a good experience and was absolutely charmed by the French waiters (it's not often that the staff actually speaks French!).

The service was a tad slow especially since we had kids with us. They didn't even bring us bread until we had to ask for it after our fries came out. We ordered the mussels in white wine garlic broth and it was ok. The broth was really watery, not at all broth like but at least it had a nice flavor to it. I've definitely had better version of this dish elsewhere. The mussels were small but fresh since they were all open and not a single one was close or partially closed. No fishy taste either. My friend had the seafood pasta which was not good at all. The pasta was too soggy. Most of the seafood was overcooked. The shrimp and clams were borderline rubbery.My other friend ordered the penne chicken alfredo (yes, it's not a french dish but she ordered it to share with her daughter.) She thought it was ok as well. Nothing to brag about but at least the pasta was not soggy.Overall, a 3-star experience. Service was slow and our waiter was not attentive even though it was not busy.

I was thinking in my head because I don't have that much experience eating french made food. But this couldn't be right.... I called the waiter and told him, does this look undercook to you?.. He said yes. He took the plate back and the kitchen re-fired my shrimps.... I found that quiet strange-serving someone a pasta dish with raw shrimp?.....Anyhooo, they gave me back my plate, the shrimp looked cooked but it did not taste like shrimp at all.... Soooo bizarre. I was kind of disturbed at this point but managed to eat the pasta which was al right, and forced my self to eat 3 pieces of the shrimp and gave the rest to my husband which he didn't mind them but he also thought they didn't taste like shrimp.....Totally not the waiter's fault, I thought he was very nice, but I can't give the kitchen a good rating because the food wasn't great at all... My husband's hanger steak was not that great either from what he said.... But we were hungry and tired and didn't want to make a big deal out of it...

This little ""Parisian "" bistro (and by Parisian,  I mean they have pictures of Paris on the walls and French magazines in the bathroom but that's about as Parisian as it gets) is  easily located in the heart of Prospect park west. We used a restaurant.com certificate which they we're very happy to redeem toward the 16.99 pre fixe brunch menu that included your choice of unlimited mimosas, sangria or house wine. Upon entering we noticed the place was HOT! Not just hot, but like Congo Africa  HOT. The host told us the AC was broken, which we understood, but they had not a single door or window open, specially since the place has glass patio or ""French"" doors if you will. Nevertheless,  we will carry on for the unlimited booze.  Our server took our orders and  brought a carafe of water which was, you guessed it...HOT (no ice and room temperature... puke!) By now, I'm pretty disgusted, but the wine is flowing and I'm starting not too care so much until, the French onion soup I ordered came out... absolutely freaking disgusting.  Picture a bowl of murky hot sewer water with some onions thrown in and a piece of soggy white bread with a glop of melted cheese in top and... voila!By this time, I'm  beginning to lose all hope and then my croque Monsieur comes out and takes every last bit with it.  Nothing special about this sand which, dry white bread,  deli Ham, and some kind of hard dry cheese melted on top. I had to ask for mustard just to choke it down...complete disappointment. My husband wasn't too impressed with his chicken sandwich either, but he did say the avacado salad was pretty good.The only thing that redeems this place from getting one star is the creme brulee is absolutely FANTASTIC.

My french toast came and my mouth was exploding!  My french toast was a delightful combination of raspberry sauce, maple syrup and a light dusting of powdered sugar along with apples, pineapple and raspberry.  It was a little bit of french toast heaven in every little bite! (I say little as this meal was actually served as little tiny pieces of french toast, but don't let the portion fool you!  However if you have a larger appetite, this may not be the right portion for you..)My girlfriends were loving their meals however they both agreed that there was just too much ham.  The ham itself was nice, however it was just too much.  The onion soup apparently hit the spot on that cold afternoon (yes, I know, it's May) and was delicious as well.  Throughout our meal, my girlfriends switched from Team Mimosas to Team Red Sangrias.  I had a sip and it was not Finlay approved however they both liked them.  I, of course, stuck with the Finlay approved Mimosas.  We enjoyed the drinks so much, we ordered desert: creme brulee.  The creme brulee was like eating the Katy Perry ""Hot N Cold"" song.Overall, the service was outstanding, the food delicious and the drinks were a flowin' without any feeling of being rushed or being told your bottomless drinks were finished.  I told my boyfriend that we should come here but honestly, I don't mind who I come with because what I do know is that I definitely want to come back here again!",4.0 star rating,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,11.5,"friends,Le P'tit Paris Bistro,Brooklyn,conclusion,friend,one,One,brunch,french toast,restaurants,girlfriends,motivation,bit,place,onion soup,french toast,mimosas,ham,menu,food,coffee,juice,teas,taste,selection,cheese crepe,french toast,ham,portion,meal,drinks,ham,brunch,onion,meals,raspberry,portion,pineapple,apples,sugar,dusting,maple syrup,raspberry sauce,french toast heaven,bite,pieces,creme brulee,appetite,spot,Team Mimosas,service,creme brulee,food,Finlay,mouth,course,desert,mimosas,drinks,feeling,Katy Perry,Hot N Cold,meal,boyfriend,Team Red Sangrias,sip","1,3,2,7,1,1,7,4,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,5,7,1,3,7","0.318366855383,0.0962196290493,0.0879970788956,0.0661996304989,0.0393754690886,0.0373305790126,0.033785354346,0.0301918964833,0.02795686014,0.0248523037881,0.0206189118326,0.0150895640254,0.0140572711825,0.00833839923143,0.00699466234073,0.00688671506941,0.00654305517673,0.00602693483233,0.00574879115447,0.00550265330821,0.004840049427,0.004840049427,0.004840049427,0.00481526879594,0.00481526879594,0.00479776319116,0.00461140507832,0.00439671892673,0.00410744827241,0.00403513805941,0.00396108953282,0.00392834888771,0.00370278418995,0.00370278418995,0.00368728325702,0.00368381617591,0.00367041677237,0.00322328670882,0.00322328670882,0.00322328670882,0.00322328670882,0.00322328670882,0.00322328670882,0.00321699795313,0.00321699795313,0.00321155996062,0.0029707713984,0.00293460302055,0.00292715057731,0.00274304160848,0.00259927147999,0.00248985714279,0.00248782127164,0.00246724090539,0.00235350895673,0.0021803395357,0.00217843358405,0.00189838849474,0.00189386866987,0.0015070111258,0.00128855009098,0.00128855009098,0.00120418018196,0.00116852414794,0.000958139600698,0.000957167358138"

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,64259,"We ended up here because a couple of nearby places didn't take credit cards, something that should be more prominent in Yelp listings. It was about 7:30 on a rainy Sunday night and we had a great experience. We had a brief wait for a table for 4 because we didn't want to sit right by the front door; the space is small, with a bar and most tables set up for two. The staff was friendly and attentive, but not hovering. Substitutions and questions about ingredients (my husband follows a special diet) were absolutely not a problem, and the waiter even chatted with my 12-year-old about Tesla and TED talks! We all enjoyed our food, which was well-prepared and very tasty. There are a few ""kid"" menu items but my children ordered from the regular dinner menu. Our entrees were Pork Paillard, Boeuf Bourguignon (with mashed potatoes instead of risotto), Pork Charcutiere, and the Sandwich de Boeuf. For dessert we had a fruit salad, a Tarte Tatin, profiteroles, and a creme brulee. Everyone was pleased with his or her meal. I ate a bit too much by tasting my companions' desserts as well as my own. We spent about $129 for entrees and desserts for 4 people, plus 2 glasses of wine. The only slight negative was that the fries were quite salty.Update: We came again as a large group for a graduation celebration, and were less than ideal customers--we ended up being early, fewer than we had made a reservation for, and then requesting special items off the menu (a plain salad with chicken, dressing on the side). In spite of all this the service was totally accommodating and helpful and everyone got something delicious, from scallops with risotto to steak frites.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.69999980927,"something,couple,credit cards,places,listings,Yelp,experience,Everyone,food,space,staff,tables,table,wait,door,bar,dinner menu,waiter,dessert,menu items,risotto,fruit salad,problem,talks,ingredients,questions,kid,children,diet,mashed potatoes,creme brulee,profiteroles,Tarte Tatin,meal,everyone,Update,group,reservation,graduation celebration,customers,Sandwich de Boeuf,Tesla,TED,Boeuf Bourguignon,Pork Paillard,menu,husband,service,Pork Charcutiere,salad,risotto,entrees,side,chicken,steak frites,scallops,spite,Substitutions,something,desserts,desserts,negative,entrees,bit,companions,wine,glasses,people,fries,items","7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,3,7,4,1,2,3,3,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,6,1,6,7","0.219607830048,0.0875573977828,0.0745058208704,0.064161658287,0.064161658287,0.0382324717939,0.0307420287281,0.0247345045209,0.0235087778419,0.0143467513844,0.0139377936721,0.0133901992813,0.0133901992813,0.0133901992813,0.0117188608274,0.0117188608274,0.00983816199005,0.00898767635226,0.00897539127618,0.0084005407989,0.0081766564399,0.00816447194666,0.00786470156163,0.00786470156163,0.00786470156163,0.00786470156163,0.00783126428723,0.00783126428723,0.0077657410875,0.00715482234955,0.00714415730909,0.00714415730909,0.00714415730909,0.00713463081047,0.00541335716844,0.00531359575689,0.00531359575689,0.00531359575689,0.00531359575689,0.00531359575689,0.00484270602465,0.00465779006481,0.00465779006481,0.0046301279217,0.0046301279217,0.0046234917827,0.00456143030897,0.00438960455358,0.00423704506829,0.00420532282442,0.00420137494802,0.00387202389538,0.00367929949425,0.00367929949425,0.00367584475316,0.00367584475316,0.00367584475316,0.00340789929032,0.00309927714989,0.00293560884893,0.00293237203732,0.0027837601956,0.00266704708338,0.0023358957842,0.0023358957842,0.00233331974596,0.00233331974596,0.00233331974596,0.00230158003978,0.0020674909465"

Smooth! No hiccup! *in awe* (we gave him a 22% tip! Way 2 go dude!) Decor: lovely, cozy and clean... I like how they have both booth banquette seatings and chairs... So Paris' esque! Food: we had unsweetened ice tea... Boring... I know, it was 93 degrees outside...  No way am I adding more dehydration!  we grabbed 1) Summer item - steak sandwich, comes w/ steak fries (you know, skinny ones!) & green salad & a drink! $10.99 + $2 (Steak supplement, or Chicken for just $10.99).  It was delicious - even if it's not French dip! The steak was cooked just med - w/ delicious caramelized onion. The fries were piping hot!   2) Fresh crab/avocado/cherry tomatoes salad over green salad and 3) snail baked in olive oil/parsley/butter/garlic... One MUST get snail in any French eatery! (That's just me.. I love snails! French style, Asian style whatever! Bring it on!)   I enjoyed my crab salad - it was fresh cuz I bit on quite a few shells... And when you use the extra ""snail sauce"" along the green salad - yo'... It's epic!  Like trust me on this.  I was literally dancing in my seat... Like no one's watching. The only gripe I have... Why oh why don't you guys use that beautiful, soft churned, giant block of butter for the bread!?!?! Like all French eateries... I usually scoop it all up... I didn't get to do it this time bc the butter is just some land 'o lake frozen butter.   I miss the deliciousness of it and when I eat with my girlfriends..

The salad could be best described as boring and unappetising. A bowl of salad leaves with a few bits of feta cheese and tinned beetroot but no salad dressing. It went uneaten.The calamari was definitely straight out of the frozen food section of the nearest supermarket, quickly deep fried and put on the plate.Then for the mains. My wife's first choice - the signature duck dish - wasn't available, so she went with the salmon. I chose the steak cooked medium.The salmon dish: Did I mention the frozen food section of the supermarket? Add to that ""old"" and ""overlooked"". There was something else on the plate which I thought were carrots, but my wife is still unconvinced. On my steak, I have to agree with another reviewer (Arielle) who described it as ""medium inside, but super hard/crispy on the outside"". I'm not a great chef myself, but I would be embarrassed to serve steak cooked like that at my home, let alone at a restaurant.It was also a stringy, tough piece of meat, and that is possibly what they were trying to hide.Sadly I think they need a visit from Gordon Ramsay.",1.0 star rating,"Sydney, Australia",2,1,-0.20000000298,3.90000009537,"wife,place,wife,menu,French,wife,wife,salad,calamari,supermarket,gold,calamari,salad,wait staff,salad,choice,food section,plate.,signature duck dish,salmon,salmon dish,food section,beetroot,feta cheese,bits,bowl,salad dressing,mains,steak,plate,steak,outside,chef,home,piece,meat,visit,steak,something,carrots,reviewer,restaurant.It,Gordon Ramsay,Arielle","1,7,1,7,2,1,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,5,2,1,1","0.241838857532,0.134602695704,0.0964268371463,0.0644332170486,0.0404136218131,0.0374447889626,0.0361503735185,0.0352824963629,0.0298604909331,0.0297779608518,0.0261516869068,0.011392608285,0.0113889519125,0.011370186694,0.0113307097927,0.00994242075831,0.00954375602305,0.00954375602305,0.00951685011387,0.00871014874429,0.00869007501751,0.00869007501751,0.00838232878596,0.00838232878596,0.00838232878596,0.00838232878596,0.00838232878596,0.00835186429322,0.00746254203841,0.00723450630903,0.00705022597685,0.00565394526348,0.00564640434459,0.00564640434459,0.00416592136025,0.00391013175249,0.00331612327136,0.00311748404056,0.00296694878489,0.00248441239819,0.00248070503585,0.00231489469297,0.00231489469297,0.00146837625653"

The food was delicious and the wine selections were good (and they were knowledgeable and able to answer our questions about the wine).  We especially liked the goat cheese and vegetable dish, flank steak, seafood pasta, mushroom risotto, and mussels.

We passed it up repeatedly after reading the menu... something just didnt seem right. Should have trusted my gut.After reading several decent reviews here, we finally decided to give it a go. Its cheap, its convenient, several people wrote pretty good reviews, how bad could it be?Pros: They can poach an egg, and the coffee (when it was finally delivered) was decent. And its cheap.Cons: The waiter was terrible. Forgot to bring us coffee and the juice that my wife had ordered. We had to flag down a different waiter to get our drinks. Then he didn't understand what I meant when I said no meat on my Benedict (he may not have actually known what a benedict was).  I asked for spinach instead of ham, and he told me that the substitution would take a lot longer. I cant imagine why, since certainly the benedict was not pre-made.  Our food came rather quickly though, but no spinach on the benedict. I had also asked him to leave off the bacon that usually comes on the side. And what do you know,  bacon in my potatoes! My wife ordered a mushroom and goat cheese crepe, which came with literally a disgusting amount of goat cheese. We both love goat cheese, but it was like eating straight up goat cheese. And the accompanying salad was rotten. You know how a bag of pre-washed salad goes funky and gets that smell just before it goes mushy?

The soft drinks are refilled. We had some different orders: the crab cake, croque-monsieur, sandwich au boeuf, ravioli, and steak tartare. A la carte items included the trout with lemon butter sauce (was surprised but pleased to get a whole fish - not so pleased about the tail that was cut off yet still remaining on the plate) and pasta with clams & mussels ($16 each). The lunch special is fine if you're after a sandwich, but otherwise, you'll likely want something more, which is where they make money off of you with the a la carte items. The floating island dessert ($7) was okay; the raspberry coulis sauce was kind of sour.  There are much better French places that I would pay more for, but this place is okay for a quick lunch.

To the food: We had the goat cheese tart, coq au vin & the steak frites. Tart was solid, good cheese and onion flavors - the crust flavorful and well made. Coq au vin was served with egg noodles, button mushrooms and pieces of bacon. The flavor was also quite good and the meat was moist. It was a lot of food - I took the noodles home. Steak frites was good as well - nice chunks of rare cooked hanger steak and a heap of fries.  the profiterole desert was OK - the puffs were a bit dense.  All in all the meal was great.

The mussels & fries look good @ 12.00.They are currently not taking credit cards - but that is not mentioned anywhere. They have a 9.00 brunch menu that looks like i'll be trying shortly.

I was in the mood for steak frites, but not in the mood to leave my apartment so I was pretty excited to see a French restaurant with good reviews and reasonable prices that delivers to my place.The delivery was quicker than expected, and the meal itself was less than $20 so I guess you get what you pay for. I get my steak medium, and it was medium on the inside, but it was super rough, hard/cripsy on the outside, and difficult to eat. It's what I'd expect from a $10 steak from a diner but not from a place that calls itself a French restaurant.

Having been a fan of this place for a while, the last few times I've eaten here, and by few I mean 4-5 times, the quality of the food and service have gone way downhill.What happened? I do not know. My beloved eggs Benedict now taste like something I would get at a two-bit diner. It's not just that the food is being cooked differently, the quality of the ingredients is not the same. If the decline is a financial issue I'd rather they raise the prices than lower the quality. No one wants to eat sub-standard food when they have come to expect a certain level of quality. And the service is just not as good. The last time I was here, the staff seemed more engrossed in the soccer game than the customers and there were enough mistakes to make me feel that they either don't know what they're doing or just don't care.It's such a shame when a place that you once loved loses it's shine. I may give them another try and update if things improve.

One reviewer complains about the fries but they are FRENCH fries. Not steak fries. And they come with ketchup which you wouldn't get in France but if you want mayo they give it to you no problem. My girlfriend loves the beef bourguignon which is the Saturday special (they have fixed daily specials on the menu). I can vouch for it as downright delicious. It use to come with mushroom risotto, which was to die for, but they switched the side to something else but I bet they would make it with risotto if you asked. Those three things, hangar, bourguignon, and risotto are fail-safe. I have had a lot of the seafood dishes as well and have not been disappointed. The truffles they give with the check are enough for me for dessert but all of the desserts on the menu are very good.

This used to be our ""spot"".  For one reason or another, we haven't been able to visit for about a year. So, when we were really craving their blue cheese mussels and some of their other unique dishes, we invited another couple to treat them to this gem.  They were very excited to finally visit this restaurant, because we have been telling them about it for years.  While a part of the menu changed and became overall smaller, nevertheless some of the old dishes were still there.  Unfortunately for us, the blue cheese mussels were no longer there together with some of our other favorites.  For instance, they used to have this great cheese and meat platter, which was not available anymore. Besides the change in the menu, the quality has changed for the worse. Our entire experience was such a tremendous disappointment that I don't know where to start.  First, let me start by saying that the place is aging, including the torn upholstery on some of the chairs. Here is the strange part; the place was scorching hot like a sauna to the point where everyone at my table was profusely sweating. According to the waiter/manager, the temperature is set by the landlord, and the restaurant owner can't control his temperature. It was simply a strange experience as every one of our party took turns leaving for fresh air.  As for the food, let's just say that French cuisine needs to be cooked by those who have training in classic French food before they start becoming ""unique"". When we first started frequenting this establishment, chef Olivier was in charge of the menu and quality control, and needless to say that everything was cooked to perfection.  Now, when we peeked into the open kitchen, there was no resemblance of any chef, but rather the kitchen was filled with line cooks that were taught how to ""cook"". We ordered several appetizers and an entrée each, and none of use enjoyed a single thing on our plates.  We ordered figs wrapped in bacon for the appetizer, and they came slapped onto a white plate without any presentation. Whoever ordered the risotto at the table, agreed that it was high on salt and low on flavor. The steaks were chewy, and filled with fat. Any trained chef knows how to properly cook a steak.  The service is nice and attentive, but given the fact that the place turned into dinner quality food, I would not come here ever again.  I am soooo saddened by our experience, because this was our romantic spot, and now it's simply a forgone memory of what used to be. If you were going to ask me a year ago what rating I give to this restaurant, then I would surely reply with a five star rating. Now, I am reluctant to leave thee stars. What a shame it is when famous cuisine is hijack by inexperienced line cooks. Please bring back trained chefs, quality control, and perhaps climate control.  We miss the amazing experience that we used to have in this establishment each and every time.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,-0.20000000298,16.8999996185,"experience,blue cheese mussels,disappointment,restaurants,significant other,spot,some,experience,another,dishes,reason,couple,meat platter,restaurant owner,line cooks,restaurant,point,Olivier,some,part,menu,cheese,dishes,part,gem,favorites,instance,quality,some,one,menu,place,party,food,chef,food,quality control,menu,table,everyone,temperature,temperature,cuisine,place,turns,resemblance,thee stars,establishment,everything,kitchen,kitchen,worse,change,chairs,sauna,waiter/manager,landlord,air,training,experience,charge,perfection,some,dinner quality food,place,figs,service,spot,steak,blue cheese mussels,French,fact,memory,restaurant,line cooks,quality control,climate control,upholstery,chefs,star rating,establishment,chef,cuisine,time,none,rating,plates,plate,appetizers,appetizer,table,shame,use,entrée,presentation,bacon,risotto,salt,flavor,fat,thing,steaks","7,7,7,2,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,6,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.380186110735,0.0415331944823,0.0413808189332,0.0409452728927,0.0380723103881,0.0202512741089,0.0193982627243,0.0178258661181,0.016464183107,0.01640448533,0.014411624521,0.0143593372777,0.0140247456729,0.0134167149663,0.0106525756419,0.00965410284698,0.00930702034384,0.00896001886576,0.0073693501763,0.00703674042597,0.00686077075079,0.00683582294732,0.00624071806669,0.00569579098374,0.00548873003572,0.00544995581731,0.00544074457139,0.00508778868243,0.00494788819924,0.00467232009396,0.00460890587419,0.00459720147774,0.00458317436278,0.00457916921005,0.00450301589444,0.00419046217576,0.00418703630567,0.00418703630567,0.00417685788125,0.00417685788125,0.0041726231575,0.0041726231575,0.00416506268084,0.00409715343267,0.00403654295951,0.00397591199726,0.00388215924613,0.00380835076794,0.00380835076794,0.00380542571656,0.00380542571656,0.00366780534387,0.00366780534387,0.00365848816,0.00365445553325,0.00365074980073,0.00365074980073,0.00364732206799,0.00364413391799,0.00355714582838,0.00333199184388,0.00333199184388,0.00319971214049,0.00311385863461,0.00311385863461,0.00307364109904,0.00303506036289,0.0030158648733,0.0028337482363,0.00269858189858,0.00257735210471,0.00247780792415,0.00247647124343,0.00231794337742,0.0021514359396,0.00215044384822,0.00215044384822,0.00214805873111,0.0019878889434,0.00195865775459,0.00195497460663,0.00184788415208,0.00172368308995,0.00171032256912,0.00153508409858,0.00139072712045,0.00136986293364,0.00136892381124,0.00124587432947,0.00124502019025,0.00124421040528,0.00120015384164,0.00108993251342,0.00108993251342,0.00108918524347,0.00108918524347,0.00108847673982,0.00108847673982,0.00108847673982,0.00108780327719,0.00107619410846,0.000538278138265"

Almost, as if it's part of my job. It's crazy. We moved into Windsor Terrace after almost 20 years in Cobble Hill and were naturally excited to try the local French spot. What is up with the huge amount of 4 and 5 star reviews? Holy cow. What are you comparing this place to? (Actually, I know the answer to that question as I looked at the other reviews written by the 5 star writers)We had dinner there. I noticed a lot of reviews are for brunch. Escargot. It was fine. Enjoyable. Hot. Ate it all up. Not wonderful but fine. Mussels. Dry. Very little broth. Smelled way off despite ""arriving today"". Holy moly: I sent it back. I can't recall the last time I did. My wife kept asking me if something was wrong and I finally handed her a mussel. She sniffed it. Yup. Hanger (?) steak with frites. Oh my. So tough. Crikey. 'Floating Islands' for dessert: one huge square of meringue in a tiny pool.  Oh, then there is the wine list. This is a ""French"" restaurant. France. Home of the term 'terroir'. Home of the concept of protected geographic production regions. So, enjoy the ""Chablis"" from Argentina and a ""Grand Cru"" from California.

Le P’tit Paris Bistro,5471,256 Prospect Park W,Brooklyn,11215.0,3512,"I've been here 2x; the first was for my birthday nearly two years ago for an amazing dinner that I truly enjoyed.  I didn't get back quickly because it's a bit out of the way for me.  However, when I was sifting through Brooklyn brunch options and saw that this place that I had such fond memories of had a brunch with bottomless mimosas (my prerequisite to weekend brunches), I could not resist taking the ride over to South Slope or whatever they're calling the neighborhood this week.Brunch. First of all, the price ($16.99) is too good to be true for NYC; bottomless drinks of your choice between bellinis (a little on the sweet and syrupy side but tasty) sangria (which I meant to try but refills kept coming so fast that I forgot to switch up again), and mimosas (more champagne than OJ, can't go wrong there) and an entree. Entree wise, I opted for the steak sandwich with fries.  They're fries are simple and golden but very delicious.  The steak is as other reviews say, very good or bland. You don't quite know which you'll get on any given day. The sandwich was pretty good, the abundance of caramelized gave the sandwich more depth between the fresh baguettes.  The chicken sandwich was made pretty much in the same way with side of fries and my friend says it was pretty good as well.  I ordered an additional crepe on the side. I was disappointed that they only offered a wheat version which honestly wasn't very good at all.  I was really looking forward to a sweet dessert type of side dish and even drenching it with syrup didn't do it for me.  Another friend ordered the bacon eggs and potatoes; despite the look of the seemingly overdone potatoes, she really enjoyed them.  The most appetizing (looking) dish of brunch was the French toast which could have been so amazing but the egg was still funny. They didn't cook it properly enough to get the batter cooked into the bread and this was the consensus throughout the 5 of us at the table.  I'd still go back to order the French toast in hopes that it'd be better because it definitely has potential.All in all, this place is good for an inexpensive brunch where you get a little more for what you paid for when the food is prepped properly.  It can be amazing but it'll probably just be good. Aside from the accents in the place, it's still Brooklyn and not Paris.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,11.0,"toast,dinner,sangria,place,first,birthday,way,chicken sandwich,consensus,Brooklyn,bit,brunch options,wheat version,brunch,weekend brunches,all,brunch,ride,mimosas,sandwich,friend,whatever,neighborhood,prerequisite,memories,drinks,fries,steak,side,steak sandwich,fries,sandwich,Brunch,fries,friend,side,side,little,entree,way,champagne,choice,bellinis,abundance,depth,mimosas,baguettes,refills,crepe,South Slope,NYC,egg,more,bacon eggs,place,French,table,bread,hopes,OJ,all,place,food,accents,brunch,reviews,side dish,potatoes,potatoes,syrup,dessert type,look,Paris","7,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,4,7,7,4,4,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,4,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,3,7,7,7,7,4,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.281277537346,0.0910670757294,0.0897094011307,0.055429071188,0.0438744090497,0.0368200577796,0.0200980063528,0.0192250013351,0.0182499531657,0.0181081406772,0.01759618707,0.0175064094365,0.0123579371721,0.0101143606007,0.0101143606007,0.00838339887559,0.00806175079197,0.00789589621127,0.00765404896811,0.00720128696412,0.00685471110046,0.00669782143086,0.00669782143086,0.00669782143086,0.00669782143086,0.0066734701395,0.00645251618698,0.00626268144697,0.00609378749505,0.00607659202069,0.00604267744347,0.00603152858093,0.00599318370223,0.00585355889052,0.00570715265349,0.00551246665418,0.00550581561401,0.00515029067174,0.00515029067174,0.00465883640572,0.00450639426708,0.00450639426708,0.00450639426708,0.00446032965556,0.00446032965556,0.00442391587421,0.00408174563199,0.00407197792083,0.00407137954608,0.0039669140242,0.0039524785243,0.00361826666631,0.00339164049365,0.00334797496907,0.0032239689026,0.00321508734487,0.00302746426314,0.00302746426314,0.00302513851784,0.00266821100377,0.00263210712001,0.00262839812785,0.00209443434142,0.00209148251452,0.00200852402486,0.00164363707881,0.00152172031812,0.00152029073797,0.00152029073797,0.00133127323352,0.00133127323352,0.00133002258372,0.00123795249965"

However, when you are paying $29 for a meal for two,you have to give some leeway.When we arrived, the place was pretty empty. There were only 2 other occupied tables of parties of 2-4 people. However,  it took a bit of time for them to bring us our menus. The menus were crumpled printed sheets of paper (Groupon special, I guess?) We ordered baba ganoush and cheese rolls for the appetizer and both opted for the shish kebab for the main course. The appetizers arrived surprisingly quickly. I wasn't impressed with the baba ganoush. I think the one that tribe/sabra makes is tastier. The cheese rolls were good, but again tasted like the prefrozen ones I sometimes buy at my local middle eastern supermarket. Soon after we finished the appetizers, the main course arrived. The shish kebab platter consisted of very little meat and the meat that was in it was ok in quality (a little chewy/not terrible but not special). The desert, baklava, was decent.Towards the end of my meal,  I noticed that I had been drinking from a dirty water glass. It was sticky in a way that was not of my own doing. Since we were getting ready to leave, I did not request a new glass, but it did leave me with not the best closing impression.Overall, the place was decent.

Le Sajj,5472,8221 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,23435,"My friend and i had planned on going to La Maison Du Couscous, which was, to our bitter disappointment, closed on a Tuesday - now we know to call ahead. So, we opted to walk up 5th ave and came upon Le Sajj. I've eaten many home-cooked Lebanese meals, and was quite curious about this place, so thought now was the perfect opportunity to try a new place. My friend pointed out the empty dining room  as perhaps not a great sign (it was 8:30pm on a Tues night), but I really didn't want to walk back to 3rd Ave for other good dining options (like Tanoreen) so figured we'd try a new place (the 4-inch heels i wore that evening were not made for walking!). I should have listened to my friend and steered clear , because it started at mediocre and was downhill from there. We had our pick of a table (it was empty after all, save a young Asian couple on the side and a group of people in the back, relatives or friends of the staff/owners.). Waitstaff were friendly, brought out a small plate of pickled turnips, olives, and cornichons right away which were not the best i'd ever had but decent enough, and a basket of lavash which came eerily wrapped in plastic in the basket. I ordered a very simple fried fish dish, served with fried pita and tahini, which I had had cooked for me before by a friend's mom (who is Lebanese) and LOVED. Not here. They chose the cheapest little fish, fried them up in old oil which you could taste, unfortunately, and the fish were dry and withered -  the skin wasn't crispy and they had an unappetizing taste from the old reused oil they'd been fried in.  The fried pita laying over the top, which would be fried in the same oil as the fish to give it some of the flavor - also tasted stale and old, and again, like reused oil. I hate to think when the last time they changed the oil in the fryers was. A small pile of lukewarm, soggy, bland, tasteless fries accompanied both of our dishes - neither of us ate them after that initial taste.My friend's dish was better - he had a spiced kofte dish, which was not bad, and I wished I had ordered his. Mine also cost $21, way too much for what i got - my friend's cost $14, much more reasonable but still not worth it.Neither of us ordered desert - entrees were bad enough that we felt we'd be better off getting dessert elswhere.Needless to say, neither of us will be going back to this place, and I can only wonder how it is they stay in business if they've been cooking like this since their opening.

My chicken was fresh and tender.  My only complaint would be that the french fries that accompanied the meal were hard and appeared to be the frozen potatoes. The fish was very good. Our meal also came with dessert but we were just in the mood for fruit.  Mario brought out a large plate of sliced melon that was sweet and juicy (and not on the menu).   Overall, the experience was very nice.  We enjoyed the food, the ambiance and you got a good vibe from the restaurant overall.

We had a ""hookah"" and it was excellent.  At the end of dinner they offered us some Lebanese coffee (similar to Turkish-but different).  The price tag was actually very reasonable, and I will totally be back for more.Thank you Marwan for giving me a taste of home, and for giving Richard B. a real Lebanese experience!",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,9.19999980927,"experience,home,birthday party,Le Sajj,home,St. Patty,guests,beef tartare,Marwan,swing,wine glass,drink order,red mullet,bread,Everything,tartare,music,anyone,region,pickles,appetizer platter,Beirut,red mullet fish,beef pate,hummus,grape leaves,olive oil,Happy Birzzzzdayyy,more.,something,Sajj,hookah,coffee,dinner,end,home,price tag,experience,taste,Turkish,falafel,Lebanese,garlic sauce,fried bread,garlic,sauce,mom,tahini,Richard B.,Nelly","7,2,4,3,2,3,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,5,1,2,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,3,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,1","0.284757316113,0.173665553331,0.0758026763797,0.0433430075645,0.0427366197109,0.0379759445786,0.0275489706546,0.0262084957212,0.0258939862251,0.0245623327792,0.0139025067911,0.013555499725,0.0128066474572,0.00893341097981,0.00850545428693,0.00815709214658,0.00781741831452,0.00781741831452,0.00781741831452,0.00781741831452,0.00779939536005,0.00721615739167,0.00713787879795,0.00713787879795,0.00711192423478,0.00711192423478,0.00711192423478,0.00677088880911,0.00591430673376,0.00529315276071,0.00529181491584,0.00528732081875,0.00528196198866,0.00528196198866,0.00528196198866,0.00494201062247,0.00436356477439,0.0041764699854,0.0036540995352,0.00312748015858,0.00308166840114,0.0030503210146,0.00266102002934,0.00265746773221,0.00265746773221,0.00265746773221,0.00244919280522,0.00232495740056,0.00216319598258,0.00137797871139"

We had a large group and the restaurant did a pretty good job of taking care of our table. The downside is that this place is fairly small and we happened to be one of two very large groups so it was extremely noisy. The food was good and the portions were pretty large - it is definitely shareable among two people.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers (baba ghannouj, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, hummus) on top of our entrees. I wish that they served their sandwich menu during dinner too and not just lunch - their dinner portions were way too big for one person, and when you are in large groups it is quite hard to share.

Once we were seated and we were able to distract the staff from watching Underworld on the syfy channel  which was playing on a big screen TV behind the bar  (classy) We showed the waiter our voucher which was good for 1 appetizer up  to a $14 value 2 entrees up to $25 and a desert up to a $7 value.  Well that didn't happen... the waiter handed us a special menu made for the deal....ummm don't think so buddy.. We asked about the deal and he stated that the manager made a mistake with Groupon and this was the menu...  When we basically told him stop the BSing he changed his mind and gave us the real menu....What number bad sign was that? ..........My wife and I ordered Hummus and a Shepperd's salad 10 minutes later a busboy brings us some kind of bread that was in a plastic bag that seemed to be reheated in a microwave....by the way the bread had the same taste and texture as the bag, Another 10 minutes went by and the Hummus and salad came...They weren't bad... wish we had better bread.  15 minutes later what seemed to be what we ordered came My wife had ordered Grilled Salmon with sauteed spinach and grilled potatoes.  What came out was  A fillet of salmon that was obviously not a  fresh pc. of fish but frozen and cooked to the point of it having the texture of balsa wood.. Potatoes with grill marks on them but other than that they were completely raw and not spinach but what seemed to be a Birdseye vegetable medley that came out of a supermarket freezer.  I ordered chicken schwarma that I could of chipped a tooth on it was so dry.  I think the waiter was afraid to ask us how everything was because he disappeared for 20 minutes.  when he came back we gave him an earful....poor kid wasn't his fault.  But he did mention that this wasn't the first time the salmon came out like that.  When we asked for the manager he mentioned that he stepped out of alittle while.  He then offered us dessert when all we wanted to do is leave... which we did....Going to contact Groupon and tell them of this horrible experience.

Le Sajj,5472,8221 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,34876,"My friend and I were in the mood for Mediterranean food.  So one of our local buddies recommended Le Sajj a Lebanese Restaurant. So we gave it shot. We first lucked out with street parking right up the block. Now with the food: Pro:1. Hommos - beautifully plated, fresh, nicely creamy and good portion 2. Baba Ghannouj - Really enjoyed the hommos roasted eggplant with tahini sauce and the           tangy lemon juice. It too was beautifully plated and equally nice portion as their regualr Hommos. The above Hommos came with their warm amazing fresh  (OMG) Saaj bread.3. Sajj Combination Deluxe - this was their meat combination dish over a bed of rice. The meat consisted of shish kebab, chicken, kafta and lamb chop.  Each of the meat were cooked medium and very tasty.  There were about 2-3 pieces of each cut meat except for 1 lamb chop.  The rice was perfectly cooked and light and season well.  This dish was enough for 1 hungry person.  4. Chef Special Baby Lamb - was 2 pieces of baby Lamb over a bed of rice and pine nut.  It was delicious and tender. The rice/pine nut was a perfect match with the baby lamb.  Keep in mind that since we're dealing with baby lamb - the meat is small. So if you want something tasty but not very hungry - go with this.5. Drinks - I had my Grey Goose Martini.

My boyfriend and I have come here before and it always seems to be an issue. The first time we were there, there was live music and what seemed to be a bday party. It was fun and the drinks where reasonably priced plus they had hookah. The second time we attempted to go was a Friday night and the owner turned us away because we were just going to have drinks and hookah. Now I know some of you are thinking why would you bother going again, well after last night I WILL NOT be going there ever again. We decided to stop by. They had a live band which was nice. We had hookah and 3 drinks and at the end of the night we get the bill and see a charge for 40 dollars. The charge was for entertainment! We had no idea we were going to be charged for listening to music. It was never ever mentioned to us. When we brought it up to the owner, he was defending his charge saying that people come in there just to order drinks and hookah and just hang out listening to the music. What kind of ownership is this? If that is the case then it should be mentioned when a customer comes through those doors. I'm pretty sure that the rest of the Lebanese customers where not charged for entertainment. Needless to say, we will not be going there again and I will make it a point to spread the news on this place. Bad business all around.

I am SO not impressed by this place, for many reasons.When we arrived, at 8:30pm on a Friday night and NO ONE was there, it should have been a sign.  Leave!  Now!  Go to the Dram Shop for burgers!  But NOOOOO we're sadists, so we stayed.A few people filed in as the night went on, and ALL of them were Middle Eastern, so I thought this was fortuitous.  Methinks not!First, the hummus was bland and too lemony, not garlicy, and too oily, w/a few gray chickpeas floating in the oil.  My hubby loved the grape leaves though, said they reminded him of the ones his 'Situ' (Syrian Grandmother) used to make.  I ordered the combination platter.  The minced meat wasn't my cup of tea: it was dry and too nutmegy (my personal preference though- I don't like nutmeg).  The chicken was fatty and dry, but the lamb was good.Hubby got the steak- asked for medium rare, it arrived almost burnt.  The fries were lukewarm and soggy, and the side veggies were frozen corn/peas/carrots medley thrown on the grill for a few minutes.He also ordered a side of the fried Kibbeh, an old family fave.  It arrived frozen on the inside!  As they came to take it back, hubby insisted they forget about it, saying ""Really, it's ok, I'm stuffed.  Thank you.""  But they brought it anyway, so we thanked them and hubby asked them to wrap it for us to go.  When we got the check, THEY CHARGED US- $11- FOR THE SIDE OF KIBBEH!  I was irate.  How goddamned tacky is that?  Hubby's nicer htan me ;) but if I was alone I would have said something.  So you order a hot dish- it comes FROZEN- you said to cancel the order- they DON'T- then they CHARGE (correction: OVER charge) you for it??We had a $25 coupon, and the bill was STILL $50 (for a total of $75 before tip).  Absolutely outrageous.  Seriously, I was PISSED when we left there.  DONOT GOHERE!!!!!Oh, also, 8 oz. of diet coke was $3.",1.0 star rating,"White Plains, NY",2,0,-0.20000000298,12.8000001907,"Hubby,NOOOOO,hubby,dish,ONE,place,burgers,sadists,people,chicken,sign,Dram Shop,hubby,hummus,w,chickpeas,meat,side,cup,nutmeg,oil,Grandmother,ones,grape,combination platter,tea,lamb,peas,corn,family fave,minutes.,carrots,grill,inside,Middle Eastern,htan,something,charge,order,preference,correction,ALL,Kibbeh,Situ,Syrian,bill,total,coupon,tip,diet coke,side veggies,fries,DON'T,SIDE,KIBBEH,DONOT GOHERE,check,US","1,3,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,2,7,2","0.147000864148,0.125020027161,0.0868404880166,0.0367425531149,0.0363332144916,0.0363332144916,0.0359160266817,0.0358335860074,0.0348558314145,0.0318851657212,0.0293218102306,0.021310897544,0.0207923315465,0.0163439046592,0.0136905275285,0.0112572526559,0.010989815928,0.0105586554855,0.00980594474822,0.00944032054394,0.00924584362656,0.00923021696508,0.00923021696508,0.00923021696508,0.00921645667404,0.00920416414738,0.00919305812567,0.009182930924,0.009182930924,0.0084036719054,0.0084036719054,0.0084036719054,0.0084036719054,0.00839515402913,0.00812545232475,0.00623852340505,0.00623852340505,0.00623466679826,0.00623466679826,0.00621430762112,0.00615614466369,0.00594547437504,0.00568736577407,0.00546567607671,0.00546567607671,0.00515512470156,0.00431674486026,0.00431674486026,0.00431674486026,0.00430944282562,0.00397825287655,0.00397825287655,0.00369101949036,0.00340259820223,0.00313418149017,0.00255088391714,0.00202237162739,0.00162285170518"

I went with my wife and we shared an appetizer (hummus), that was supposed to be the best in NYC according to the manager of the restaurant (it's not the best; its mediocre). Our entrees were terrible too.  I had one bite and couldn't eat any more. My wife made it to maybe 4 bites of her entree. My rice pudding was tasteless and my wife's pastry with nutella, strawberries, and bananas was worse because it did have taste. I liked the staff but I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Now I can't say that EVERYTHING here is bad - I haven't tried everything.

I asked her to please go to the kitchen and make sure because she clearly had no idea, she came back and finally gave me the reply I wanted. I proceeded in ordering the Kebab. It came quickly, I only waited for around 15 minutes. The presentation wasn't to bad, there were slices of grilled bread over the kebab covered in sauce with pieces of garlic and parsley. It tasted awful, two bites and I had to get it off my plate. It was bland bread with ordinary tomato paste smeared on top with chunks of raw garlic and chopped parsley, eww! I was hoping the kebab would taste better, I mean its really hard to go wrong with lamb, well to my surprise it wasn't lamb!!! It was beef, not even a half-decent cut of beef, over cooked and unflavored. Again, two bites and that was it for me.

Unfortunately, I was forced to cancel the reservation and called, that same day, around 7PM, spoke to an employee, and cancelled the reservation.Earlier this past week, I made another reservation for this past Saturday, 17 November for 8 individuals at 10PM. Again, I spoke to the same employee.  He CONFIRMED THE RESERVATION. When I arrived to the restaurant last evening, with my guests who came from NJ, CT, and Long Island, I was first told that my reservation had been cancelled. That same employee, said that many attempts were made to reach me on the phone and that a voicemail message was left for me. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. If I would have, do you think I would have had my guests come from so far for nothing? At my insistence, the owner was summoned.Frankly, the owner was kind but had no sophistication in marketing or how to resolve the situation. He insisted that someone had called me to cancel the reservation. He also said that the previous weekend, I had made a reservation which was not kept. He said that the table had been kept for me on 10 Nov. - awaiting for my arrival. As I wrote in the beginning, I called to cancel that reservation. I know what it is like to have an empty table awaiting for patrons. Therefore, I would never not cancel a reservation I was not going to use. Anyhow, his response to me was absurd. Was I now being punished for last night (Nov. 17th) with no table because I did not keep my reservation on Nov 10th?What was clear to me is that this establishment had probably booked a very large group at the last moment and decided to honor that reservation and bump my smaller group of 8 people. How shameful and unprofessional.The owner made little effort to accommodate us. He said he was going to call his other reservations to make sure they were coming. He then said they were all coming and sent us on our way. We asked for restaurant recommendations in the area and he mentioned a few but said they were all probably too busy to take us.If it would have been me, I would have squeezed in another table, offered my group appetizers and cocktails, invited us (or me) back in the future - as his guest.

Even though the restaurant had over 24 hours to let give me a heads up, I got a call at 10:55am on Sunday (5 minutes before the reservation) informing me of this. Since it was pouring outside I asked the caller if they could at least let my party in to wait until 11:30...he said he'd ask the manager and call me back...he never called me back and didn't answer the phone after I called multiple times. My friends had to wait outside until 11:15. Other than saying ""Sorry. Next time 11:30"" there was no sign that the restaurant cared about this inconvenience. On top of the this, service was very slow (despite the place being almost empty). We ended up have to ask for the check several times over 15 minutes before we got it and ended up having to cancel a drink order because they hadn't brought it 15 minutes after we ordered it and we needed to get to the appointment.

The food is very good, the prices are not terribly outrageous, & the atmosphere (yes, it's crowded & loud, as are most popular joints like this) & (more importantly) the staff are incredibly gracious. My partner & I, seeking a ""change of pace,"" made the HUGE mistake today of stopping into a place just up 7th Ave called Champignon, which we'd passed by many, many times but never really paid much attention to because (a) we are devotees of Le Singe Vert & (b) there's never anybody in Champignon, never a good sign. Well, after patronizing Champignon today, it is very clear to us WHY there's never anybody in there ... paltry portions, very expensive for what you get, & some of the very worst service we've ever experienced in our many, many years in New York. How it is in business is a mystery, especially when just down the avenue, you step into Le Singe Vert & you are treated as though you are the most valued, important person in the world instead (as is the case at Champignon) like you've ruined their whole day by drawing a breath. So...you see why I am compelled today more than ever to sing the praises of Le Singe Vert, a great place, very warm & comfortable, good food, good wine, good times &, yes, very INVITING!!

I live in the neighborhood and want to say that there is a serious shortage of  French restaurants and bistros in Chelsea. Maybe that is why this place has lasted such a long time.  In any case, I wasn't looking for anything spectacular, just a nice bistro meal. The food is decent, but the service (mainly from our server, was atrocious). The runners and bussers are attentive and I feel bad lumping them altogether, but the waitress waiting on us was checked out and seemed completely disinterested in being there.  As for food, ordered the soup a l'oignon and the steak tartare, my fiance ordered the Salad Nicoise.  Our server asked how would you like the tuna cooked, ""rare?"", my fiancee said, yes, please.  It came medium to medium well. Barely any pink in the center, almost like eating tuna out of a can.The onion soup was fine. The steak tartare (I ordered the appetizer size) is a very generous portion. It was OK. Came with some nice watercress, and frites. What I'm really here to write about is the service. Our server was beyond inattentive.The minute, and I mean minute we sat down, I barely took my jacket off before she said ""Hi, would you a drink?"" - we hadn't had a chance to look at menus or even settled in.After that exchange and saying we weren't quite ready yet and that we'd need a minute.  We ordered our cocktails and placed our order.  But that was pretty much the last we saw of her.

This restaurant could be so great if it werent' for the euro trash male attitude.The food is basic, sometimes the steak frites and mussels are actually really good. I live in the neighborhood, and have sometimes dropped by with a neighbor for some really good french food, but what is with the attitude? It seems, and I could be wrong, but it's happened every single time I've eaten there, that when I'm with another woman, we're treated like stepchildren and hurried to leave, waiters are condescending, including the women servers,  whenever I'm with guys, it's completely different. Even though the waiters look at the man when you're talking, ok, I get that, just a foreign thing.  I forget that the male/female gender thing is still very different on this side of the world.

I have been there several times, always trying to give it another chance since it was right next to my apartment. The place fails in a few key ways. One of the biggest brunch pet peeves I have is when a restaurant serves _____ benedict (standard, florentine, salmon - take your pick) and they don't know how to poach an egg.  I don't really know how to poach an egg, and have never successfully done so.  This is why I pay to have others prepare them for me. ;) I have ordered benedict brunches here 3 times - ALL 3 were served with hard, overcooked eggs. (I guess I'm a gluton for punishment.) Part of the pleasure of the benedict is combining the runny egg yolk with the other flavors. No such experience here.  Also, they claim to serve ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice (for a premium price), but the taste indicates no recent squeezing.  The service is also lacking.  You often have to ask for the same things several times before you receive them. You should also bring your own butter (BYOB), as they serve it to you one pat at a time with long pauses in between. The long and short of it is, if you keep walking south you'll probably find a better option.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,-0.300000011921,7.0,"gluton,part,neighborhoods,neighborhood restaurant options,Chelsea,place,times,restaurant,category,apartment,brunch pet peeves,others,florentine,egg,egg,butter,pick,benedict,chance,benedict brunches,Part,ways,me.,Le Singe Vert,times,eggs,punishment,pleasure,option,squeezing,service,things,BYOB,pat,pauses,orange juice,flavors,experience,price,taste,egg yolk","1,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.414157688618,0.0804564282298,0.0804564282298,0.0756317451596,0.0421787425876,0.0200865324587,0.0175091437995,0.016274953261,0.0130271036178,0.0129605326802,0.0122123099864,0.0121904434636,0.0119368042797,0.010928876698,0.0109037114307,0.0102184647694,0.0101275397465,0.00991570577025,0.00921217724681,0.00904601346701,0.00902051106095,0.00872574653476,0.008664178662,0.00812290608883,0.00794278178364,0.00791629310697,0.00790450070053,0.00789396744221,0.00732333026826,0.00672671291977,0.00588012253866,0.00587460631505,0.00586947519332,0.0042761717923,0.00406482582912,0.00271717389114,0.00258879247122,0.00258566625416,0.00258281547576,0.00258281547576,0.00130526092835"

I went there regularly when I lived in NYC and now every time I am back to visit.Disclaimer:If I were stranded in an island and I could only eat one type of food, every day for the rest of my life, it would be French bistro food.The thing about bistro food is that it's usually really simple to prepare at home so there is not much need to go out to get it; specially living in South Florida, but I digress.The setup at Le Singe Vert is very much in keeping with a classic urban eatery, but it doesn't try too hard to look the part. The tables are tightly packed (which is a challenge when you are big boned...or ""fluffy""), but I enjoy that. Every once in a while you sit next to kindred spirits and your table for two might instantly become a table for four.Skip the onion soup. It's delicious, but onion soup is onion soup. Order the salad nicoise. I like to order it when I'm with my partner or a good friend because it's the perfect dish to share with someone else out of the same plate. I don't know. It's how I grew up eating it, so it brings back great memories.All their appetizers are great so I can't recommend one over the others. Probably the inferior one is the goat cheese tart.From the main courses, I tend to order different dishes depending on the season. My regular favorites are any of the mussels dishes, the duck in cassis sauce (It's phenomenal!), a plain steak with frites, and the skate just because butter seared skate would be served in heaven if there was a heaven.I like to start my dinner with a kir while I read the menu (even though I usually walk in knowing what I want).

And the steak.So we each ordered a glass of wine, 10 dollars each for malbec and bordeaux, he got the soup, and we each got steak frites.The wine was reasonable. He liked the soup.The steak was meh. It was a large portion of steak, 12 ozs, with a tiny side of fries and a tiny side salad, for 26.50. The steak was completely underseasoned. I kept adding salt and pepper, and this helped, but I felt a little absurd. The fries were nice, but that should not be the meal's upside. My husband asked for only mashed potatoes on the side, and his portion was also small, and they too were underseasoned, and had a weird consistency almost as if there was powder... a weird phenomenon.The service too was mediocre, not just because from the moment we were seated in the tiny crowded noisy charming french place, it took about 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us.

This is common practice for me (I'm a geek and my memory's not great when I've got the fire water in me).  Normally I would edit and allow this to be a jumping off point for a long storytelling review. BUT, in the spirit of my 100th review I will give you all, the great yelp community, a peek passed my facade, and will publish here, without any editing, the full email I sent myself. My summation is that Le Singe Vert is overpriced, but the service will ensure a good time, which is all you really wanted anyway and worth paying for. Without further ado...despite being drunk this was not good enough for the price. I had the seared tuna and it wasn't very fresh but admitedlly the pairings were amazing. Tomato and tuna??? (Eww gross!) No it was fucking excellent!! The fruit(tomato) and veggies were scrumtiopus and saved the meal. The waitress (maia according to the receipt) was intoxicating and made the absolute perfect wine recommendations. The two people in my party who followed her food guidance left happy and content. Maia is the saving grace of this joint and her bountiful service, grace, and subtle humor kept me smiling even as the couple hundred dollar bill arrived. The fact that I left happy after settling the bill is a sole testament to her proficiency as a waitress.She kids after I ask her to check on my espresso ""they probably heard lemon zest and got confused"" (seems to be a common reaction in NYC as the grills staff was confused by my request for zest as well). She recommends what turned out to be the perfect white wine and attentively brought it out within 90 seconds of my meal despite my conversation with her occuring 25 minutes prior. Attentive yet not overbearing, litterally one of the closest to perfect servers I've ever had.

Came upon this place for a friend's birthday and Bastille Day! The place was packed of course, but we had made reservations, and were still slammed in the front against the wall and with the doors wide open. I understand in an effort to produce an authentic French Brassiere feel, they keep the doors open and allow people to smoke directly outside. But in 100 degree humid heat and with the place packed, that was a ridiculous decision. I could barely breathe, I couldn't hear my friends at the table and I was sweating out all the drinks I'd ordered. All in all not the best way to enjoy a meal. The only saving grace was the meal itself! The waiter screwed up two people's orders and was always late on bringing drinks to the table. It was annoying and due to his blunders, we wound up spending close to three hours at the restaurant. Maybe this was all a product of Bastille Day and the craziness, regardless they should've been prepared. I enjoyed their escargot, although a bit too buttery and loved the duck that I ordered.

Le Singe Vert,5473,160 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,19334,"There was no monkey business at the Green Monkey in terms of their pre-theater prix fixe - I suppose you can call your prix fixe whatever you want but ""theater"" here surely does not refer to Broadway, well, unless, if it is off-off-off-and-off Broadway - of $19.95, plus $5 for dessert.  The price tag is here to stress the fact that there was no monkey business when it comes to the amount of food they place in front of you, the lack of which seems to be a common vice shared by many pre-theater menus.   Le PÂTÉ de CAMPAGNE - Homemade country terrine, croutons, cornichonsAt a glance, the appearance was correct - thick-cut and marbled with interesting small brown pickled onions, not the typical white pearl onions.  Yet, again, the appearance betrayed:  The pate tasted like the first foray into the art of pate making by someone, while reasonably competent and quite hands-on but lacks the experience and the nose (for you cannot, or want to for the matter, taste the raw pork and bacon) to properly execute the age-old wisdom.  My tip for the kitchen:  Doze the pate mixture with more cognac (did you go stingy on me?) and add some more thyme and other spices the next time.Les ESCARGOTS - Baked Burgundy snails, parsley, shallot, garlic butter Bubbling in their little green baths, the little guys are not missing anything in Burgundy, are they? Be honest and admit it, snail meat is bland whether it is fresh from the sidewalk or the can; therefore, you need the hot baths. The ancients in Burgundy had it all figured out:  A combination of garlic, butter and parsley will instantly shut up any snail-dissenters; and they were not wrong. Le DEMI POULET ROTI - Roasted free range half chicken, sautéed potatoes, string beans, garlic confit ""Demi,"" as in demi-god, demi-tasse and demi-monde, indicates that the object of the prefix is lesser or half of the original.  However, used to describe the half roast chicken here, Le Demi Poulet Roti, somehow the negative connotation evaporates. If I may say, it was fully half chicken, as far as half can go (Maialino, pay attention). Tenderly and simply roasted served with its own jus, the chicken exuded the well-meaning of the chef, somehow over-concerned for your sodium intake.  Said plainly, the chicken needed more salt. Otherwise, while it was not an inspiring dish, it was nonetheless far more than edible.  The well-cooked beans added some needed diversion from the full half chicken. L'ONGLET MARCHAND de VIN - Roasted beef hanger steak, mushroom and pea risotto, parmesan, truffle oil, red wine / shallot sauce Hanger steak is one of my favorite cut of beef, and it does not take a lot to turn it into a marvelous dinner.  However, the chef again seems to lack the touch of delicacy that elevates the food from someone's kitchen counter to the restaurant table. Perhaps a dash of reduced balsamic would have done the job, or bolder red wine for the reduction.  I do have to give it to the owners for serving, again, a full size steak with bone marrow under such budget constraints.  CRÊME BRÛLÉE and LEMON TART with raspberry coulisNeither worth too many words, these are your average creme brulee and lemon tart.  The creme brulee had the exact same problem as many of its peers, overly sweet because of the thick and not-fully-caramelized shell.  You know what it is called, when it is not fully caramelized? It is called candy, and candy has no business in a creme brulee. The lemon tart was probably not homemade; that was probably why it just tasted like every other mediocre lemon tart out there.",3.0 star rating,"Tokyo, Japan",4,1,-0.10000000149,12.6999998093,"monkey business,amount,prix fixe,prix fixe,terms,theater,dessert,beef hanger steak,Broadway,Green Monkey,monkey business,price tag,food,fact,front,chicken,snails,guys,roast chicken,appearance,lemon tart,pate,vice,touch,pearl onions,onions,appearance,someone,lack,coulisNeither,chicken,menus,country terrine,croutons,glance,pate making,art,foray,chicken,snail-dissenters,garlic,pate mixture,snail meat,Burgundy,problem,combination,half,parsley,shallot,garlic butter,baths,kitchen,butter,parsley,string beans,object,ancients,nose,wisdom,bacon,pork,matter,cognac,anything,spices,thyme,tip,can,sidewalk,garlic confit,potatoes,connotation,half,baths,prefix,demi-tasse,original,demi-monde,demi-god,LEMON TART,attention,jus,well-meaning,creme brulee,cornichonsAt,Le PÂTÉ de CAMPAGNE,experience,chef,lot,candy,someone,kitchen counter,food,red wine,dinner,delicacy,restaurant table,reduction,job,balsamic,Le DEMI POULET,budget constraints,bone marrow,owners,words,worth,Le Demi Poulet Roti,candy,dash,lemon tart,lemon tart,creme brulee,steak,Les ESCARGOTS,many,creme brulee,business,Maialino,shell,peers,chicken,chicken,beans,CRÊME BRÛLÉE,Hanger steak,chef,cut,beef,dish,sodium intake,diversion,risotto,pea,parmesan,truffle oil,sauce,mushroom,salt,L'ONGLET MARCHAND","7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,1,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1","0.0529190972447,0.04975823313,0.0404075272381,0.0404075272381,0.0353879705071,0.0353879705071,0.0353879705071,0.0343866534531,0.0270502194762,0.0263737831265,0.0225696116686,0.0206544734538,0.0192783679813,0.0168736185879,0.0168736185879,0.0149964299053,0.0137671986595,0.0137633979321,0.00967841874808,0.0087536117062,0.00822166819125,0.00803045649081,0.00789643637836,0.00738611537963,0.0073311845772,0.0073311845772,0.00730451475829,0.00730451475829,0.00678281020373,0.00651652738452,0.0064627896063,0.00644761370495,0.00641457363963,0.00641457363963,0.00641457363963,0.00639123376459,0.00639123376459,0.00639123376459,0.00628327624872,0.00572014134377,0.00538367172703,0.00533711072057,0.00525773176923,0.00512249255553,0.00510029448196,0.00492523843423,0.00491826981306,0.0049176630564,0.0049176630564,0.0049176630564,0.0049176630564,0.0049176630564,0.00489673484117,0.00489673484117,0.0048884539865,0.00479382928461,0.00456454558298,0.00431471178308,0.00431471178308,0.00431471178308,0.00431471178308,0.00431471178308,0.00430252356455,0.00430252356455,0.00430252356455,0.00430252356455,0.00430252356455,0.00429259100929,0.00429259100929,0.00427696481347,0.00427696481347,0.00427058339119,0.00421232357621,0.00416090013459,0.00391377136111,0.00391377136111,0.00391377136111,0.00391377136111,0.00391377136111,0.00391171593219,0.00390271493234,0.00389800197445,0.00389800197445,0.00382337509654,0.00379793834873,0.00379793834873,0.00352254183963,0.0034850386437,0.00337726250291,0.00334144476801,0.00331269321032,0.00331269321032,0.00331269321032,0.00331014767289,0.00290055922233,0.00289818644524,0.00289818644524,0.0028959591873,0.0028959591873,0.0028959591873,0.0028939533513,0.00289386091754,0.00289386091754,0.00289386091754,0.00289187766612,0.00289187766612,0.00288963434286,0.00272785569541,0.00271804002114,0.00270814262331,0.00270158913918,0.00267900503241,0.0025824457407,0.0025469486136,0.00251440727152,0.00251136999577,0.00251136999577,0.00231019151397,0.00200065108947,0.00200065108947,0.00192797591444,0.00192421011161,0.00182833091822,0.00160648848396,0.00159853498917,0.00145957281347,0.0014538418036,0.0014538418036,0.00135760649573,0.00127687538043,0.00127297500148,0.00127186137252,0.00127186137252,0.00127186137252,0.00127186137252,0.00127186137252,0.00127186137252,0.00108155352063,0.000752692052629"

It is not based on the great service I had for the first half of my visit.  It is this;  Alone, not my favorite at all I had dinner later last night. Ordered a salad with walnuts and pear which was light and nice.  Had a Stella followed by a glass of red.   Ordered half a chicken.  One of my favorite dishes in a French restaurant when done well.  Outside of France I used like La Halle in DC, the NYC location being dated and dirty ??? Anyhow chicken arrived not half but two legs. I like white meat the dark just OK.  From the time I had my meal presented I never saw the waiter until long after my check was due. Small space but was forgotten or ignored.   While waiting to ask of why my food was not correct in clear sight in front of me the hostess was picking and scratching right up between her ass cheeks. Lovely.   Needless to say I was not a happy customer.  Paid my bill tipped not high and then asked for the manager.  He was OK not OK stuck up for his establishment.  Was going to deal with staff.    Shame.  He did appear to really want to believe me.  My plate was gone with the bone truth.  He could have cated more  Nice place and good food so all other reviews that are positive I am sure are correct.    Its not hard though to take better care and leave ones ass alone in public.   Waiter did not appear to care at all. Never tried to appease me. One thing he did do was admit to me he had not come back to the table.     One food complaint.  Chicken had little to no salt which was very non French.",2.0 star rating,"Mooresville, NC",2,1,0.0,12.3000001907,"review,food,restaurant,taste,presentation,walnuts,half,visit,service,favorite,hostess,chicken,reviews,food,ass,dinner,pear,salad,glass,red,dishes,bill,salt,chicken,check,restaurant,half,waiter,dark,location,legs,meat,meal,space,French,customer,food,sight,front,ass cheeks,manager,Stella,care,place,Chicken,NYC,La Halle,DC,thing,table,food complaint,Waiter,establishment,staff,Shame,plate,bone truth","5,7,2,7,7,7,4,4,7,1,1,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,2,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,6,7","0.179997131228,0.0857183709741,0.0726821944118,0.0637367889285,0.0637367889285,0.035119432956,0.034868657589,0.0305384583771,0.0305384583771,0.0303830150515,0.0179678834975,0.0144931264222,0.0134389493614,0.0124573977664,0.0118650291115,0.0116412602365,0.011598973535,0.011598973535,0.011566279456,0.011566279456,0.0115171540529,0.0111125856638,0.011007043533,0.00974197965115,0.00923500303179,0.00889021437615,0.00886197667569,0.00883949268609,0.00794297922403,0.00776626402512,0.00775468954816,0.00774435093626,0.00773500977084,0.00772649189457,0.0076948502101,0.0075120087713,0.00709053780884,0.00706387497485,0.00706387497485,0.00706387497485,0.00704532302916,0.00685281958431,0.00610087998211,0.00524333957583,0.00484597217292,0.00459946785122,0.00459946785122,0.00459946785122,0.00432645855471,0.00362296123058,0.0036212282721,0.00354444445111,0.00230765365995,0.00230598147027,0.00230440101586,0.00230147829279,0.00230147829279"
Le Singe Vert,5473,160 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,12617,"I was looking for a French bistro when I stumbled upon Le Singe Vert.  Intrigued by the 4 star rating, I decided to pay this little bistro in Chelsea a visit.  When I walked in, I was automatically taken by a whiff of steamed mussels in the air.  I also noticed how authentically French the little bistro seemed with the low lighting and colorful art on the walls.  Even though the tables were a tight squeeze, I was comfortable.  It was a perfect setting to have good convo with a good friend.  Now to the food:I got the mussels and fries (of course I had to try them after getting that initial whiff as I entered the restaurant). However, I got the ""PROVENÇALE"" which consists of a hot broth of white wine, tomato, saffron and fresh herbs.  This restaurant does NOT scrimp on helpings.  When my order came, I was handed a huge bowl of mussels.  I was quite excited. lol.  As I plowed my way through the mussels, I came upon the broth which was light and nice.  I dipped my bread in the broth, which was quite pleasant. My friend had a heartier appetite, so she got the ""L'ONGLET MARCHAND de VIN"" which consists of: roasted beef hanger steak, bone marrow ""cocotte"", mushroom & pea risotto, parmesan,truffle oil and red wine-shallot sauce.  The steak was absolutely superb and tender.  The risotto was delicious and not too cheesy.Overall, this bistro excels in the food and ambiance.  And I will definitely be back to satisfy my French food cravings.  Also, I definitely want to try the pre-theater menu (4pm to 7pm) which consists of 2 courses for $19.95. lesingevert.com/pdf/Sing…And please remember that they only accept cash and AMEX.

We were attracted to the outdoor seating, so we decided to go out on a limb and give it a try. We were seated and we sat for about 25 minutes before receiving menus. That's okay. They were busy . . . So we get our menus. One of our party orders a drink. About 20 minutes later it shows up. Drink prices were not listed on the menu . . . it was an $11 bellini made with mediocre champagne. Seems a little overpriced to me.Three of us ordered omelettes with smoked salmon and goat cheese. It was pretty pricey to begin with, and we all agreed that it was extremely fishy. One of party even sent their food back because their eggs were uncooked.We received the bill after the sending back the food, and it was not revised accordingly. We send back the bill. Bill comes back. Still wrong. Bill gets sent back.They take off an item, but it's the wrong one.We've already been at the caefe for an hour and a half and we have to get back to work, so we leave. I guess we could have sent the bill back again and had it resolved for the third time, so that was our loss, but everything was taking so long that it hardly seemed worth it.Overall: Crummy food, crummier service.

First thing I noticed about this place is its authenticity. Everything on the menu seemed very decidedly French, the staff all had French accents and the 10 top beside us was full of a bunch of French rowdies. If it attracts that many legit peeps, its gotta be good enough for my American taste buds. The merlot by the glass was a bit sub par, but the Malbec was fantastic and reasonably priced for a gracious amount. We ordered the cheese plate to start. It came with walnuts, apples and a yummy quava jelly.There was a Camembert and a Chabichou. I originally took to the Camembert because the Chabichou was very striking at first, kind of resembled the way the elephants at the zoo smell, but after a few bites any taste of the smell of dung had disappeared and I was in cheese heaven. I might skip this next time because it resembled a cheese plate I could make at home for half the price but having it nicely served on a wooden platter with pretty silver serving utensils is worth it for a fun occasion. I had the pork tenderloin, which was perfectly rare for a meat of that variety and hard to achieve with pork. It came topped with caramelized apples and a calvados sauce that complimented well. Mashed potatoes were good, about what you'd expect. My veggies were a bit bland, but my dining partners were much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here. He ordered the Trout Almondine, which was absolutely spectacular. So good and not fishy that I could even eat the skin. Gotta work in those Omega 3's somehow. The portions were plenty, we went home in serious food comas. Which are, of course, the best kind of coma. Far exceeding the 'just got hit by a car' coma.We sat outside and just before we were served dinner the weather changed and it got very cold.

Nice bistro feeling, attentive service, good variety of choices, and flavorful food. I am a fan of Le Singe Vert!The Deets:Walking by Le Singe Vert a few times in Chelsea, it looked interesting from their outside menu listing and peeking in the window. Last weekend, we decided to give this place a go and try it out. Atmosphere wise, it is pretty much the French bistro type you would expect. It's nice, quaint, and inviting but a bit dark towards the front. A bar lines the left side as you come in and the rest of the area is bench/chair seating. We took a corner seat in the back and liked the vibe. Our waiters were attentive and were helpful during our meal, but strangely it appeared we had more than one waiter doing things for us. Not a case of too many cooks but too many waiters which was a bit confusing, but better to have lots of service than none at all I guess. For our first course, we tried the Le Pâté De Campagne or country pâté (terrine). I really liked this version of pâté as it was made with a much smaller amount of liver than other pâtés. Very enjoyable and I would definitely start my meal with this treat again. For main entrées, I went with the L'onglet Marchand De Vin (hanger steak in a red wine shallot sauce served with a mushroom/pea risotto) and Chris M. opted for the Le Tartare De Boeuf (raw chopped filet mignon with quail egg yolk, spicy cocktail sauce, fries, watercress, and mustard dressing). My hanger steak was great, full of flavor and perfectly cooked. The risotto was good as well, great pairing. I had a taste or two of the steak tartare, it was a good choice as well and had an excellent presentation.

We originally had a reservation at Elmo, but it was just too crowded and loud so we ended up here. Thankfully they were able to serve us and we were seated right away.Since some of the prices seem to be a bit high--even for a French place, we all decided to go with the burger. Admittedly, I was not expecting much, but was actually pleasantly surprised by the dish. The meat was seasoned well and cooked perfectly and the bun was very tasty as well. In addition, the onions were nicely done and paired well with the rest of the dish. I do wish I had more fries, but otherwise I was pretty satisfied.

Our server didn't try to guilt us into ordering drinks, appetizers, or dessert that we didn't want. Everyone we interacted with, from the hostess to the bussers, was attentive and charming.I told the server that I had a dairy allergy and they made sensible recommendations as to what on the menu could be made without dairy. When I asked them to confirm that the creamy-looking salad dressing was safe for me, they immediately doublechecked with the chef, and I got the sense that they would totally go to bat for me if needed.My steak was maybe a shade closer to medium than medium-rare, but an excellent cut and otherwise perfect. The frites were hot and crisp. The dressing on the side salad of watercress was a little bland but otherwise fine. My partner ordered the skate and said it was buttery and marvelous.We sat outside and it was about as nice as dining outside in New York City can be. :)The only damper on the evening was some entitled white woman laying claim to our table before we'd gotten up from it (and before the rest of her party had arrived). When the hostess quite rightly said ""I'm the one who decides how tables are allocated"", the woman made outright racist comments about the hostess's gorgeous natural hair and then loudly demanded to see the manager.

We ordered the goat cheese tort(?) appetizer which was delicious; nice layers of flavor and a good size. We shared the roast chicken and grass-fed steak. First of all, the emphasis this place puts on sustainable local ingredients was a big surprise and deserving of at least 1.5 stars. Secondly, a lot of Manhattan ""French"" restaurants seem to think that because they're ""French"" they can make mediocre diner food, over-charge you, and expect that you'll just shove it in your stupid taste-bud-less mouth. Well, this place actually cared about the service (attentive but not overbearing) and the food. The grass fed steak was perfectly cooked at medium and the accompanying sauce was an excellent complement (to a steak that was good enough it didn't even need it) since it had a nice buttery-salty contrast with the earthy bold flavors of the grass fed beef.The roast chicken was very, very good, probably great. It was juicy well-portioned, and carried an elegant and subtle citrus sauce. I would really love to give this place 5 stars, but it just wasn't ""OMG this is INCREDIBLE""  level.

I ordered a glass of rosé wine which tasted just ok.  It cost $12 and barely filled the bottom of the over-sized wine glass.  I figured it was about half of what should be served.  We shared the beet salad with blue cheese and walnuts and greens which was fresh enough but lacked a decent dressing .  Likewise, my roast chicken was a nice portion, moist and tender, but the sauce was too buttery and tasteless .  My wife had the mussels in white wine which was a very small portion again.  In addition, the broth was so salty, she couldn't even dip the bread in at the end of the meal..  Needless to say, we won't be back.  We have a much better option in the same price range in Murray Hill.  I'll let you figure which restaurant which reminds us of Paris. :-)",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"positives,bistro,French,half,service,swing,music,background,roast chicken,glass,greens,wife,bread,heat,rosé wine,beet salad,wine glass,sauce,bottom,walnuts,cheese,dressing,mussels,bread,end,meal,price range,option,restaurant,wine,portion,broth,addition,Murray Hill,Paris.","7,1,2,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,4,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,2,2","0.17468392849,0.103925734758,0.079799413681,0.0515320301056,0.050054512918,0.0498009473085,0.0498009473085,0.0498009473085,0.049717977643,0.0370832569897,0.0353096574545,0.0326680392027,0.0258557777852,0.0190146565437,0.016071125865,0.0146401757374,0.0145967928693,0.0139014841989,0.0127751948312,0.0127391926944,0.0127391926944,0.0116597181186,0.0116042420268,0.00992623809725,0.00868618674576,0.00868618674576,0.0060052331537,0.0060052331537,0.00600032508373,0.00479536969215,0.00464700954035,0.00455244770274,0.00381221598946,0.0035557593219,0.00355285126716"

Le Singe Vert,5473,160 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,38841,"Le Singe Vert has been my favorite NYC French bistro for years. It reminds me of a quintessential Parisian but more South of France bistro complete with French-speaking waiters. It has a French-Mediterraean vibe, and is my favorite brunch and go-to dinner spot in Chelsea. Le Singe Vert is a place I can bring a date or my parents. During brunch, they serve one of the best Eggs Benedict I have ever eaten, and it is consistently well made. I order it almost every time including the last visit a few weeks ago. Perfectly poached and runny! Their Salade Nicoise is also delicious with beautiful grilled and cut tuna steak. Don't forget the Bloody Mary! We used to come here maybe every other month for their Prix Fixe Pre-Theater menu. I don't care for the recent menu change which is more limited. Anyway, we've graduated to their full dinners. Les Escargot is fabulous! Le Singe Vert does duck well, both with their Cassoulet which includes pork belly, and with their Roast Duck Breast with Figs. Yum! My all-time favorite was a special menu Lamb Chops which I haven't seen lately. My friend and I both declared it the best lamb chop/rack we had ever had. Too bad it isn't on the menu. Their Braised Lamb Shank is good, but simply not on par with their special Lamb Chops. Le Singe Vert manager, please take note! =)Waiter and bus service is good, and the guys are friendly. The meal is paced right, especially for a French restaurant.

It was a wonderful & interesting mix and I hardly left anything for the dishwasher to clean off my plate.  My friend had the steak tartar which came with delicious fries enough to share.  This is a great place for lunch and dinner.  I don't see this place becoming too noisy and crowded except for peak hours i.e. Friday/Saturday nights.  Easy to have a conversation among friends while enjoying tasty food at reasonable prices.  Highly recommend for a cozy night with a friend or date.

The pasta was also slightly overcooked.  Two of my companions ordered the hangar steak ($24), which was basically a single skewer of veggies and overcooked, tough and chewy meat.  The meat reportedly was well-flavored and marinated.Overall we were bummed that such a lovely-looking option in the neighborhood ended up being such an expensive, lackluster night out when it came to the food.  I *might* give it a second try for the pizza, but otherwise, we don't anticipate going back.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,7.80000019073,"Farm,stars,ambiance,option,Lea 2.5,service,point,patio,food,score,weeknight dinner,options,baby,cocktails,menu,neighborhood,neighborhood,prices,dinner,pricing,dish,pasta,resident,preparation,brunch,meat,leeks,asparagus,Tagliatelle,greens,half,hangar steak,neighborhood,chairs,Adderley,food,pizza,meat,try,skewer,veggies,companions,Two","2,7,7,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,2,7,6,7,7,1,7,1,1","0.117243729532,0.0746490508318,0.0704102143645,0.0626521855593,0.0624178722501,0.0598650313914,0.0514256469905,0.0496195442975,0.0373800806701,0.0233549959958,0.0219418741763,0.0218623653054,0.019207932055,0.0191382821649,0.0191382821649,0.0161986183375,0.0161613393575,0.0147373732179,0.0147034442052,0.0147034442052,0.0140084708109,0.0139876240864,0.0128981629387,0.0128981629387,0.0128684546798,0.0119182802737,0.0117550445721,0.0117550445721,0.0117550445721,0.0117550445721,0.0117352027446,0.011673334986,0.0109745301306,0.00833621155471,0.00762484781444,0.00691515346989,0.00604398315772,0.00438750674948,0.00429264921695,0.00408986909315,0.00383869186044,0.00383869186044,0.00383869186044"

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,17868,"There hasn't been a place on Cortelyou that I've wanted to keep returning to when it's late. Sometimes it just happens...an already stressful week ends with a 5:30pm phone call that starts the entire week all over again on a Friday evening. And, let's face it, one of the many beauties of this neighborhood is that, if you have even a steady Starbucks income, you can afford a drink out once in a while.Anyway, when we tried to be the last customer at another place on the block (2, maybe 3 times), we received unpleasant looks even though the kitchen was technically still open another 30 minutes, and we kindly asked ""what won't make a mess back there, comes out quickly, and can be delivered with the check?""Well, with Lea, we've had a great experience on two nights that required the proverbial ""drink"" at the end of the workweek. The first was when I invited my colleague to drinks on the late side after she was nearly fired, and the other with my spouse after a day she (and I) hoped would never be repeated.The food...well...it's a delight just knowing that a mere 2 blocks away one can find literally the best treats (if you like cream and otherwise identify as a chocoholic) you've ever tasted in your 4 decades on Planet Earth: the chocolate-espresso gelato and the ricotta pistachio cheesecake. The food gets raves from everyone I know. And, the Negroni, which I've had twice, was spot on, although I keep forgetting to ask for it with a rock, which I prefer...Look, full disclosure, I've been a server in the last 5 years for one of Park Slope's higher end establishments that didn't make it through the post-recession economy. My advice to Cortelyou Road's latest and greatest is to keep doing what it's doing. I'm sure they'll keep getting drinks on the table before the food and be passively attentive with water without over-watering guests.

When we arrived at the restaurant we found out that the original protein had been substituted by a regular pork sausage that is usually served for brunch for two thirds of the cost. What's upsetting is that why was the protein substituted and served with cabbage for the same price as the original item and not 86ed. The substitution was so unproportioned that we had to order pizza on the side to compensate for a meal that wasn't even close to an entrée. The decision making on this was a big hit and miss.

Started with the lima bean crostino, and each had some of  the rigatoni and tortelonni dishes. Each of the dishes were well presented, fresh, and had presented some interesting takes in Italian fare. While some had mentioned portions being an issue, neither of us found that the be the case. I just wouldn't confuse this restaurant for a family style version.The pasta dishes were notable since the pasta itself is home made and makes quite a difference in quality. The Rigatoni was really quite simple and uses some ingredients more common to Eastern Europe and Middle East than would be to Italy. While I found that dish to be interesting and enjoyable, the other just wasn't my cup of tea. The tortelonni was surprisingly sweet and could almost serve as a dessert with the amaretti crumbles on top. Not quite overindulgent sweet, but more so than one might expect. The butter and chili in the dish didn't quite counter the sweetness as much as I would have preferred.While the food overall was good, service itself was a bit absent minded. Besides our drinks, which were served promptly, we also requested some glasses of water at the same time. Two additional requests were needed until the water had been brought out to us. Additionally, the server had place the wrong utensils at the table for our meal, making the overall dining experience a bit busier than it needed to be.  Hopefully that will work out over time and I can revisit again to give the pizzas a whirl sometime.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,7.59999990463,"dishes,birthday diner,friend,some,each,rigatoni,Each,lima bean crostino,neither,some,case,dish,dining experience,fare,issue,portions,water,pasta,dish,other,tortelonni,cup,restaurant,quality,home,family style,ingredients,tea,amaretti,dessert,top,butter,chili,Italian,place,server,Rigatoni,difference,water,drinks,requests,table,utensils,Middle East,pasta dishes,one,Eastern Europe,bit,pizzas,meal,service,food,glasses,whirl,sweetness","7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,1,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.176959171891,0.0788517668843,0.0788517668843,0.0541935786605,0.0460500344634,0.0432547070086,0.037963539362,0.0378985032439,0.0215974692255,0.020681578666,0.0176494661719,0.0169944092631,0.014906716533,0.014472627081,0.0144201135263,0.0144201135263,0.0132734095678,0.0127593651414,0.0126515347511,0.0115495566279,0.0115300696343,0.0103068454191,0.0102206878364,0.00971629936248,0.00971629936248,0.00971629936248,0.00969391036779,0.00967502035201,0.00883988011628,0.00883988011628,0.00883988011628,0.00881494954228,0.00881494954228,0.00857868418097,0.00814318656921,0.00799427460879,0.00783622357994,0.00754328537732,0.00751979229972,0.00735623575747,0.00657281093299,0.00656615104526,0.00656615104526,0.00656322250143,0.00604871893302,0.00588608393446,0.00574282882735,0.00519716879353,0.00471906736493,0.00454730400816,0.00394579069689,0.00345224374905,0.00323630706407,0.00322642782703,0.00289082457311"

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,20085,"Left very much to be desired, disappointing since I had so much hope for making this a local ""go to"" for a decent pasta dish.I had the bucatini with octopus. I generally love octopus and didn't think there are too many ways to screw it up short of over cooking/undercooking it. This dish ruined octopus for me. It was overwhelmingly fishy and overly acidic and pasty from the tomato sauce. The bucatini was cooked just fine and would have been infinitely better without the offensive sauce and just some butter and garlic.Hubby went with the pasta as well, I think rigatoni, with short rib and kale. I have never seen kale such a dull, over boiled swamp green color. Nor have I seen short rib that looked and tasted like boiled meat. Short rib is a ""can't go wrong"" for my dear husband, well here it did... Very very wrong. Setting appearances aside, it tasty gamey, dull and boring. He left most of it and out of hunger I kind of just picked at it till it was gone, cringing with every bite. We got the marguerita pizza as well, and have no serious complaints about it, would have been the safer better choice for a meal.We didn't send anything back as we decided this will be a lesson for us and we won't be back in the future.

I had helped a friend move to an apartment nearby and lunch was taken care of as a thank you.That being said, I would come back here with my wallet and get exactly the same thing. I split a margherita and bianca pizza with my fella, and we really enjoyed both of them. Crispy thin crust, fresh basil, generous helpings of cheese, we finished every last bite and only regretted that decision a little bit. One personal pizza is more than enough for one person, but not enough to bring home leftovers, so you might as well just finish the whole thing in one sitting. Certainly not the best pizza, or even best thin crust pizza that I've ever had, but I'd rank it significantly above ""serviceable"".An okay beer selection (four taps, some more in cans and bottles), but Lea gets the fourth star because of their excellent service. Every person we spoke to was friendly, and when they found out one person at the table had just moved to the area, we got some complimentary cannolis as a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" treat.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,93141,"We ordered takeout this afternoon, and while it was fresh and well-prepared, I was put off by what seems to me a comically ridiculous policy. Let me say first that I understand fully the irritation and inconvenience it causes a restaurant when you try to invent your own dish. The menu is designed a certain way for good reason, and if you need to alter it that much, it's probably not the place for you. However, upon seeing that they offer a pizza with prosciutto and arugula, I thought it would not be a problem to order it without the prosciutto- same price of course, just minus one topping. They refused to do this, and told us we could get an arugula salad and a plain margherita. Which I ended up doing- at considerably higher expense.

All three dishes were awful. Simply awful : sauce on the fish was too spicy, liguine and rib over salted. We had no choice but to send it back. In the hopes of still having a meal tonight I asked for linguine to be made again, this time with not too much salt. It came back 25 minutes later EXACTLY the same.  We paid for fries that we ate,which were by the way overdone and too greesy and wine and left.

This place is the most charming restaurant I've ever been too. Don't let the small size of this place fool you, they have so much to offer . I came here for dinner with my best friend and we were greeted by a very friendly waiter who knew the menu inside out , never made us wait long for water , ranted about trump with us and being seated immediately is a plus . I loved the wooden furniture , the dim lights and lit candles , funky art . The main bar is also really inviting , cute friendly bartenders who serve with a smile . This place is totally family friendly or a perfect date spot . Even though it was super hard to choose from all the Italian dishes that had fresh ingredients in season , we opted for the smokey pizza because a place with a wood fired oven must have amazing pizza . The first thing that stood out to me was the dough, it wasn't too thick or thin , wasn't burnt but crispy , it had the perfect amount of cheese, kale and smoked fennel sausage, wasn't too spicy , it was an excellent combo of ingredients . You can get other pizzas with toppings like prosciutto pepperoni salami or smoked fennel sausage which comes along with veggies that work well together whether it's mushrooms or cauliflower arugula or kale , they also have various cheeses like smoked ricotta or fresh mozz, they also serve a classic margherita. You can also add additional toppings for a buck or two extra depending on the item . We also tried the ricotta dumplings with mushrooms and it was in some sort of broth, but it was so unique and filling , I like how soft the cheese was inside and how it's topped with Parmesan on the outside , you can never have enough cheese. They also serve really nice seafood or seasonal veggie salads , fresh handmade pastas with meat seafood or veggies . I also love how they have wood fired steak for meat lovers and catch of the day for seafood fans . I also liked seeing interesting sides like rosemary cottage fries , where else can you possibly find that ?!. The best part of this place is the dessert and booze . I'm talking about ice cream sandwiches , cannoli , peach upside down cake , amazing hazelnut cake with horchata gelato on top ( it was so tasty I am dreaming of it now), other gelato and sherberts like chocolate and chamomile, some had fruits and interesting flavors . I loved their extensive booze and sparklers menu with fruity seltzers like watermelon or fancy red and white wines , champagne , Scotch and prosecco options .

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,30134,"This is a disappointingly sad restaurant. Although claiming to be Italian, they do not serve spaghetti. Do I care? Not really, but one of my dining companions had a taste for spaghetti, hence our selection of an Italian restaurant...only for him to be disappointed. If that wasn't bad enough, the condescending and inattentive waitress looked at him like he had asked her to commit a felony when he inquired as to if it would be possible to get the linguini with tomato sauce. You can't by the way. Their pathetic little menu allows no substitutions.Then there was the baked ziti. Served with one, possibly 2 teeny tiny meatballs baked somewhere in there. Stale as stale can be. Worst ziti ever. Seriously, the thing deserved a mob hit. It was that bad. An order of brussel sprouts came with a few pieces of cheese covering brussel sprouts that were BARELY steamed, almost raw and quite, quite tasteless.Coffee. No drip coffee, so on this cold Friday night, made even colder by the fact they placed us right in front of the door that let in a frigid blast every time it was opened (until we asked to be moved after 5 minutes) they brought us Americano and espresso. When my friend, the fiend who dared to ask about the linguini, inquired about demitasse, he was told they had it. What he got 5 minutes later was another espresso. Sigh. The one bright spark was the pizza. We all shared the pepperoni, after the disappointing ziti and barely cooked brussel sprouts. It was GREAT! Fresh, great crust, flavorful sauce and generous topping.

The braised lamb was unreal-- it was gray, under seasoned and didn't taste like lamb at all. We also got a pizza, which was better, but $16 for a small personal pizza. What bums me out the most about this place is probably the prices-- if it were just a little cheaper, I'd come back and give them another chance. $11 for a glass of wine and $16 for a pizza doesn't make this restaurant the kind of place you can drop by for a quick, casual dinner. I get that new restaurants are still working out kinks and developing their menu, and I'd totally come back to support them.

During my last experience (I've unfortunately been here 5 times in 5 years and they're batting a solid 0.00% at satisfaction) the waitress took our orders, and then ten minutes later returned and admitted that she should have written them down and proceeded to retake our orders. Sadly, even with a notepad, she somehow still managed to bring us the wrong meals. After more than an hour, we finally received our food. Unfortunately, we ordered the eggs purgatorio: a cast iron filled with wet eggs and wilted greens in a water sauce that's heavy on the water. Seriously, I can't describe it more clearly than that. I dare anyone to order the eggs purgatorio and write a pleasant review. I DARE YOU. Every day I walk by Lea's and when I see people inside I think to myself, ""you poor bastards.""

One night of the week - maybe Tuesdays - they have a large pizza special, with which you receive all sorts of fun, well curated toppings on the side - olive tapenade, pesto, chili oil, parmesan, etc. - so each person can decorate his or her slices according to personal preference. The nightly chef's specials are great - we had a lovely gnocchi bolognese recently and when they have the little ricotta dumplings in broth as an appetizer, those are not to be missed. Their dessert is great too - the twin order of cannoli is great for sharing. The ricotta ice cream with pine nuts and honey is a treat too. The space is airy and well designed.

It's cozy...We were seated by the door near the kitchen, which had a slight draft, but overall we were cool.We took some time to look over the menu and drink menu and opted to go w/ Smelts for apps and margherita for entree.for our drink - we went w/ the one that had sorrel in it. I don't remember the name of it.The apps was pretty good. The fish was slightly bland, but it came out hot(temperature), which I always appreciate and the chic peas were flavorful so it balanced it out.Our drinks were ok, but I wouldn't order it again...It had a bitter taste to it, not what I expected.We then sat there for a WHILE waiting on our pizza. Patrons came, got seated and received their pizza before us :-/. I wasn't particularly happy abt that, but whatever i guess at this point.Our pizza finally arrived and it was pretty good. I try to stay away from cheese although I love it so much, but hey it was a Friday night!Our waitress was nice and informative but after the pizza arrived, we didn't really see her anymore.

The decor, seating, and music were all enjoyable. CONs: Everything seems a bit over priced. We paid $18 for a smallish pizza, and $15 for an app (most were similarly priced). I'd be ok with paying that much if the entire experience was great, but we waited 25 minutes for our drinks, which arrived with the food. I didn't love my $12 drink; I've never had mezcal before and was told one of their menu drinks would be similar to a margarita. It's not. I would have sent it back, but the waiter didn't return until we were done eating. I left it on the table untouched. The waiter was very friendly, but over extended on a busy night.

The first was not bad at all except for the portion size of the steak. It came out as 3 small slices. Thank God my gf cant eat a whole pizza (the only thing on the menu worth ordering) and i didnt need to order another meal.Our first experience was not bad especially since we were just looking to grab a bite for dinner. This is why we didnt hesitate to come back.Unfortunately, we came back and it was not how we remembered at all. The environment is real nice with music and a very energetic friendly staff. We had a marvelous time. Then the food came out. We ordered:the beef ragu tagliatelle which tasted like something a middle school would serve ( and the serving size matched that too!) and the skirt steak served with what was once a potato and asparagus.Im going to start a new paragraph here because tjis dish deserved it. whoever was in the kitchen (because we already know you are not a chef i dont know what to call you) they deserve an award. Seriously! I think we discussed this dish for a full hour and could have continued talking about it bravo !!! Where to start... i guess its only fair i start with the meat. Cooked to perfection and doused in enough of the asparagus juice to make it barely edible( best part of the dish). Next well move on to the ""twice baked potato "" aka charcoal with a tiny remnant of potato inside. Lastly there was the asparagus, the stuff that the meat was soaking in its liquid. All i can say is during dinner i had to google bitter asparagus. (Do it if you dare)... based on the burn marks on it imma guess it was over cooked and not bad to begin with, though who really knows it coulda been both. This dish was completely inedible. To top it all off as we were discussing the lack of any culinary education in the kitchen we glanced over the bar to see one of the cooks lick his ungloved finger and continue to handle food.* note: do to the first decent experience and the fact the pizza was edible we gave this its first star.

Ordered our 4 course meal.6. Got served 1st and 2nd courses in a very timely manner.7. Appetizers were quite good: Beet carpaccio, Shrimp Cocktail8. Lea's Italian soda was good good too.And the bad starts here9. Got stuffed Turnip was was executed nicely but very one-dimensional flavor almost to the point of being bland. The waiter came in to ask how was everything. We both said it was just okay. Waiter asked if there was anything he could do to make it better. How do you tell the waiter it was just not up to par and was bad? Seriously? We asked for black pepper. Got it promptly.10. Got the next course: Prime Rib. Cooked nicely but the beets had no taste. I like beets and the first course beets were done nicely but this one was plain bland. So while the meat was done nicely the accompaniments were just blah.11. By now the waiter stopped asking is everything was good.12. Got desserts: Chocolate ganache was decent but the olive oil sprinkled on it was too much. Panna cotta was just fine.And it gets worse13. My partner went to the restroom but the host was waiting to get in the restroom that was already occupied. She realizes he's waiting but the host just goes ""You gotta wait; I'm going in next"". What kind of rude host are you? First I would expect the host to offer his place to a customer. Then even if the host is rushing to go the restroom, you don't have to talk down on a person who clearly realizes that another person is waiting in line to go to the restroom. Very rude Mr. Host!And to top it off:14. They were giving a rose to the women who were leaving the restaurants after their meals. Nothing for my date! Even after they gave one to a person who was walking out right before we left. Zip, Nada.Lea, I was happy with the service half of the time I spent there.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,45308,"Oy...Where do I begin?We just finished our Valentine's Day prix fixe meal at Lea. In the past, we've done Valentine's at Castello Plan, which I know is owned by the same team that did this place, and were relatively satisfied each time. And so, I made a reservation at Lea hoping for a comparable experience.For $65 we were presented with a five course meal. I'll go piece by piece here until it gets to the disastrous.First up, the girlfriend ordered a $10 cocktail which had toasted fennel seeds in it along with raisins and some alcohols. The toasted fennel added flavor, but wasn't fun at all to chew in a drink that was made for...well, drinking. The first actual course was a filo pocket stuffed with Swiss chard and mozzarella. This was more of a bite than a first course, and the mozzarella was either not there at all, or it was completely overpowered by the Swiss chard. Still, it was serviceable.Next  up, my girlfriend ordered the charred beets and I had the little neck clams in Salsa Verde. I've had tons of little necks before, but these were completely overly salted. The salsa helped a little bit, but I was left with nothing but salt in my mouth. Not good. The beets were good, but way too over peppered. My girlfriend coughed at the amount of pepper at one point, drawing the attention of the very sweet older couple sitting next to us.For the third course, I ordered the cannelloni stuffed with braised goat and ricotta, while my girlfriend got the tortelloni di zucca. We entered the restaurant at 7:35pm. It was 8:30pm by the time I asked our waitress where the pasta was. She responded at first that she didn't know, and that they were ""swamped back there."" Meanwhile, I know for a fact that people around us who ordered from the regular menu were getting their food faster. Pizzas, appetizers, main courses, all from people who got there after us zoomed out. We waited over an hour. When the pasta came, my canneloni was pretty good, but my girlfriend's tortelloni was too sweet (who puts Amaretti cookies on pasta?) and WAY too small; she got five pieces of pasta which was almost devoid of the chili that was supposed to be included to counterbalance the sweetness. FIVE PIECES. That's it.Then comes the worst dish after another fifteen minutes or so. We both got the goat chops, which were recommended by our server and were supposed to have curly kale and pear mostarda. Instead of the kale there was Quinoa, which wasn't really the main issue. One of my girlfriend's chops was at least 80% fat, while the other only had slightly more meat on it. When we mentioned this to the waitress, she attempted to try and substitute the chops for another dish of pasta, which was not comparable in size to an entree at all. She then asked if we would take the sardines as an alternative, but neither of us like sardines so we passed.The waitress took this as a cue to then bring out some sort of anchovy flat bread as a peace offering, completely ignoring that fish wasn't at all what she wanted. This is when the waitress told us she ""was trying here.""Oy.She finally relented and gave us the regular menu for an alternative, and my girlfriend chose a thin cut sirloin steak off the antipasti. It was okay, but not stellar, and was way too over-oiled.The desserts that came out were an assortment of sweets that weren't at all worth the price of admission. Five small one bite pieces.So for $65 a person we got one and a half passable courses out of five, with a portion size of about three courses and didn't finish our meal until 9:45pm. Yeah, over two hours there. They comped the replacement steak antipasti, but nothing else on our check. I'm usually not one to bitch about comps, but after the wait and the entree mess I was expecting at least a free drink or something. Not asking for much here (and we let them offer, didn't demand anything). We tried to voice our displeasure with the hostess on the way out, explaining to her that it might be a good idea in the future to only do a prix fixe to avoid excessive wait times on a major event like Valentine's. She explained that reservations were given the prix fixe while walk-ins could order whatever they wanted (which struck me as incredibly obnoxious, essentially handicapping reservations while offering anything to people who happened to just walk in the door). So essentially we should have just walked in and ordered three pizzas.When trying to point out our displeasure at the wait we endured, the hostess (and possibly co-owner) essentially shook us off. Well, we will shake off ever returning to Lea.

Other times you'd think that a blind mouse was cooking the meals over there. I went there ... AGAIN the other night with my boyfriend , and he had ordered a dish that visually looked amazing. Once he took a bite of that thing ... I swear it looked like he had broken a tooth. I , on the other hand had ordered ""Lea's catch of the day"" and let me tell you , it was more like Lea's catch of last month.  The dish had come out looking like scrambled eggs over Lima beans that looked like they were shot out of a canon onto the plate.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,197025,I ate here once before for brunch and it was great. The service was a little slow but I mean it's brunch. But today I brought my aunt and mother here for lunch. Me and my aunt wanted to have mimosas and my mom really wanted juice. We asked for the juice options and mimosa and they said they didn't have any juice right now. They told us everything was fresh squeezed. The place was dead. Now my question is why couldn't she or someone squeeze one orange for the tiny bit that goes into a mimosa. She was totally unwilling to do anything to make it better. When we told her we were leaving she said that it would be ready at 12. So if your restaurant is opening at a certain time wouldn't you be prepared for service? Maybe I'm just being a little bit of a snob but I work in the service industry and I know for a fact she could have squeezed something to make sure service had an extra touch instead of saying no and continuing with side work in a dead restaurant. Really disappointed because I thought it was really good and nice. But if you can't have the food AND the service then it's not going to be a place for most people.

Warm squid stuffed with standard filling but surrounded in a sauce that reminded us almost of a bloody mary.    Hubby ordered a refreshing cocktail with gin and rosemary which he enjoyed and was apparently very popular as the bartender was making lots of them.I really enjoyed the pizza.  The crust was very different than other pizzas I've had.  It was light, thin with lots of charred flavor and at the same time, almost doughy.There were a couple women walking around who seemed to be at least managers of some sort and seemed alert and aiming to please their patrons.  Atmosphere is nice, open, airy and cozy.  I would come back again for a drink and light lunch on a nice day...   and if I had money I wanted to part with I would try one of the pasta dishes as I'm a sucker for good looking home made tagliatelle.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,6.19999980927,"sucker,reviews,people,stars,expectations,squid,people,opinions,sauce,stuff,sauce,squid,pizza,Service,rice balls,drinks,app,bar,women,squid,entrees,entree,pasta dishes,one,review,Hubby,little,noodles,restaurants,prices,google maps,rant,filling,bloody mary,one,Prospect Park South,managers,Atmosphere,lots,cocktail,Flatbush,sort,patrons,flavor,Manhattan,The Farm,drink,pasta dishes,rice balls,lunch,money,home,tagliatelle,lots,pizzas,pizza,crust,them.,bartender,rosemary,gin","1,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,6,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,3,7,7,4,4,7,2,7,7,6,6,2,7,1,7,7","0.770260095596,0.02829307504,0.0210031531751,0.0184162352234,0.0184162352234,0.00936229620129,0.00810005236417,0.00709222722799,0.00660872366279,0.00649401498958,0.00595523649827,0.00456667365506,0.00424377713352,0.00401276629418,0.00386083452031,0.00382714043371,0.00337887392379,0.00337887392379,0.00307097658515,0.00277073332109,0.00257805641741,0.00257805641741,0.00257805641741,0.00257805641741,0.0025670977775,0.00240677478723,0.00234936736524,0.00225590867922,0.00225070607848,0.00225070607848,0.00225070607848,0.00224631675519,0.00204921071418,0.00204921071418,0.00200048997067,0.00194932788145,0.00186851038598,0.00186661665794,0.00174367823638,0.00168814905919,0.00165715150069,0.00152565143071,0.00152565143071,0.00152565143071,0.00133290549275,0.00133030384313,0.0012050694786,0.0012050694786,0.00111247994937,0.001054326538,0.001054326538,0.001054326538,0.001054326538,0.000988047104329,0.000842000648845,0.000832397199702,0.000800138630439,0.000670794630423,0.000670794630423,0.000670794630423,0.000670794630423"

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,581,"A nice neighborhood restaurant. Stopped by last night for dinner.We sat at the bar since there were only two tables left but both were tight squeezes. The bartender was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant is cute and cozy, but the tables are very close together. The bar was spacious, although there was a big party in the front of the restaurant and I got elbowed a couple of times. The big party was also very loud, with one man who extremely loved shouting. So I'm not sure if on a normal day it would be so loud. Kind of made my experience worse.The heat was also blasting, so it got really hot at times. But if someone opened the door and held it open, it would be super cold. They should invest in one of those plastic entrances to diminish the effect of the draft when the door is open.The food was overall ok. Not great, but nothing bad. The cacio e pepe was fine, but even for a pepper pasta, it was just a bit too much pepper. Some bites were of huge chunks of peppercorn. And the spaghetti was a bit undercooked with a very hard center. The shaved salad was a lot of shaved root veggies. Not my favorite, but the dressing was good - sweet, tart, and well seasoned.

We are reviewing it now after going 3 or 4 times and I must say no bad attitude, ever, food is delicious, drinks never a fail, nice atmosphere and deserts have yet to disappoint.  The one thing that bothers me a bit are the prices. I can agree on that. It isn't Manhattan rent you're paying or even Park Slope rent for that matter. You can go to Wheated on Church and Coney Island Ave and spend much less and have a bourgeoisie pie and highbrow cocktails as well.

About halfway through, when the waitress came over to ask us how the meal was, we said the pasta was lovely but there were no pine nuts in it. She said""Are there supposed to be? Let me look at the menu."" She left,  got the menu, read it, said sorry and she'd tell the chef. She came back, apologized, said they'd send a free dessert. How nice.About 3 minutes later, the hostess, who I believe might be the owner of Mimi's, came to the table, no hello, no nothing, just ""I just want you to know I spoke to the chef and he promises he put the pine nuts in. Maybe you just don't know what pine nuts are."" And she walked away.What I didn't say at the time, what I never say, is that I'm a chef. No need to--no customer should be spoken to that way.

My mom and husband both had the special egg pasta with purslane, toasted breadcrumbs and cheese. Very tasty and they seemed to enjoy. I had a great bowl of cacio e pepe which was divine. Service was very good and knowledgeable. I know it's very un-euro but I'd like a bit more ice in my cocktail or water.

I took the whole scene in and left. At a point in my life when I can afford to eat wherever I like, I'd rather patronize the friendly new vegetarian across the street.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,189295,"Wow. During our meal at the new Lea I thought to myself, ""I need to write a yelp review for this place!"" Our meal was great. We were a party of 4 and ordered three appetizers, the braised collards (delicious!), the lima bean crostino (super tasty!) and the risotto balls with pork and veal with melted mozzarella (lovely!). Our waiter was appropriately attentive and cute. The 1/2 carafe of wine was a great deal. And the meal itself (3 pizzas and a pasta dish) was very very good. We ordered dessert too and were really enjoying the whole experience. We got the check and dropped almost 200 well spent dollars...UNTIL... the bearded manager guy comes over a mere two minutes after we've signed the check and asks us to leave. I think the words he used were something like, ""I don't mean to be passive aggressive but we have a 2 hour wait for tables..."" I have never been a restaurant lingerer (full disclosure we were seated at the table for one hour forty minutes), also I was literally putting on my scarf when he approached the table, so I am kind of offended. It was very disappointing because up until that point it had been a really nice experience. We live in the neighborhood and enjoy going to all the great local spots. It's a shame that a good meal with friends and excellent service was undermined by this guy's anxiety. We may go back. We may not. But if there's ever a two hour wait for this place we would gladly go to the Farm (or Wheated, or Cinco de Mayo, or Mimi's, or Purple Yam, or Ox Cart, etc...) instead.**Please note, if we hadn't been asked to leave I would've given this place 4-5 stars.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,10.6999998093,"party,carafe,meal,yelp review,meal,place,Lea,appetizers,collards,experience,waiter,restaurant lingerer,meal,manager guy,mozzarella,veal,pork,risotto balls,lima bean crostino,wine,table,tables,wait,table,check,experience,shame,pasta dish,pizzas,dessert,something,meal,disclosure,scarf,place,wait,check,guy,friends,service,anxiety,Farm,place,Ox Cart,words,Wheated,stars,spots,neighborhood,Cinco de Mayo,Mimi,Purple Yam","3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,2,7,6,7,1,7,2,2,4,1,3","0.175758764148,0.0848768129945,0.0601307079196,0.0554916597903,0.0507216751575,0.0471633113921,0.0376110896468,0.0372847430408,0.0372847430408,0.0240421649069,0.021362517029,0.0178996361792,0.0154726719484,0.0146109396592,0.0142945954576,0.0142945954576,0.0142945954576,0.0142945954576,0.0142945954576,0.0142214950174,0.0118257859722,0.0109744165093,0.0109744165093,0.0109611870721,0.0109225455672,0.0108012771234,0.0106284460053,0.00958861783147,0.00958861783147,0.0095724221319,0.00954542029649,0.00878991000354,0.00872532930225,0.00872532930225,0.00814724899828,0.00814724899828,0.00806065835059,0.00742913689464,0.00650043319911,0.00650043319911,0.00650043319911,0.00648446381092,0.00586103927344,0.0044902889058,0.00413676444441,0.00383957265876,0.0031887635123,0.0028545614332,0.0028545614332,0.00265825469978,0.00265825469978,0.00265825469978"

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,196904,"Ok I'm going to start with the pros about this restaurant. Here's what I love: I've lived in the neighborhood for almost 4 years and Lea was a welcome addition to this area. They serve high quality food and the atmosphere is also great! Their pizza (I especially love the margarita) and pasta is amazing! They also have a nice happy hour special and outdoor seating. And they deliver. What I don't love: they refuse to accommodate any sort of change to a dish. For instance, if you want the ziti without the meatballs, they won't do it and if you want to add cheese to your eggs, they won't do it. I totally get that they don't want to compromise the integrity of the dish, however, at some point you need to accommodate your customers. I am vegetarian and would love to try the baked ziti but can't. Secondly I have tried to go here for dinner twice in the last couple of weeks. On Saturday I sat at the bar with a friend for happy hour and we were melting. I think we both thought they were going to turn up the air conditioning for the dinner crowd but it didn't happen. In fact, we watched people walk in and walk back out due to the heat. Yesterday I had guests and we were excited to go there for dinner. It's the middle of a heat wave and feels like 100 degrees. We worked up a sweat walking the 2 blocks to get to Lea. They had no A/C and all the windows open. We could not stay. Not sure what's going on? It's just not comfortable to eat in 100 degree temps with humidity. We were so disappointed as my guests had all eaten there before and they were looking forward to the food!

Second time around when I went with a friend and my dog (Pitbull) we were sitting outside (obviously) and my dog was sitting outside of the barricade, it didn't seem a problem at that time. However service was already inattentive at that time. Yesterday was the third and last time I was eating at Lea. My boyfriend and I arrived around 9:30pm to have a nice dinner. We took our dog with us (since it wasn't a problem the last time) and he was sitting outside the barricade. Our server seemed bored and inexperienced (he didn't know what whiskey's they had for instance). He took our order and our drinks arrived quickly (I had the Peppino, which was good). However our food took its sweet time (about 45 min for the first course to arrive) although they weren't busy at all. We mentioned that we been waiting for a while, the manager (who had some attitude) said he'll check. He never apologized for the wait or that the waiter forgot to ring in the order. We also asked for some water for our dog, that didn't arrive. We repeated our request and our waiter brought water and put it by the curb, which apparently now our dog had to sit there. Very rude. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 45 min later.... Our food made its appearance: We had the Asparagus, which was good, served with home made mozzarella and prosciutto. We also had the pasta Casarecci Al Ragu, which wasn't that great this time (under seasoned and too al dente). The third course was the Proscuitto pizza with arugula which was delicious as always. However the way we were treated by the server and management was below NYC standards. I work in the industry myself and this is definitely not OK. If you want great tips, change your attitude. Definitely not coming back. Unless they change their management and hire people with experience.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,11.8999996185,"dog,service,management,food,neighborhood,boyfriend,review,time,course,manager,food,times,star,stars,pizza,drinks,Casarecci Al Ragu,service,Asparagus,service,dog,problem,barricade,server,friend,industry,problem,order,water,waiter,wait,barricade,course,attitude,order,water,dinner,instance,whiskey,dog,Pitbull,curb,prosciutto,mozzarella,home,arugula,server,management,management,Lea,Peppino,way,attitude,standards,tips,people,experience,Proscuitto,request,appearance,NYC,waiter","7,7,7,7,2,1,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,2,1","0.0830506533384,0.0680099129677,0.0641035661101,0.0634029582143,0.057201243937,0.0559458211064,0.0475798435509,0.0455132499337,0.0432654470205,0.0360360778868,0.034902907908,0.0309381112456,0.0259687956423,0.0259687956423,0.0259687956423,0.0174629464746,0.0169079620391,0.0146987149492,0.0142750926316,0.0123770488426,0.012342161499,0.0098254494369,0.0098254494369,0.00869320333004,0.0085978852585,0.00840805098414,0.00786402169615,0.00727007957175,0.00660539558157,0.00658934377134,0.00658934377134,0.00658618099988,0.00656222179532,0.0059992368333,0.00599360652268,0.00598836923018,0.00577134173363,0.00575504684821,0.00575504684821,0.00535112433136,0.00509215798229,0.00465943757445,0.00445802882314,0.00390039710328,0.00390039710328,0.00389568740502,0.00387202901766,0.00364619819447,0.00363879394718,0.00342291686684,0.00340335862711,0.00321922707371,0.00307788117789,0.00269561656751,0.00269276811741,0.00269014155492,0.00269014155492,0.00263599073514,0.00171544856858,0.00171060033608,0.00159553217236,0.001436738763"

I figured that's how it was prepared and tried a few bites, I couldn't continue because it just tasted like something wasn't right.

The meat was presented very nicely, but it was already sliced so the chef had to have seen that it was barely cooked, I like my steak rare, but this was barely seared and cold ! Anyways, we didn't mind too much, it was delicious once the chef cooked it thoroughly. Lastly we had the Spumoni which was amazing paired to perfection with their cheesecake.

Five minutes in, they gave us a few glasses of water and by fifteen minutes we had our seat inside.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,21549,"Been curious about this new addition to the hood and finally stopped in today (well, yesterday actually) for brunch. I ordered a coffee and the ""Lea's Breakfast"". The coffee was abysmal... lukewarm and weak. I decided to have a ""virgin mary"" (didn't want to drink... had work to do) which was kinda tasty but salty. I figured it might have been premixed and the missing shot of vodka would have solved the issue. The abundance of ice cubes helped.The breakfast arrived, the egg (seemed like one... if it were two, they were awfully small) was perfectly scrambled with one leaf of kale, a tasty sausage, a paper thin preparation of potato (whose crispness was rendered soggy where the eggs were on top) and a slice of toasted bread. Not the most generous portion in the world but adequate for me, probably not for anyone bigger or hungrier. Unfortunately the dish, although almost perfectly cooked, was ALSO a bit over salted (and believe me...I like my salt). So I ordered more coffee (which, incidentally, was billed as a ""bottomless cup"" though my server never offered a refill). As she set it down she confessed that it might not be ""hot"" because ""brunch was over"". I told her that the first cup was just as bad, that the eggs were perfectly scrambled, and it was unfortunate to be serving bad coffee for brunch. If good customer relations were a priority the coffee would have been taken off my check but nope, the $3.00 charge remained. Will I go back? dunno... maybe to try a pizza.

After a long tedious day I was looking for a chill spot to unwind and have a drink, walking past Lea she caught my eye with her big windows, and cozy atmosphere. The inside is spacious and welcoming, with the noise level not being overwhelming like some bars.Sitting - There are a a bunch of little tables scattered around the joint so I'm sure a large party would not be a problem they will just push the tables together. The bar was spacious and sturdy, although a tad too high in the stool to bar ratio for my liking, but no where near terrible.Staff - Had a handsome bartender Adam I believe, who was quick, non-assuming, and attentive. Halloween candy wrappers did not stay on the bar for more than a minute before he threw them out, plates and silverware appeared almost like magic when I ordered food. And my plates disappeared without me even noticing after I was done eating. This is how everyone should be treated at bars, like you're on vacation at a 5 star resort. Marina who is the manager was also quick and nimble, whether it was checking in on a customer, figuring out a phone issue, handing out candy to the kids, or welcoming new guests in, she was not afraid to do it all. Food - Any place that has a giant pizza oven burning brightly in the back is ok with me. Had 2 pizzas both were amazing. I would call them European pizzas as they were not heavy, smothered in cheese. The pizzas were light, crispy, and every bit delicious. My taste buds are still recovering from the shock that came from tasting this deliciousness, I'm afraid they won't bother tasting anything else!\Drinks - The entire back wall is covered in bottles, no matter what you're drinking this bar has it. $5 Happy hour draft beers and margaritas I believe 2pm-6pmCleanliness - I did not notice any dirt or grim, the hooks under the bar were intact and not broken. The bathroom was clean, although had a large clear window in it, not sure why seems like anyone can just glance in... oh well.

Lea,5474,1022 Cortelyou Rd,Brooklyn,11218.0,178,"Definitely a fan. Also depending on my mood. I love Lea's because they have a very limited menu. I get flustered when there is too much to choose from. The first time we went there, I went with with my husband. It was wonderful. We ordered Iced Coffee, Cortelyou Mezze which consists of A platter of small plates including eggs any style, roasted potato, eggplant, fennel salad, grated cherry tomatoes and toast and the Challa French Toast. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. From taste to texture - pure perfection. Service was great too, we didn't wait for a table nor did we have to wait to be served. The wait staff are always on their toes ready to help. We did call a few weeks later to get some take out and were truly disappointed. They packed the food in brown paper boxes, so by the time it came home to us it was an absolute mess. (So never again). But I think they have since implemented that they will not deliver certain dishes. And I agree with that. A couple of days ago I went for lunch with a friend. We ordered some coffee, Grilled Polenta & Eggs which are Soaked in tomato sauce, topped with two sunny-side eggs and grated pecorino cheese and Rigatoni - Tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, basil and Parmesan cheese.Aside for the Rigatoni being a little under cooked (Hard, chewy and definitely not Al dente) everything else was great. The spices in the tomato sauce were superb. Spicy and peppery tinge to the finish). The Grilled Polenta was also tasty, perfectly cooked eggs on top.

I don't know if I would say that...but it was a great dish. My friend got the salmon which was delicious.

They took out the wave and got new tables and chairs and upped noticeably the prices and decided it's okay to cut corners. Was there Sunday night, after a play. Empty. fair enough--it was icy but still Le ZIe ALWAYS had a good buzz. We were rushed by waiter. in fact, as we were finishing our entree, they were breaking down the dining room. He so didn't want to offer dessert which we declined anyway. I had my usual pici pasta--formerly sublime--now a sodden mass of lumpen pasta with a few green veggies grudginly tossed in. the sausage and fennel my friend ordered had micro amounts of meat and fennel--all riggatoni and red sauce. The veal chop on the special menu--and I love veal chop--was $44. Really? I've eaten here dozens of times, brought folks here, celebrated milestones here. Hadn't been in a while--been out of town. This makes me so sad, as the owner appears to be the same {?} but, wow, the kitchen has changed and entirely for the worse.

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,59848,"I can't articulate my utter disappointment with this restaurant, given the glowing reviews on all research engines/Zagat.  The restaurant had good walk up appeal with outdoor seating and romantic lighting inside.  The restaurant was crowded on a Sunday for dinner, but we were seated right away at 7:30 without reservations.  Like the reviews state, it's loud - the reason it's loud is because the restaurant has sort of a cave shape that seems to amplify normal conversation - I could barely hear my friend one foot away.  On top of this, you can hear the subway rumbling every 15 minutes or so - the door was open so maybe this contributed, but I'm surprised no one mentioned this because it's very noticeable.  Getting to the food - we ordered the previously recommended steamed asparagus with mushrooms and an egg- well, it was as described....I'm not sure what I expected but the sum wasn't greater than the parts, and there was no seasoning or anything special that made you go wow - i had to add salt and pepper.  The mushrooms were sauteed in a way that was crisp and nice though, but again a little sans flavor.Entrees - I got the lasagna recommended by the waiter and my friend got the supposedly famous spaghetti and meatballs.  My lasagna had no tomato sauce - meaty and greasy and just not that special...again had to add salt, but just wishing i had tomatoes.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things and I certainly don't have high expectations for spaghetti and meatballs, but it was really just average also.To compound this, the service was incredibly slow - they were busy but it was slow.  Overall, Bar Pitti still takes the cake for the best Italian I've had in the city and beats this restaurant on every level (price, speed, people watching, food).",2.0 star rating,"Dallas, TX",2,1,-0.300000011921,7.19999980927,"restaurant,reviews,disappointment,research engines,restaurant,restaurant,Zagat,friend,cave shape,seating,lighting,seasoning,way,restaurant,reason,reservations,dinner,reviews state,door,sum,mushrooms,food,salt,mushrooms,foot,conversation,no one,subway,top,egg,asparagus,parts,anything,pepper,service,salt,tomatoes,meatballs,spaghetti,expectations,things,cake,food,little,Bar,city,level,speed,price,people,restaurant,also.To,Pitti,lasagna,meatballs,Entrees,waiter,tomato sauce,Italian,spaghetti,lasagna","2,5,7,7,2,2,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,2,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,2,6,7","0.101917661726,0.0814796388149,0.0714476332068,0.0714476332068,0.0521777644753,0.0487581752241,0.0425674244761,0.0383370406926,0.0347086600959,0.0342261530459,0.0342261530459,0.0255200639367,0.0242170859128,0.0222586803138,0.0159131865948,0.014906222932,0.013045527041,0.0129981366917,0.010452660732,0.0104285655543,0.00998192280531,0.00998192280531,0.00913534127176,0.00911752786487,0.00877961888909,0.00877961888909,0.00875484570861,0.00875484570861,0.00875484570861,0.00873465556651,0.00873465556651,0.00799365993589,0.00799365993589,0.00799365993589,0.00709586683661,0.00680187484249,0.00680187484249,0.00679173273966,0.00679173273966,0.00594253512099,0.0049641802907,0.00478437962011,0.00469678128138,0.00445410143584,0.00410927273333,0.00410927273333,0.00410927273333,0.00410927273333,0.00410927273333,0.00410927273333,0.00398430880159,0.00351839675568,0.00333994440734,0.0031794377137,0.00298917712644,0.00261513818987,0.00261513818987,0.00261071347632,0.00243255263194,0.00220481911674,0.00220481911674"

They have a good atmosphere, nice service and a very big and diverse (quality-wise and price-wise) wine list.I had the ""best spaghetti and meatballs of NYC"" and my wife had a Gnocchi - they were both good, above the average italian food. My spaghetti was cooked very nicely, the sauce was good but no great and the meatballs were soft and, might I say, just a little bland. Expect good italian food at a reasonable price (as of Sep.08, the pasta entree averaged $15), but nothing that's gonna ""wow"" you. Another positive thing is that the service is very quick, we didn't wait 10 minutes for our plates. For dessert we had the Profiteroles and they were just awesome.One negative that I have to mention is that the acoustics of the place are terrible! We were seated in the ""first"" seating area, which was completely full (expected, it was Friday night). The place was so loud we couldn't talk to each other without really raising our voices and we could barely hear the waiter.

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,196964,We used Le Zie for an engagement party for our daughter yesterday. We had about 70 people for a lunch and wine and beer. My wife and daughter and I were all very happy with the way It turned out. The food was very good.  we had a short menu limited to four mains.  They were all good delivered to the tables hot and freshly cooked  the staff very attentive and helpful. We used the whole front of the shop which is not so big but Claudio had the tables set up to maximize the space. It was tight but cozy and fun. This a nice place for smallish party and a lovely lunch.

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,39440,"I'm caveating this 2 star review based on that we sat outside and didn't see much of the inside.  At best though I only think I'd move up to a 3 star.The place was fairly full when we arrived, but we got seated outside immediately.  That was our first mistake.  While it was one of the first warm weekends in NYC and dining outside sounded like a great idea this place just isn't ideal for it.  7th avenue is a pretty busy street so there's lots of traffic, a nearby hospital so a number of ambulances blaring by, and right by a subway grate so there's a loud rumble to stop converstation every 10 minutes when the 1 train tears into the station.  Okay, well we decided to sit outside so that was kind of our fault and nothing the restaurant can do about it.  My major gripe was that the service was so slow to make pasta.  For a strange reason their list of specials is almost as long as their menu.  Personally I don't like when the waitress recites the specials list because it's just a memorized speech and I like to be able to read over the it myself, especially when it's so long.  So we just ordered an appetizer, salad and a variety of pasta entrees.  Then we waited.  We initially didn't have any place settings so we asked the waitress to send some over and a bus boy brought us knives and forks; but no napkins. So a second request to the waitress got us those.  She was very nice and apologetic about it, but I was still disappointed that it took so long and so many requests to get something so basic figured out.The main courses took about 45 minutes to arrive at our table.  We definitely saw a couple who arrived after us eating their entree well before we even saw ours. Again, the waitress apologized for the delay and said she was following up with the kitchen on our order, but it's hard to tell who's fault it really is.  Regardless of the reason the poorly timed service didn't make up for the okay food.  I had the spaghetti & meatballs that were rated ""best in the city"" and they were pretty good, but I'm guessing that award is from a long time ago.  Maybe it was the delay that reduced out enjoyment of the food, but everyone thought that the meal was just okay.My friends assured us that they've enjoyed themselves more in the past here so I'm just judging this place on my one experience.  Even if I had a better service experience I think it'd just be a 3 star restaurant.  If you came here I'd recommend trying to eat inside or going to another one of the 1/2 dozen Itialian restaurants within 5 blocks.",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,9.89999961853,"one,delay,specials list,much,inside,star review,place,mistake,weekends,friends,nothing,place,street,avenue,lots,rumble,some,spaghetti,service,dining,idea,subway grate,number,train tears,ambulances,hospital,traffic,waitress,waitress,list,request,restaurant,waitress,knives,gripe,something,fault,specials,reason,pasta entrees,kind,requests,courses,station,menu,variety,salad,appetizer,place settings,pasta,napkins,forks,table,NYC,award,meal,food,food,couple,star restaurant,meatballs,best,city,everyone,enjoyment,place,bus boy,waitress,restaurants,one,experience,service experience,blocks,okay.My,service,fault,delay,reason,entree,order,kitchen,Itialian","1,4,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,7,7,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,1,7,7,1,1,2,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,2,1","0.142875507474,0.070256754756,0.0595439001918,0.0533532574773,0.0513811521232,0.0513811521232,0.0395228564739,0.0259972698987,0.0243185069412,0.0195399932563,0.0159043949097,0.0125730680302,0.0115001397207,0.0113554690033,0.0107947215438,0.0107947215438,0.0107851400971,0.0107299135998,0.0093537569046,0.00929916091263,0.00929916091263,0.0092729171738,0.0092729171738,0.0092729171738,0.0092729171738,0.0092729171738,0.0092729171738,0.00915019586682,0.00872990861535,0.00871182791889,0.00833555683494,0.0078490562737,0.00765544222668,0.00748819066212,0.0074445810169,0.00728657841682,0.00713938707486,0.00711341015995,0.00711341015995,0.00709332618862,0.00665521994233,0.00646362034604,0.00633853301406,0.00626106234267,0.0062238802202,0.00620630476624,0.00620630476624,0.00620630476624,0.00619198102504,0.00608006911352,0.00566631322727,0.00566631322727,0.00565525330603,0.00550687173381,0.00515864370391,0.00502606062219,0.00481729628518,0.00481050880626,0.00471987808123,0.00448245927691,0.00421159621328,0.00421159621328,0.00421159621328,0.00420871051028,0.00420871051028,0.00394136318937,0.00377678778023,0.00369818205945,0.00365719362162,0.00365719362162,0.00333049846813,0.00332833291031,0.00291004544124,0.0028476791922,0.00232296437025,0.0021143455524,0.0021143455524,0.00211272039451,0.00206307321787,0.00184971303679,0.00184971303679,0.00172239064705"

Le Zie is a spot that I find myself going back to when in search of a casual, fun meal which is not going to break the bank. Massive menu: in addition to the already substantial printed carte, there are usually nearly a dozen specials, many of which cater to vegeterians or non-red meat eaters.Large bread basket greets you at the start of the meal - service is generally good, decent wine selection but I found cocktails to be slightly overpriced. Restaurant can get a little bit loud, especially as the tables are quite close together. Lighting is not too bright: good for a date.There are definite winners among the food choices - favorites of mine include the beef carpaccio (classic preperation with argula and shaved parmesean), paperdelle with braised rabbit (a relatively sweet, red-wine based sauce that more resembles a gravy), tuna ravioli, and spagetti with tomato sauce. You could do a lot worse for casual Italian around Chelsea. Tons of choices along 7th and 8th Avenue, but few, in my opinion, are worth visiting.

But there was no sign outside, and it was never open when I passed. A club? A neighborhood place for those in the know? Someone's living room? Finally I was there at the precise correct moment. A summer Sunday late afternoon, doors wide open, curtains fluttering in the breeze (or that effect, you can imagine). I went in, climbed up on a stool and ordered a Vermentino.The room is pretty.

Italian (especially the simple, rustic kind) seems so easy to mess up. The stand out is the olive oil - I like it spicy and appreciated the whole cloves of garlic - if you don't like a bit of zing or garlic, you'll hate it.The spaghetti & meatballs was good. Best in Manhattan? NO WAY. I've had better in Little Italy I think. But it was good. The gnocchi wasn't fresh - (gnocchi is hard to cook well, I know this..but it was barely edible) and the tortelli arrived hard/cold and was inedible. The soups were all thin and not hearty enough for my rustic italian tastes. The caesar salad was super ""Americanized"" and not authentic at all.Overall I'd say if you come here stick to the spaghetti & meatballs and maybe some of the meat dishes, which we didn't try. The pastas and fish (salmon - eek! way over cooked) were a total wash.At the price point ($12-$15 for most pastas), ($15-$30 for fish/meat entrees),  ($7-$10 salads), is good. You can get a good glass of chianti for $8 and their bottles are decently priced - a lot in the $30-$40 range.The lounge in the back (leftside) is a nice cozy place to hang out but gets crowded fast.

We have been there many times(to the wine bar around the side of the building, the sexier part of the restaurant) and always had a similar experience. The food is pretty good, the wine list is lovely, and the service at the bar is passable. Last night, my friend who is gluten-allergic ordered the gluten-free pasta, which was recommended by the bartender. My friend explained she is HIGHLY allergic and there can't be any cross-contamination or she will be ill. The bartender convinced us there was nothing to worry about.After eating about a 1/4 of her dish, my friend got violently ill and had to go throw up in the bathroom. We told the bartender what happened and she was very nice about it, if not overly concerned for her well-being, which was appreciated. She ran back and forth from the kitchen, checking with the chef and confirming that there had been no mistake in her ordering. It was the manager's reaction which shocked us. Clearly, something had gone wrong and we weren't making a big fuss about it, just alerting him, as you should in any situation of this nature, what had happened.This is the bald, skinny, older man who I originally thought was a homeless person who wandered in based on his dilapidated appearance. He was flippant and rude, unfeeling and not the slightest bit concerned for my poisoned friend. He even gave us a hard time about it, taking no responsibility and being argumentative! We weren't trying to get a comped bill, we were just telling him what happened and perhaps looking for an explanation or at least an apology and promise to look into the matter for future guests. He had zero interest in the matter and practically ignored us. We were furious, considering we just spent almost $150 dollars and were being treated like garbage.

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,16650,"Death by spaghetti and meatballs. This was the verdict as I sat slumped on the sofa with a glazed look in my eyes, consoling my belly from the massive plate of pasta that Le Zie served me that night.During our first Valentine's Day together many moons ago, the boy took me here to feast on a large shellfish tower, delicately prepared monk fish, and a delicious lamb shank with silky meat that fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. It's nice to see that those dishes remain the same on the menu. On a quiet Sunday night, Le Zie was the only restaurant in the area that was packed. Definitely a local favorite around these parts. The bustling dining room could be heard from the street as we walked by in search of a meal. The pasta dishes looked large enough to share with others as a primi or as a main course for one. Out of all the mouth watering pasta dishes listed in front of me, I opted for the famous spaghetti & meatballs - a dish I would never consider ordering while dining out but as it's touted as the best in NYC, why not. The white asparagus with prosciutto appetizer, a special for the night, was an appropriately light choice to precede the heavier dish to come. The spaghetti arrived on a plate the size of my head. The tender meatballs bathed in cheesy, tangy tomato sauce was pure comfort on a plate. Although slightly overcooked, the spaghetti sopped up the sauce nicely, leaving no trace of it by the meal's end. A total value at $15, this dish could serve as two meals for myself however my beastly dining companion decided to clean my plate. Not that his perfectly cooked strip steak wasn't substantial enough. The spaghetti was just that good. Le Zie makes for a perfect casual date night with none of the regular entrees topping $20. The atmosphere is truly low key yet lively, encouraging long conversation or perhaps long deep stares into your partner's eyes. If he's not taking you back to his place right after, you can linger longer at Le Zie's lounge and wine bar towards the back for some of that liquid courage.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,9.60000038147,"verdict,plate,spaghetti,meatballs,Death,Le Zie,pasta,eyes,lamb shank,belly,look,moons,sofa,asparagus,dish,spaghetti,dishes,conversation,Valentine's Day,meat,area,mouth,boy,dining companion,pasta dishes,bone,monk fish,shellfish tower,same,menu,tender meatballs,pasta dishes,spaghetti,dish,meatballs,meal,plate,spaghetti,parts,course,restaurant,favorite,search,street,dining room,one,others,primi,front,plate,best,special,prosciutto appetizer,head,size,strip steak,dish,entrees,none,key,mouth,trace,NYC,partner,eyes,courage,value,stares,place,wine bar,lounge,back,some,plate,meal,meals,tomato sauce,sauce,comfort,end","7,7,6,7,4,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,4,7,2,7,1,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,6,2,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0821127444506,0.0803834423423,0.067248634994,0.0633961185813,0.0470864884555,0.0386623442173,0.0282618198544,0.0257222168148,0.0248507205397,0.0225229561329,0.0225229561329,0.0225229561329,0.0225229561329,0.0224272254854,0.0219596829265,0.0203928649426,0.0162580367178,0.0150447972119,0.0133638000116,0.0116544086486,0.0112615684047,0.0098521374166,0.00966177135706,0.00941241160035,0.00864197779447,0.00862170755863,0.00862170755863,0.00862170755863,0.00857757497579,0.00857757497579,0.00841884501278,0.0082292240113,0.00821450259537,0.00789740122855,0.00773605611175,0.00721439439803,0.00705994432792,0.00665495125577,0.00657759606838,0.00654962658882,0.00614908710122,0.00575542729348,0.00574215035886,0.00574215035886,0.00574215035886,0.00573094841093,0.00573094841093,0.00573094841093,0.00572126265615,0.00525822071359,0.00523574836552,0.00522794108838,0.00522794108838,0.00522096734494,0.00522096734494,0.00463846744969,0.00422572204843,0.00387780042365,0.00387780042365,0.00387482182123,0.00360455969349,0.00338544277474,0.00310012768023,0.00306646618992,0.00306646618992,0.00306424475275,0.00279633002356,0.00268282508478,0.00268088141456,0.00268088141456,0.00268088141456,0.00268088141456,0.00268088141456,0.00231173145585,0.00214539468288,0.00203721527942,0.00195340486243,0.00195125071332,0.00182082469109,0.00170706235804"

I covered Tribeca to the Lower East Side, up and down and sideways across the city until finally coming across a place with the ambiance to fit my mood and tired tootsies. It was the lounge of Le Zie - quietly tucked off the street, candle lit, and softly whispering my name. Actually, I think it whispered something more like ""Enough walking already... you like alcohol and it's inside....."" I snuggled into a bar seat with my name on it, and within seconds was greeted by a sweet bartender. Together, we tackled Hendricks. She poured and shook, I sipped and slurped. Talk about teamwork. I think my only disappointing moment was that she set the mini javelin of olives on her bar mat for a second, but she made it up to me by over pouring. I ordered an appetizer of braised octopus, sundried tomatoes, and chickpeas... tossed in a tapenade or something of the sort ($12).

Wait staff are nice, and offered to store my cake in the fridge while we dined. :)The entrees are just enough to fill (might be less for a dump truck like me) but very tasty. The swordfish was grilled well enough and topped with a sweetened hollandaise like sauce, and side with olive oil roasted Brussels sprouts (actually liked that more than the fish)! Definitely a side order to add if your dish doesn't come with it on the side.Second dish was the fresh tuna ravioli, which was quite good. Kinda expected the tuna to be overcooked and somewhat pasty, but surprisingly it wasn't. The pasta was topped with diced fresh tomatoes (undercooked so it didn't fall apart). The other side was roasted potatoes. They were approximately golf ball sizes cut in half, and I think roasted under high heat to dehydrate and crisp the skin (They had a texture similar to mini fried baked potatoes).

We've decided to start picking ones we liked the look of and going out every month to a new place. Le Zie was the first on our list! Although on a first glance the place doesn't look super flashy, it's cute decor and warm friendly feel is very inviting. It was a lovely summers evening so we sat outside and had a beautiful view of the empire state building. The service was fantastic, very friendly, regularly checking back on us to see if we needed anything, but without being too in your face. All the food was delicious, I had the Goats cheese to start and my partner had the shrimp cakes. Both were wonderful. Then for our mains, salmon with a horseradish crust and sword fish with egg plant (among other veggies). This was easily the best salmon I have EVER had! Perhaps a little on the pricier side for the size of the portions, but we did not mind as everything else was so fantastic.

When we tried to glance over to parents to nicely imply there children were annoying all other diners, they simply turned and whispered to each other, acting like school children themselves. Then the children started circling our table, almost as if on their parents request. We spoke to the manager twice, he simply said "" I know, but I can't tell parents how to parent."" We were made to feel out of line, and rude. Eventually our tables got into a verbal argument. The restaurant did nothing to intervene. Eventually when they left they started talking to the staff in Spanish about us, little did they know we understood every word they said. It was so vulgar I cannot repeat it on Yelp. When we again confronted the establishment, they actually stated "" the good thing is our staff didn't get involved"".I do not believe it is wrong for a restaurant request that diners keep their children seated and well behaved.

Beyond that, the services was very good and staff was friendly.The cocktail menu is unique for Italian places.  I would recommend ""Spice"" which was a vodka pear based drink.  Margaritas were also good.As for the food, I was not a big fan of mac and cheese.  Maybe I was expecting way too much after all the hype listed below in other reviews.  For appetizers, I would recommend - Baked Goat Cheese.  We also got a mushroom truffle special.  For main course, I went with the Penne with spicy tomato sauce.  Ricotta and Spinach tortelli my friend ordered was really good too.  Even though you might be full, make sure to get the desert in Cioccolatissimo.  The place is literally on top of a subway line so every 20-30 minutes, the place would shake (sound like shaking) if you sit in the front room.  I would recommend the back room if you are on a date (seating is limited in the back).",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,7.59999990463,"place,place,shortage,area,reviews,restaurants,recommendation,dinner seating,rooms,Italian,Spice,bar tender,dinning room,room,back,back,lounge area,bars,lot,places,cocktail menu,services,place,drinks,cheese,reviews,staff,vodka pear,Margaritas,food,fan,place,Goat Cheese,mac,hype,appetizers,desert,subway line,top,room,back room,good.As,back,seating,Cioccolatissimo,tortelli,mushroom truffle,tomato sauce,course,friend,Ricotta,Penne,Spinach","7,7,7,2,5,2,7,7,2,2,6,7,2,2,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,7","0.0904224067926,0.0799483656883,0.0774585977197,0.0724070742726,0.0724070742726,0.0635428056121,0.0635428056121,0.0503249391913,0.0351599380374,0.0322518385947,0.0316206999123,0.0228964034468,0.0208203792572,0.0205597486347,0.0147111071274,0.0146360006183,0.0133853247389,0.0117162559181,0.0116563765332,0.0112302368507,0.00958084594458,0.00934154819697,0.00928668864071,0.00896705780178,0.0081492094323,0.00813545286655,0.00782527215779,0.00780723895878,0.00779202440754,0.00779202440754,0.00759728625417,0.00758487172425,0.00715770991519,0.00713141495362,0.00711937202141,0.00710876611993,0.00681209517643,0.00528311589733,0.00528311589733,0.00525401625782,0.00462486920878,0.00461595552042,0.0045932168141,0.00417793029919,0.00313150789589,0.00277378666215,0.0023280645255,0.00232525286265,0.00232525286265,0.00232268916443,0.00232268916443,0.00137639150489,0.00137487344909"

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,73586,"I came here for a quick/casual dinner with my mom, my sister, and her fiance on a Monday night at 8pm. They just moved to the area, so we were looking for somewhere local to eat. Everything was great; the service was attentive and very friendly, and the food was tasty, and it was not expensive. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back since I live in the EV. There are lots of places like this, so I would probably stay in my area and go somewhere similar. But if you are looking for a good quality, not expensive, casual vibe, local Italian spot in the Chelsea area this is a decent spot.RESTAURANT OVERVIEW:-It's quite large with lots of little rooms with tables. We ended up going through maybe 3 rooms to get to where we were seated. It was definitely busy with people, but not overly crowded.-The tables are kind of close to one another, which is common for NYC. -Dim-lit, rustic Italian vibe.-Come here if you are in the area - with friends or family. I don't think it's a place to ""impress"" - say, if you are taking someone out on a date. It's more a casual place for a good bite and a good price.APP:-Baked Goat Cheese, Tomato Sauce, with toasted bread: This was tasty! But it really just reminded me of when you are finished with your pasta and are dipping the bread into the remaining sauce. It's a dish of tomato sauce with goat cheese baked over it and then you dip the bread in. This was good, but I did feel that maybe it was missing something...something that would make it not feel like I was just scrapping away at the remaining pasta sauce from an entree.DINNER:-Ricotta and Spinach Tortelli, Brown Butter, Asparagus, Crispy Sage: This was good, definitely a big buttery taste, but overall very good. I don't think I could have a whole entree of this though because it tasted a bit heavy. I would maybe split this and something else with someone (if someone is willing to!)-Potato Gnocchi, Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil: This was alright - I really like anything with tomato sauce, mozz, and basil, but it did not WOW me. I think there could have been more sauce - it was a little bit too light for me in the sauce dept. Also the gnocchi pieces are very small unlike large gnocchi pieces I typically see.-Risotto (may have been a special): I did not taste this, but picture is included!DRINKS:-Cabernet Sav. Red Wine Bottle: Split this amongst the 4 of us. This is a good wine and good for the price.SERVICE:-Very nice and friendly.

Le Zie,5475,172 7th Ave,New York,10011.0,5258,"Located on 7th ave in chelsea. This small Italian eatery offered up some classic Italian dishes along with great service and atmosphere. The waiters are very attentive. Although I wonder if this is due to the fact that we were seated upstairs rather Than on the main floor. Bread with olive oil is served to the table. Along with your choice of sparkling or still water. We chose still. The server /waiter made sure that our glasses were full at all times. For appetizers we chose the calamari and a friend had the fetticini with mushrooms garlic & olive oil. We split this. It was delicious.They had a hefty choice of specials which are not listed on the menu. Entrees were linguini with clam sauce, penne with capers,black olives, & spicy tomato, lamb with vegetables & roasted potatoes, pork chops with vegetables with mashed potatoes. Desert followed dinner with an order of tiramisu and Eclairs ( they had some extravagant name)  which we split.

This time around I resisted ordering my recent ""usual"" - the lobster Benedict.   They added it to their lunch/brunch menu a while back and it's so incredibly good that I just keep ordering it, while chastising myself for not trying other things.  Yes, it's hard to resist perfection, and that's what the lobster Benedict is.  Thick chunks of lobster meat, perfectly done eggs, properly toasted muffin and the best little roasted and seasoned potatoes you've ever eaten. (I know, potatoes don't sound exciting, but these are amazing).Anyway, happy to report that I finally resisted my latest usual, and instead tried a new special that day, billed as tuna ravioli with ginger.  By the end of the meal, it had become the new favorite I'll have to avoid simply re-ordering (but truth be told, I can't wait to taste it again).  The ravioli were small and perfectly al dente. The tuna filling was combined with some other ingredients that I failed to inquire about - but whatever they were, it was delicious.  I sprinkled the dish with the side of light, crispy ginger and the flavor exploded.  I have never tasted anything similar to this!  Note that the dish stated a tomato sauce preparation, but I requested a light olive oil preparation instead.  (The chef is always quick to accommodate individual requests, which adds to the enjoyment of every meal.).  I hope they repeat this special, even if it keeps me, for a while at least, from experiencing the next great dish.",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.5,10.5,"one,favorites,brunch,lunch,dinner,menu,dish,food,prices,perfection,Le Zie,potatoes,lobster,anything,lunch/brunch menu,Benedict,lobster,things,requests,favorite,potatoes,tuna ravioli,ginger,meal,muffin,chunks,eggs,lobster meat,truth,end,chef,ginger,tomato sauce preparation,ingredients,dish,meal,flavor,enjoyment,ravioli,olive oil preparation,whatever,tuna filling,light,side","1,7,4,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0989056751132,0.0924381092191,0.0924381092191,0.0924381092191,0.0810948833823,0.0444243177772,0.0396474190056,0.0389152690768,0.0389152690768,0.0294638462365,0.0275815054774,0.02704625763,0.0186449568719,0.0171527992934,0.0169022269547,0.0159526150674,0.0153264217079,0.01479363814,0.0118642468005,0.0117590967566,0.0113623850048,0.0113402437419,0.0103788683191,0.0103613426909,0.00994320772588,0.00994320772588,0.00994320772588,0.00994320772588,0.0090669170022,0.0090669170022,0.00823927484453,0.00771253462881,0.00769623415545,0.00755385123193,0.00672386586666,0.00532490061596,0.00491623114794,0.00465894723311,0.00448420643806,0.00378524535336,0.00296439346857,0.00296439346857,0.00296081323177,0.00296081323177"

I recommend the back room or upstairs. I had the goat cheese appetizer which was outstanding if you like to dip your bread in something other than the olive oil( but that's good too because it has olives and garlic in it).For the main entree I ordered the Rigatoni veal with rosemary. That was a joke. I could have made it myself. Was very bland and the rosemary was a sprig on the side of the plate, not infused throughout the dish. What a disappointment.  The pasta noodles were large but it cost nothing to make pasta and the veal was like a sauce, literally.

Lady at the counter is super nice, she speaks English, Cantonese & Mandarin. The food is made w fresh ingredients & prepared right before ur eyes. No shady behind some high counter I don't know if u dropped my food on the floor kind of nonsense. Ordered the BLT Chopped Salad, Grilled Wild Salmon Salad, BLT Panini, Shrimp Wrap & a Mean Green Juice. The salmon was cooked perfectly! Everything was delicious, crisp, clean & oh so healthy.

That said, I like Leafage.  There are not many healthy options in my neighborhood, so I truly appreciate their menu offerings, which tend to be on the health-conscious side.  Their customer service does leave something to be desired, but in truth, Seamless has always handled any issue I've had with them by refunding my money (twice).  I am, however, concerned about the mislabelling of menu items reported by other Yelpers; thank you for sharing, it is good to know.Final story:  If you like healthy food, are not vegan, and do not suffer from food allergies, Leafage will probably satiate.  However, if you like to support small, local eateries, your conscious may have more of a problem digesting than your stomach does.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,5.90000009537,"brains,Leafage,business model,mind,kitchen,one,food,all,idea,options,business model,food trucks,more,ambiance,restaurant'' names,none,menu,lack,restaurants,menu offerings,mortar,brick,locations,transparency,application,costs,food,Seamless,sorts,Ratatouille,neighborhood,crainsnewyork.com/articl,story,menu items,mislabelling,something,more,food allergies,eateries,problem,stomach,Yelpers,side,money,truth,customer service,issue","7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,3,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7","0.18711976707,0.125718191266,0.0810061320662,0.0710533335805,0.0708411484957,0.0544716529548,0.0459559559822,0.0389015339315,0.0221220012754,0.0189160108566,0.0181091260165,0.0134982541203,0.0134724983945,0.0129957990721,0.0129121206701,0.0124314120039,0.0113328006119,0.0106559041888,0.00992538593709,0.00931813381612,0.00872257351875,0.00872257351875,0.00872257351875,0.0087024634704,0.0087024634704,0.0087024634704,0.00819115620106,0.00795872602612,0.00794884096831,0.00794884096831,0.00792358536273,0.00698593445122,0.00590608455241,0.00590608455241,0.00590608455241,0.00514391623437,0.00466922484338,0.00408974057063,0.00408523250371,0.00408523250371,0.00408523250371,0.00349705922417,0.00259767705575,0.00259420904331,0.00259420904331,0.00259420904331,0.00225644791499"

Lebanon,5481,28-28 Steinway St,Astoria,11103.0,2104,"Steinway is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to quality Middle Eastern food, more specifically Lebanese fare. After Beirut (yelp.com/biz/beirut-asto…) quietly closed last year, a new contender to the Astoria scene emerged with the simplest name of all: Lebanon. This is the real deal; Lebanese cuisine of 5 star caliber and the kind of place I wish was next door to me.At one point Lebanon was one of the better kept secret finds in the area, and by some standards, the rest of the borough. The secret is completely out; many folks are discovering this pseudo grocery store / take-out spot as a quality newcomer that has supplanted many of its nearby competition. There isn't enough seating here to consider this a restaurant beyond a takeout place, but the food is so good it really doesn't matter. There is some limited seating near the wall and some small tables for solo to two person dining. There is a counter / open kitchen where a lot of food is prepared. The rest of the place is more or less a grocery store, most of which is aimed toward Lebanese items.Food wise, I have been super impressed with their za'atar cheese bread, but only when it's fresh out of the even. The za'atar is a tasty spread on its own, but it's only so-so when it's room temperature. Impressively, their kibe is the size of a mini grenade, but is crunchy, delicious, and loaded with pine nuts. I saw a massive pile of their maqloobi, a staple of meat and basmati rice all meshed together and topped with toasted nuts. Their falafel and spinach pie are also very tasty. Finally, their mixed shawarma and grill could be a little heavier with the meats, but I still appreciated the flavor and tenderness of the meat nonetheless.They also offer delivery and take credit card. I'm really happy with the service, tasty food, and simple operation. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu.",5.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,9.10000038147,"deal,room temperature,food,embarrassment,seating,fare,riches,Steinway,Lebanese,contender,all,name,scene,kitchen,Astoria,Beirut,rest,place,one,cuisine,food,rest,restaurant,borough,star caliber,standards,kind,area,finds,food,seating,Food,grocery store,takeout place,secret,lot,folks,spot,grocery store,many,place,rest,competition,quality newcomer,solo,person dining,tables,wall,counter,most,za'atar cheese bread,meat,meats,shawarma,nuts,maqloobi,staple,basmati rice,spinach pie,grill,food,falafel,credit card,flavor,tenderness,meat nonetheless.,delivery,service,operation,menu,size,kibe,pine nuts,grenade,pile","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,1,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7","0.116326607764,0.0852407664061,0.0634577572346,0.0549529567361,0.0445415489376,0.0444453060627,0.0444453060627,0.0323493853211,0.0315915942192,0.030632417649,0.0242870096117,0.0212672557682,0.0212672557682,0.0129275992513,0.0126204360276,0.0126204360276,0.0109501257539,0.0101755438372,0.00986136868596,0.00967088527977,0.00955574400723,0.00894619431347,0.00844783894718,0.00810101348907,0.00810101348907,0.00810101348907,0.00810101348907,0.00810101348907,0.00810101348907,0.00777127826586,0.00758972438052,0.00710030319169,0.00700904475525,0.00682945316657,0.00667568296194,0.00662854965776,0.00659169210121,0.0063459938392,0.00622991332784,0.00622991332784,0.00621309969574,0.00569849694148,0.00545127317309,0.00545127317309,0.00542334839702,0.00542334839702,0.00542334839702,0.00542334839702,0.00541276903823,0.00494509842247,0.00494509842247,0.00462415302172,0.00461437599733,0.00449767196551,0.00420603295788,0.00368004082702,0.00368004082702,0.00368004082702,0.00367598468438,0.00367225753143,0.00364858936518,0.00345026166178,0.00296040787362,0.00274358130991,0.00254262262024,0.00254262262024,0.00254262262024,0.00254023470916,0.00254023470916,0.00253801373765,0.00200493284501,0.00197966932319,0.00184728659224,0.00161611498334,0.00161416269839"

We travel all over the 5 boroughs to try different ethnic foods. We traveled approximately 30 minutes to this food. Well worth the travel and time! We will return many more times. Terrific homemade food and the owners who are also the cooks were friendly and accommodating. It is a very casual place where you can order food and sit in the rear of the store to eat or do take out. We stayed to eat and tried a variety of food by ordering the vegetarian platter and the grilled platter. Everything was excellent and delicious!! Next time we will try the daily specials and salads.

Lee Good Taste,5485,2686 Pitkin Ave,Brooklyn,11208.0,11097,"Listen,... I am speaking the truth,...This place, in a merchant section of Pitkin Ave, in Brooklyn,.. is a GEM!The reasons being;Firstly,.. IT'S OPEN TO MIDNIGHT! I came here at 11:45pm to get food because my wife and I were having an impulsive craving late at night after eating a light early dinner. I saw it on Yelp and said, ""What the heck..""Second: The family who own this place are ADORABLE! I walk in a quarter to 12am at night and an approximately  10yr old boy with his about 14 yr old brother are earnestly running the front counter and rushing around, getting my order together. The very pleasant mom was frying something and the father was cooking with the woks. You could really see the hard honest work that this immigrant family puts in in their final minutes before closing. I mean these young kids of theirs are working hard for and with their parents to almost midnight and they seemed excited that they were taking care of the front counter. It was really a charming experience believe it or not. Third: The food was EXCELLENT! The wontons were fried lightly like I always liked and the rest was fresh and tasted great!Fourth: The Price! This place is noticeably more affordable then any Chinese food spot I've been to in years! I was very happy with the menu prices. Any two of these four points would bring me back to this place so I consider this place a true hidden Gem.

I arrived there 40 minutes later and it was all on the counter ready to go. The kid behind the counter said ""Let me help you to your car."" As we got to my car and put the boxes in, the owner Joe was right behind me in the parking lot with a complimentary bottle of red and a bottle of white and he said ""Thanks for coming!"" You know how you pick up food from a restaurant and you get it home and stuff is missing or wrong....well everything was there. When we opened it, it was all still hot and perfect.  The free bruschetta for the table is delicious. The portions are big, everything is fresh and tasty.

Tip:  If you go for the clam sauce, choose white over red if you want to taste the clams.Veggies are likewise cooked to extinction.  Overdone to the point of flavorless disentergration.When busy (which is pretty much always), Service can be extremely slow for course service, but feel brisk to get you out the door at the final stages of your meal.Bottom line:  Good quality fish and meat absolutely destroyed by what is around it and disappointing service.  Prices are average for the area.  Parking can be tight.  Recommend street parking on the Southbound side of the Boulevard (across the street).",2.0 star rating,"Trumbull, CT",2,1,0.300000011921,9.30000019073,"experience,distance,times,Lenny,place,meal,crowd,disentergration.,carnivore,wine,place,place,outcome,fish places,Fish,Pros,meal,plate,Service,Sauce,point,steak,table,visitor,votePortions,fish,deal,Sweetness,Yelper,course service,Cons:Pasta,stages,line,door,Parking,House,service,Italian,street,street parking,meat,average,area,side,Boulevard,Prices,clam sauce,point,seafood,Tip,Veggies,extinction","7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.264802992344,0.0738181769848,0.0738181769848,0.0717221647501,0.0578743740916,0.0444575101137,0.0350611545146,0.026449713856,0.0229224842042,0.0203445423394,0.0203157253563,0.0180999618024,0.013423204422,0.0121965026483,0.0113507229835,0.0110641829669,0.0103157358244,0.0100646745414,0.0094183050096,0.00939313787967,0.00939313787967,0.00902331341058,0.00899052340537,0.00892313569784,0.00845874100924,0.00829873792827,0.00821225252002,0.00820508413017,0.00794061087072,0.00769178522751,0.00652241241187,0.00612236233428,0.00612236233428,0.00612236233428,0.00592634407803,0.00533177377656,0.00532752135769,0.00532589992508,0.00483587477356,0.00426032673568,0.00423988280818,0.00423681270331,0.00423681270331,0.00423115910962,0.00423115910962,0.00397667009383,0.00307290046476,0.00307053956203,0.00269066286273,0.00268846214749,0.00268846214749,0.00268846214749"

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,10017,"First things first: The sauce here is *legit*. The real dang thing. In a region where Italian restaurants are ubiquitous, what you need to know is that Lenny's is a casual, local family joint. Think: old school. No bells nor whistles. The kind of place that has been there my entire life. The kind of place that you go on family reunions and special occasions. I used to come here in the 80s when my cousin worked here. His mom held his graduation party here and I believe there were at least a few other family events in the upstairs private room. When I stepped inside yesterday, I felt like it hasn't changed at all! It's a good feeling. Yesterday's occasion was a sad one. My beloved Uncle, who lived right across the bay, passed away last week at the ripe old age of 92. His family arranged for his post-funeral lunch in the private room in the back and it was just perfect. When I say that it feels like it hasn't changed it all, that's not quite true. They've added on this really cool room with HUGE windows that looks out on the bay. We could see the house that my uncle built from these windows. You also get an amazing view of planes taking off from JFK.My parents make fun of my so-called ""difficult"" and ""snobby"" taste these days. I've changed from the ""I'll only eat ravioli or lasagne"" 12 year old girl, let's just say and they'll never let me forget it. ""Refined."" Let's go with more ""refined"" tastes. And vegan (yeah, I know, difficult). When placing my order, I wasn't expecting our waitress to get the whole ""no dairy or meat"" thing, but she was awesome. The pasta course that was set to come out had a house marinara sauce that contained shredded pork, so she made sure to bring me plain marinara. As I've said before, it is absolutely delicious and brings me back to my childhood love of basic Italian food (which, despite my so-called ""snobby"" tastes, I still adore). Pasta is served al dente. As it should be (otherwise, go to the Olive Garden). Other things that are excellent here: bruschetta and green salad... *Good* Italian bread is brought out to your table. Although our waitress offered up a dairy-free eggplant dish, I opted for a plate of veggies that came out perfectly seasoned with garlic and a little olive oil.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,453,"My husband and his family have been coming to Lenny's for the past 10 years . He always raved about the food and started taking me the last few years. The food was still very delicious but in recent months the service and the quality of food has certainly went down hill. In particular the last two times the chicken has been tough and old and I'm no picky eater. Our waitress are always getting our orders wrong and this last occasion there was hair in one dish and the chicken Francese was inedible. It was so disgusting that when I chewed it the chicken was so tough and nauseating,  we had to bring it up to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen. At this point I only wanted to eat the pasta and not the chicken. The time came to pay the bill and as we reviewed our bill we were charged for several beers and cocktails that we did not order.. Again, we brought it to the attention of the waitress and she took it to the manager to get it rectified. And then we got our bill again and still were charged for two beers that no one ordered! At this point we went directly to the manager since he never showed his face to the table  in the earlier incidents which was truly unprofessional. He ended up fixing the situation but how can after years of going to this restaurant and enjoying the service come down to an unpleasant visit?

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,58734,"I dined here with another Meetup group on Saturday, 6/25.Lenny's has been doling out clams and other items since 1974.Driving on Crossbay Boulevard is a PITA.The traffic would not allow me to access the valet parking line so I was resigned to parking on the street and feeding one of Mr. Di Blasio's hideous parking meters. Thankfully, two bucks sufficed as the need to feed terminated at 7:00 p.m and I could enjoy my dining experience without running out of the restaurant. Why do people in Queens put up with this crap and not demand more (free) municipal parking?Lenny's is a large brightly lit restaurant which was crowded at 5:00 p.m. when I arrived. Our waitress was very nice and she took the good natured ""kidding around"" of our dinner host with amiable cheer. She was attentive and gave us good service. She took our drink orders quickly and I enjoyed a fresh, crisp and cold Sam Adams with my dinner.I started with Baked Little Neck Clams, six to an order. They were tender, well seasoned and tasty. I would certainly order them again. Three others ordered the clams and liked them. One member opined that the BBQed Ribs appetizer was merely OK. Two others were less fortunate. One ordered the Shrimp Cocktail ($12.95) for three small measly shrimp, which I photographed. Another ordered the French Onion Soup, which was both meh and in a very small bowl. The complimentary salads, which each diner received, were good, however.On to the mains: I ordered the Prime Rib ""Steak Special"" ($32.95). Although it came medium rare as requested, it also had fried onions and a weird brown gravy on top of it. As to the former, it would have been nice to see something green on the plate instead for 33 bucks. As to the latter, putting brown gravy on any type of steak raises issues of freshness, whether justified or not.My steak tasted fine, but I would have preferred it bare or with a light Au Jus.Other entrees my fellow diners enjoyed were the the BBQ Platter, the Fisherman's Platter and the Lenny's Special(breaded Lobster Tail with assorted Seafood). All of these entrees were portioned skimpily. For instance, the Lenny's Special had two clams and two shrimp. One diner's Lasagne was drowning in tomato sauce.Dessert is a real highlight at Lenny's. It was, frankly, hard to choose between the many tempting options. I chose the Apple Crisp ""Shake"" which combined Apple Crumb Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Whipped Cream in a beer mug. It was awesome. One diner said that his Tartuffo was exceptional.FINAL TAKE: Lenny's does certain menu items very well but I would have expected more from a restaurant with more than 40 years of experience.",3.0 star rating,"Massapequa Park, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,11.6999998093,"25.Lenny,Di Blasio,traffic,clams,parking,one,PITA.,items,waitress,group,valet parking line,street,parking meters,restaurant,Crossbay Boulevard,Meetup,French Onion Soup,entrees,clams,shrimp,brown gravy,Steak Special,parking,restaurant,dining experience,people,need,crap,diner,Apple Crisp ``Shake,Clams,drink orders,diner,appetizer,order,dinner.,others,Another,onions,salads,dinner host,cheer,service,member,clams,diner,bowl,mains,top,former,Queens,brown gravy,shrimp,highlight,Seafood,Lobster Tail,All,instance,Dessert,tomato,Au Jus.,Lenny's Special,Baked Little Neck,BBQed Ribs,Shrimp Cocktail,Sam Adams,restaurant,diners,experience,menu items,Fisherman's Platter,others,options,beer mug,Lasagne,plate,steak,steak,Tartuffo,Vanilla Ice Cream,something,freshness,issues,latter,type,Whipped Cream,not.My,Apple Crumb Pie,BBQ Platter","1,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,7,2,7,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,2,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,4,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,1,2,1,7,7,6,1,7,6,7,6,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,6","0.103145770729,0.075161382556,0.0671581700444,0.045552585274,0.045552585274,0.045552585274,0.0418275855482,0.038579467684,0.0379479303956,0.0338040031493,0.0338040031493,0.0338040031493,0.0338040031493,0.0242994204164,0.0200963914394,0.0200963914394,0.0148918973282,0.0148891098797,0.0144367795438,0.0130345933139,0.010824254714,0.0105318157002,0.00830831099302,0.00775989098474,0.00697014201432,0.0066303643398,0.00617694482207,0.00614531198516,0.00611035106704,0.00587609037757,0.00556239625439,0.00520247220993,0.00503610167652,0.00487990770489,0.00470107467845,0.00470107467845,0.00467698834836,0.00465524988249,0.00425243936479,0.00421660998836,0.0041344682686,0.0041344682686,0.00412279414013,0.00408674171194,0.00374845881015,0.00374602293596,0.00372742302716,0.00372392381541,0.00372066930868,0.00371762737632,0.00363947171718,0.00354673154652,0.00348272919655,0.00343568157405,0.00277537899092,0.00277537899092,0.00277336873114,0.00277146836743,0.00276966672391,0.00276966672391,0.00274355779402,0.00248109526001,0.00243535009213,0.00241962820292,0.00241404143162,0.00240466790274,0.00240424228832,0.00231881556101,0.00218670954928,0.00218670954928,0.00206475076266,0.00202087429352,0.00191633577924,0.0019152056193,0.00163953367155,0.00153092260007,0.001529745874,0.001529745874,0.00135237234645,0.00129577133339,0.00126534933224,0.00121716968715,0.00121716968715,0.00121716968715,0.00121716968715,0.00113359314855,0.000720362761058,0.000571424141526,0.000391925306758"

When my salad came out, it was drenched in dressing which appeared to just be honey mustard strait from a jar (not the vinegrette is was said to be) and the waitress' finger in it. Finally the entre - the linguine with shrimp had 4 very overcooked shrimp in it and a very thin alfredo sauce while the fried clams were rubbery and low in quantity.

I wasnt expecting that but i was a tad put off when i asked if she can try to give us a table at a corner or something bcuz we had a handicap with us. But nothing major that needed to be addressed.

The bruschetta served alongside their bread basket is great. Their baked clams are so good. Their raw oysters and fried calamari are also yummy. And in the month of January, they have specials on their baked clams, calamari, linguine over red/white clam sauce (and others, which I can not remember) for $5.95. Mention ""Joe"" and you'll get a complimentary glass of house red or white wine.I always order the scallops, which are always sweet, plump and juicy, whether broiled or fried.

We ordered the baked clams (only 1/2 dozen, wish we ordered the full dozen!) and they were amazing. Next, had the salad that came with my meal - house salad with creamy Italian dressing was so good. Ordered the broiled salmon with vegetable and it was AMAZING. I had to save room for dessert though! If you go to Lenny's, order the cherry cheesecake - I wanted to lick the plate. Forgot our waitresses name, but she was a bit older with reddish brown curly hair. She joked around with us the whole night and was always around to help us. It could be a bit pricey.

Couldn't wait to get my old time favorites,  but the great extensive menu, had our mouths watering. We started out with some white wine, and bruscetta, then we shared baked clams, stuffed shrimp, linguine with white clam sauce and of course, the fried calamari. What's great about the calamari is you can get it with mild, medium, or hot sauce on the side (I like plenty of lemon too) this way everybody gets the sauce they want. The calamari was tender, the stuffed shrimp and fried clams were deliciouso, and the linguine with clam sauce was great as usual, and rounded out the meal.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,23866,"This is my first review and my first time at Lenny's in Howard Beach. I wanted to thank Lenny's for salvaging what, up until that point, had been a legendarily crappy day. Our group of four sat outside and were given a table right next to the water with a great view of the boats in the channel. Something about having real water at your feet when you dine is nice, especially in Queens. Our server was a rather young fellow from the neighborhood (I assume) who was friendly and engaging. He quickly picked up that our group was happy to joke around all night and he made us laugh all night. In addition, every order was exactly correct and when we requested something he took care of our needs fast. When we were eating and chatting he would check in but not overly often. Top notch from the young man.Our food was excellent. They were out of piss clams (damn) so we did the baked clams which were excellent. My dish of lobster tail fra diavalo was spicy, fresh, well cooked, and plentiful. My friend's breaded sole was light and tasty. Other dishes got high marks from the table.Maybe it was just the incongruity of sitting on the waterfront watching the moon rise over the boats in the channel while still being in Queens that made the atmosphere immediately captivating, but whatever it was nothing ruined our evening and everything was exceptional.",5.0 star rating,"Woodside, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.90000009537,"review,time,Lenny,Howard Beach,point,fellow,Something,water,waterfront,boats,channel,group,view,group,water,table,server,order,food,Queens,care,feet,neighborhood,addition,dishes,needs,notch,sole,table.,incongruity,friend,moon rise,everything,boats,channel,something,atmosphere,whatever,dish,clams,piss clams,lobster tail fra diavalo","5,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,3,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.325893580914,0.0894212424755,0.0677367374301,0.0533985681832,0.0429634749889,0.0297928228974,0.0228517539799,0.0205966550857,0.018935199827,0.0187404155731,0.0187404155731,0.0187404155731,0.0164035502821,0.0149859357625,0.0138709926978,0.013322214596,0.0131459850818,0.0130901606753,0.0119428792968,0.0117168826982,0.0111050419509,0.0110433297232,0.0110121909529,0.0109654031694,0.010954731144,0.0100357532501,0.0100038805977,0.00889419205487,0.00850456114858,0.00792817398906,0.00744924601167,0.00631181802601,0.00615389458835,0.00589010305703,0.00589010305703,0.00564310280606,0.00515356380492,0.00515356380492,0.00446643307805,0.00413413532078,0.00374466995709,0.00327223492786"

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,41550,"If you've read my profile, you would have seen that Chicken Francese is my option for my last meal. It's also the one thing I would take to a deserted island and the first thing I would grab in case of fire. I love it that much.I've been wanting to go to Lenny's forever, but my boyfriend S staunchly will not eat anything seafood and the mere name of the place makes him wrinkle his nose and as a result I've waited almost 3 years to try this place. Saturday, after some holiday baking shopping I was on my own and decided to have some quick dinner. I honestly don't mind dining alone, I find it relaxing (particularly over a good book) and time spent with some quality company. I felt a little left out though because this place was absolutely jumping, even at 9 when I walked in after the usual dinner rush has cleared out. I decided to sit at the bar and order the CF. Considering how busy it was, the wait was a mere 20 minutes from ordering to salad to entree. This may have just been the best one I've had out. The chicken was tender and was pounded so thin it nearly fell apart in your mouth. The sauce, which is the crucial factor, was the perfect blend of white wine, lemon, butter, and parsley. You know it's worthy of 5 stars when you are incredibly full and you try to keep eating because it's just so darn good. That may just be the most gluttonous statement I've ever typed in my life, but it's true. The only thing that could've made this dinner better was if it was June and I could sit outside at one of the tables near the dock overlooking the water.Paired with a glass of Pinot and a chopped salad and some garlic bread, this was the perfect end to my evening.

Not as impressive; most of it was really bad.  They immediately started us out with a small dish of bruschetta, which wasn't too bad.  The stale bread and breadsticks were another story.Anyway, we ordered baked clams, linguine with white clam sauce and a combination calamari/scungilli dish with medium sauce.  The baked clams were the highlight of the lunch, as they were well-seasoned.  I even dunked the stale bread in the garlic and oil juices.Then it all went downhill.  The fried calamari was barely battered, hardly fried, and more chewy than rubber.  The batter, that actually slid off, was white, gooey and very under cooked.  The scungilli was nothing more than canned scungilli. I expected fresh scungilli, like they serve at in Sheepshead Bay, which, by the way, is 100 times better than this crappy joint.  As for the sauce, it was terrible; it had an off, stale taste. It certainly wasn't fresh.The linguine with white clam sauce was awful.  Terrible.  Pathetic. The name of this place is Lenny's CLAM Bar, so you'd think they'd get that part right.  The clams were tiny and only a few, almost like baby clams you get in a can. They tasted tinny like canned clams do as well and not freshly shucked.  The sauce was also terrible and tasted nothing like clam juice; it was somewhat sour.  They should be embarrassed to serve such crap.Bottom line is that this place obviously doesn't care about quality.  It was rather empty for lunch, and I'm guessing that not too many Italians come here, unless they are clueless and don't know what good Italian food is.  Needless to say, I'll never frequent this place again.  One star for the terrible food, another star for the decent service.",2.0 star rating,"Middletown, CT",2,1,-0.5,16.5,"story.,lunch,co-worker,scungilli,time.So,dish,sauce,Sheepshead Bay,Lenny,batter,clams,server,food,breadsticks,Italians,most,scungilli,bruschetta,sauce,clam sauce,scungilli,scungilli,sauce,clam sauce,lunch,linguine,nothing,CLAM Bar,combination calamari,linguine,fried calamari,highlight,oil,garlic,rubber,way,joint,taste,lunch,nothing,clam juice,food,Bottom line,quality,place,food,place,service,star,star,baby clams,clams,part,place,name,can,few,Italian,clams","6,4,1,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,6,7,2,6,6,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7","0.106984898448,0.0928074494004,0.0861092656851,0.0578414686024,0.0553783848882,0.0407262966037,0.0317324511707,0.0307856909931,0.0295347813517,0.0273218564689,0.0185948330909,0.0185534805059,0.0169984102249,0.0168501101434,0.0162504259497,0.0160970371217,0.0145136034116,0.0134468125179,0.0130086401477,0.0130086401477,0.0122512783855,0.0121576627716,0.0117899607867,0.0117789078504,0.0113617461175,0.0111943176016,0.0109478458762,0.0106037678197,0.0103555172682,0.0103555172682,0.0103024961427,0.0090438388288,0.00902855861932,0.00902855861932,0.00901510193944,0.0082202674821,0.0082202674821,0.00821193773299,0.00765889044851,0.00697489175946,0.00697489175946,0.00649586739019,0.00641608471051,0.00609898241237,0.00530071277171,0.00529785407707,0.00485626934096,0.00481866579503,0.00481866579503,0.00481866579503,0.00455674529076,0.00455362303182,0.00345692667179,0.00337129761465,0.00328596890904,0.00268061342649,0.00268061342649,0.00249839085154,0.00197329279035"

The service team also is top notch, knowledgable in cuisine, and treating their guests special! The food was excellent! Starting with lobster bisque soup with chunks of lobster meat, and French onion soup with a great beefy stock and gooey delicious cheese. This is only the beginning of this feast! We dined on their famous calamari Calabrese, baked clams, shrimp scampi over rice, the Captain's Platter, linguini with Scungilli  and clams in a garlicky butter sauce,  baby back ribs, roasted potatoes and asparagus, mozzarella Caprese, and the special of the day which was amazing rigatoni with tiger shrimps, crab meat, sundried tomatoes, broccoli rabe in a roasted garlic cream Demi! We could not even look at the dessert menu at this point but were told their desserts are exceptional as well! Lenny's has a rich history and are celebrating their anniversary this year, this venue opened in 1974.  The icon has become a tradition in Howard Beach with a line out the door for dinner on the weekends!

So why am I giving it one star when I have been here so many times? Management and the ""valet parking""(it's just a small lot that can fit 4 or 5 cars). I went into the valet parking and the minute I got out, one of the attendants came up to me and the first thing out of his mouth was ""We appreciate anything $10 or more. Would you like to pay now or later"".Let me make it clear, there is no fee for parking. He was saying give him a $10 or more tip... I told him that I would pay later. I came out after dinner, and gave another attendant my ticket. The original one came up and without saying a word stuck out his hand for a tip! I gave him a $7 tip, which I thought was pretty generous, and he took the money, saw how much it was, rolled his eyes and then walked away without a word(no thank you or have a nice day).Okay okay, so I wouldn't give them a one star solely on atrocious valet. I am giving them one star because I politely emailed management alerting them of what the valet is doing(I thought they just might not know). It's been a week and still no response back. I also tried calling management two times but each time I tried to explain why im calling they just put me on hold and then drop me.(Maybe bad connection or maybe they are dropping me on purpose, who knows).I have been here a good handful of times and was going to make this my go-to restaurant but not anymore.",1.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,-0.20000000298,5.59999990463,"handful,food,star,one,one,attendants,valet parking,Management,lot,tip,valet,valet parking,thing,cars,parking,tip,fee,more,attendant,word,hand,anything,word,money,mouth,dinner,ticket,times,eyes,tip,management,im,hold,times,response,restaurant,purpose,connection,me.,management,star","7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7","0.72806429863,0.0773341879249,0.0221134889871,0.0185095667839,0.0171212013811,0.0156750567257,0.012658524327,0.012658524327,0.0098169464618,0.00751719204709,0.00556389894336,0.00483872415498,0.00459887553006,0.00386672257446,0.00326002505608,0.00323586398736,0.00317766400985,0.00297393742949,0.00294795702212,0.00294356490485,0.00294356490485,0.00280775758438,0.00269033503719,0.00260511762463,0.00260235765018,0.00257961661555,0.00257961661555,0.0023709142115,0.00235412269831,0.00231077731587,0.00220294017345,0.00175325921737,0.00175325921737,0.00164194626268,0.00141489005182,0.00121401145589,0.00121401145589,0.00121401145589,0.00121401145589,0.000968625303358,0.000688634056132"

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,197114,"My family and I have been coming to Lenny's for over 30 years. We have always had great food and great service. My husband wanted to come here for his bday dinner, and my 8 yr old really wanted to try the lobster tail; we have been telling him how perfectly cooked it was... Well, the service was wonderful, that is why there are 3 stars. Our waiter was a joy and even showed our son his fidget toy; they had the same one. The baked clams were good... I ordered the lobster fra diavlo, it was good but not as spicy as I'm used to from Lenny's, and it was more like 1/2 of a small lobster tail... My husband ordered his usual; a large shrimp with medium marinara and waffle fries. There were a total of 10 small to medium count shrimp (that's being generous with the size), and the water biscuit on the plate. For $20, there should be a bit more shrimp, and placed in the basket like they used to do. The waffle fries were good, but again for the price there should have been a bit more. Now the lobster tails; stuffed and baked. We got the twin so we can share one while the Boy ate the other. They were NOT baked well, and not even a bit crunchy on top like they used to be. The breading was mushy and the lobster much too soft and mushy as well. It also came DROWNED in butter with additional butter on the side. It was more like overcooked lobster scampi; almost $33 bucks. We ended up ordering him a small bowl of linguine with marinara. We took most of it home, but honestly probably going to toss. Also, why was there lettuce and tomato as a garnish on the plate; it's not a burger deluxe... So, hubby is sulky because his bday dinner was a bust; kid was upset because he really wanted to like the lobster but was overdone and drowning in scampi sauce (still not sure why). For spending over $150.00 ( that's with tip - we tipped the server a bit over 20% (again he was excellent)), my family should have had a much better experience. This is NOT the Lenny's I know and grew up with; unfortunately we are so disappointed that it will be a very long time until we come back again.

The location isn't bad and the size of the place is very large. It's a down to earth kinda place which gives it a really good atmosphere. The problem to start out is the parking is a bit difficult, however, they do offer complimentary valet parking. The service was spotty for the most part, but the true testament to the restaurant is in the food. We had a few appetizers to start with and that set the bar very high. They were all great. We started with the rice balls, fried zucchini and calamari. All were nicely done, not over fried, not undercooked and perfectly seasoned. Then came the standard pasta course followed by the entrees, which sadly were a let down. I personally went with the crab stuffed sole which was ok, but rather on the bland side. Those around me went with the other options and no one was overly wow'ed. Then came the desert and all was saved with the fantastic cake.Overall, the food is decent, the service is mediocre and the atmosphere is relaxing.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,43307,"PROS- The Bruschetta, atmoshphereCONS- Parasite in with the Oysters, Food portions, Food not fresh, Rude management, poorly cooked calamari, lame attempt at sangria.This is an compilation of 3 or 4 attempts at trying this place out with friends. The atmosphere is nice. I like the choice of tile for flooring, the mural on the wall and the black raw iron railing separating the ground level from the slightly elevated ground level.  They serve bruschetta  immediately which is absolutely delicious with fresh crisp tomatoes. That's were it stops. 2 times the calamari was served like rubber. I took a date here one of those times, got rubber calamari, sent it back for a new batch and it came back just as rubbery. (she was covering her mouth as she tried to chew herself to death) Ordered a ""20 oz bone in Black Angus"" Rib Eye which I'd be speaking generous if I were to say it was 14oz and over cooked. They put Orange Juice in their sangria, so it's not really sangria, it's wine punch. Another time I came with a few couples, the place was crowded so they sat us in the back room (which is their overflow area) We ordered raw oysters and luckily my friend saw a parasite doing the backstroke in the ice water before the ladies did. I quickly covered the wiggly guy with a wedge of lemon before he was discovered and screams/vomiting was ensued (Clean your freakin shellfish before serving !). We then ordered their snow crab legs. I believe there were six  halves served on each plate. On my plate 3 were fresh and delicious, the other 3 were slightly grey and had that texture and taste of being frozen. toward the end of our meal, since the front room was no longer crowded and we were the last table occupied in the back room, they started to clean up the back room and shut it down. Apparently annoyed with us, the manager that night (a short grumpy looking white haired man) stood in the doorway of that back room and glared at us like a warden as if we were an inconvenience holding up the closing of the back room. (even though we were spending $300 plus that night there). Wish I would have come here back in the 80s when it was suppose to have been good. I think people just like to come here to feel like goodfellas (which is a joke, because goodfellas don't eat at bad restaurants) or just because the photos in the front with celebrities coming here (again back in the 80s when it was good) giving an illusion that it's a place stars would eat at.   As an Italian American, there is not one dish on this menu that I can't stop off at the supermarket, spend a couple bucks and cook 10 times if not 20 times better than the junk they're serving you.

While the atmosphere is very family-like and the most appreciative element about the lunch was the fact that we weren't rushed. We were allowed to sit as long as we liked and that was a great plus. However, the food was disappointing. I ordered the linguini with white clam sauce. The pasta was cooked beautifully and the sauce was delicious. However, the clams used for this dish were the huge chowder clams, were extremely rubbery (which is why they are used for chowders), and when chopped are ugly to look at. To try to offset this disaster, a few Little Neck clams were placed on top of the linguini, however, it didn't fool me. This kitchen should not try to fool its clients who know that the smaller clams, such as vongole & Little Necks are what's used for this dish. Ugh! Never will go again.

Love the framed pix of all the celebrities and their autographs of who's dined here at Lenny's. Service is ok. Nothing to write home about. I'm not gonna rip the service apart because they are spread too thin. My waitress had half the dining room & 1 other guy had the other half. Too many tables to tend to at once. After taking our order she came back a few minutes later and asked us what we ordered again just to make sure she got the order correct. Really? Next time write it down - don't try to memorize it. Food- I will say it's good. I wasn't ""WOWed"" but It's not terrible. After receiving the wrong order (which I didn't fuss about - I'm easy) , I enjoyed it. The spicy marinara sauce had a nice flavor and kick to it meanwhile the scungilli left a lot to be desired. The baked clams  & the chicken francese were delicious.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,8803,"Food is fantastic, especially the lobster bisque. What truly wowed me about this place most recently (like, my jaw was on the floor) was the service...My friends and I order there regularly-- one of our favorite things to share is the steamed calamari with linguine & marinara. Unfortunately though, one of us has a shellfish allergy, but still loves the linguine-- so we always order the calamari on the side (i.e. a container of linguine and a separate container of calamari). Usually something gets lost in translation and it all comes together in the same container, and my friend can't have any :-( Normally we just let it go, but it happened again recently for probably the 4th or 5th time and it was the crux of my friend's meal, so we called the restaurant just beseeching them to follow through with special orders regarding allergies......first they offered to drive back the 30 min to bring us the correct order.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,11558,"So I came here the other night with a craving for seafood and Italian.  I've been here once before and really didn't think it was so great, but whilst searching my requirements via Yelp and looking near to home (I live in Howard Beach) I figured I'd give Lenny's Clam Bar another shot. I came with my BF and his brother.  We started with fried calamari and mozzerella sticks.  The calamari was nothing special and I asked for the sauce to be spicy and it resembed pizza sauce with something spicey.  But it certainly had a very dark, tomatoe pastey look. Not very appetizing.On to entrees. I had the linguine and white clam sauce. It was decent, nothing spectacular, but my brother in law ordered Penne a la Vodka... which came out looking more like Penne in cream of tomato soup. It was SOOOO watery!  He sent it back to ask if they could thicken it up which they did, but he still said it wasn't really that good.My BF ordered the chicken oregenata which came with a salad.  He asked for the balsamic vinegarette (sp?) however it was DROWNED in the dressing.  If a salad is dressed right, especially with a vinegarette, you shouldn't have much if any left on the plate. He had alot of balsamic still on the plate after eating the salad.  So, not only did it look sloppy coming out, it was over dressed.His chicken came with a side which he had linguine w/ olive and garlic.  The end result? like 1/2 inch of olive oil at the bottom of the pasta bowl.  I mean that seems a bit excessive.I'm not Italian, but I think I've eaten at enough Italian restaurants to know that this is certainly not remotely close to any of the best Italian I've had.  New Park Pizza is way tastier (and that's just bread, sauce and cheese).  I think La Villa is a better choice if you're in the neighborhood of Howard Beach.  It's nicer and the food is decent.

So why the 2 stars? Man, was the service super cold and curt. I've experienced rude service. This wasn't it. This was more cold, and it had me feeling like I didn't belong here. Why did I feel this way? As a brown person of color with a white girl friend in an old school Italian type place, in a room filled with other Italian and white patrons, it was easy to see the difference between how our table was treated and other tables were. I'm not saying that every server in this establishment looks at a table that isn't white and thinks ""man they either won't tip well or this is going to suck"" but this expierence definitely had me thinking about race instead of the food. Read my yelps. I generally don't comment unless the service is super bad. Rather I leave positive reviews because I understand the effects of a bad review on a business. But this place made my expierence really awkward. The guy literally tossed the check at me when I asked for it.

I've been coming here for years, and there has always been a hint of how racists they are, but last night was the peak ... we ordered our food, and not once after that did we see our waiter once, or see if we needed anything, which we did.  After we finished eating the busboy cleared our table and we sat there like a pair of assholes because our waiter not only never came by but just seemed to vanish, after about 10 minutes of just sitting there we finally had to ask a different waitress to find out waiter, and he comes over like a total douche bag and expects a tip.  Never once have I ever been treated like this in a restaurant.  WOW.  I am not the first or only person to notice how racist the wait staff is here... and I am appalled.  That in this day and age, in NYC of all places someone like me, who doesn't even look Indian can be treated with such racism.

See the photo I included. After we began ordering the waiter informed us that they decided to end it yesterday.  Why advertise on the radio till march 1st than and mislead the customers .

(it is if you're nitpicking. i really wanted to eat some of his fried clam strips though.)the heat from the lumpy, maroon sauce that coated my mussels was accompanied by an overwhelming blast of sweetness not unlike marinara sauce. my nose ran and my eyes watered and i reached for bread because i left my Milky Ways at the beach.of all of the mussels i received i only crunched down on one nut. they weren't bubblegum chewy, and there weren't any dead gross ones splaying their webby guts across an open shell like what happened when i took jenna to white cap that time.the platter's center was the only part that was completely blanketed with the velvet sauce. with common oversight i saved core for last, believing it to be the monster mussel of the batch and instead sadly discovering a soggy piece of day old italian bread. very, very tricky. next time we ditch work for a spontaneous flaneur we'll try the other clam bar three blocks past Lenny's Clam Bar on the way towards Howard Beach.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,7.30000019073,"clam bar,Clam Bar,waitress,establishment,Lenny,buffet,box,bagels,dauntless,Beach 90,Burger King,Popeye,Chinese,Crossbay Blvd,Jonas,master shot,menu,copy,anomaly,TV show,waitress,Chaucer,part,cap,menus,basket,hint,veins,voice,nodules,hostess,pile,direction,eardrums,blood,amounts,necks,mussels,sauce,first,mussels,waiters,bread,place,sauce,craving,order,cravings,impoliteness,jonas,order,clam strips,hearing,dining room,friends,clan,air,characters,location,video,set,inhabitants,half,doc,lobster bisque,clam chowder,mussels,cost,promise,filet,cuttlefish,bite,wrongness,roles,Canterbury Tales,beach.,bread,monster mussel,blocks,ones,mollusk,nut,all,platter,guts,chewy,shell,center,Italian,clam bar,velvet sauce,Hurricane Sandy,Sopranos,History Channel,Rockaway,Long Island,nose,bread,oversight,core,batch,piece,work,flaneur,way,mussels,marinara sauce,act,Milky Ways,Howard Beach,clam strips,sweetness,blast,heat,some,eyes","7,2,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,2,3,1,2,2,1,5,7,7,7,5,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,1,1,7,1,2,5,7,1,1,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,4,5,3,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7","0.0636521801353,0.0498201176524,0.0386870913208,0.0386076197028,0.0366035476327,0.0362544879317,0.0362544879317,0.0362544879317,0.0362544879317,0.027024211362,0.0241176318377,0.0215280056,0.0215280056,0.0215280056,0.0208701901138,0.0203935690224,0.0197564773262,0.0172044970095,0.0172044970095,0.0144675495103,0.0128017514944,0.0101973554119,0.00807962566614,0.00758382305503,0.00751470867544,0.00737113552168,0.00674400106072,0.00663487426937,0.00657526683062,0.00657526683062,0.00657526683062,0.00657526683062,0.00655134487897,0.00655134487897,0.00655134487897,0.00655134487897,0.00655134487897,0.00630734954029,0.00593965919688,0.0058341100812,0.00576224224642,0.00552943861112,0.00550931692123,0.00538956327364,0.00518427696079,0.00501954928041,0.00501954928041,0.00501106167212,0.00477247359231,0.00458561861888,0.00457877805457,0.00457877805457,0.00442297756672,0.0044104848057,0.0044104848057,0.0044104848057,0.0044104848057,0.0044104848057,0.0044104848057,0.00440030358732,0.00440030358732,0.00440030358732,0.00440030358732,0.00440030358732,0.00439171399921,0.00439171399921,0.00427878368646,0.00401200726628,0.00401200726628,0.00401200726628,0.00401200726628,0.00400602119043,0.00400602119043,0.00400067400187,0.00389327551238,0.00374352000654,0.00374352000654,0.00362208834849,0.00341302924789,0.00328562455252,0.00316467648372,0.00297882128507,0.00297882128507,0.00297602335922,0.00297602335922,0.00297602335922,0.00297602335922,0.00297602335922,0.00296664936468,0.00295233516954,0.00278695253655,0.0027059239801,0.00261094514281,0.00260491552763,0.00260491552763,0.00260491552763,0.00259099015966,0.00258700852282,0.00205843895674,0.00205843895674,0.00205843895674,0.00205843895674,0.00205517397262,0.00205517397262,0.00205517397262,0.00187848461792,0.00176886992995,0.00173242785968,0.00155313801952,0.00152877555229,0.00149462756235,0.00130754674319,0.00130754674319,0.00130754674319,0.00130754674319,0.000666824460495"

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,10429,"I had to be in the neighborhood for work and had some downtime for an early dinner. I had heard of this place before, but didnt think much of it. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much and was really just looking to kill sometime before my next appointment. The decor was really casual and the inside was dated and tacky. I didn't care since this was more of a functional meal for me than anything else. The menu was almost like a diner menu, but all italian, with the obvious clam menu as well. They had some great selections. They started you out with a generous bread platter which came with a really fresh tasting bruschetta. I figured I would stick to the basics and  ordered Rigatoni filleto di pomodoro. The food arrived quickly in a heaping mound of what had to be almost a pound of pasta. Usually this is huge warning sign of a place that values quantity over quality.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,66183,"I've been frequenting Lenny's for about two years - it's kind of a special spot for my boyfriend and I and for that reason I would love to give it a really high rating, but I have to consider the food, the service, the decor, the staff etc. First of all, I love the area - it's very busy and despite a lot of restaurant choices I will say that we end up here because it's easy and it feels like home. There's something very solid and comforting about Lenny's which gives it that great feeling every time. Also, even if you show up late or close to closing, they will always make sure you are seated and never rush you. (No matter  how packed I have always been seated and served quickly). The hostesses are great, the staff is great, even the bar is great - they are a bit a casual but that makes you feel comfortable. You want to tip them well because the whole staff is working hard. So to the food - the baked clams are AMAZING. They oysters are always very fresh and delicious. These would get the restaurant 5 stars off the bat. Same goes for the arugula fennel salad - surprisingly satisfying and delicious. Basically you can't go wrong with the apps or the soups/salads. So where is the problem? I've been served old bread only to turn it over and find mold on it ...the breadsticks are also stale many times. The bruschetta is good at best. And this is a seafood restaurant, but the seafood isn't really up to par. It doesn't really taste fresh all of the time and a lot of times it's over cooked (think hard shrimp, hard scallops...dry fish.. in the broiled platter.). The pasta dishes are ok but nothing to write home about. However, just when you become unsatisfied with dinner the dessert comes out and the coffee is always fresh, the cannolis are always to die for. Coconut sorbet is also a great treat. The prices are decent. VERDICT: Yes, this restaurant has a lot of sentimental value to me which means I've added an extra star. I say go for a few apps, raw bar, salad and dessert but maybe get one mediocre entree to split and don't look to be impressed. TIP: Sit at the bar if you are in a rush and you will be served quickly. The drink selection is also pretty good and they make good drinks. The place is clean.

The calamari appetizer was very different than usual. Today the rings were huge and barely cooked. When I told the server, the dish was taken back to the kitchen, however the same dish was brought back out and the calamari rings had only been cut into smaller pieces, which were still basically inedible. I also had the lobster tail which was just full of breadcrumbs and not good at all. The service was also poor. The servers were not friendly and were in a rush to get us out. We spoke to someone, apparently the owner, who was not accommodating at all. This is truly the first time I went to Lenny's hungry and left both hungry and disappointed.

The shrimp was well seasonsed, huge, and delicious but the rest of that plate was ok.  The rice was full of butter flavor, to the point where we could barely dig into it, most of the rice was left in the plate.  The linguine was very uninspiring at first glance.  When we had the first fork full, I was sad that I ordered it.  BUT, then i really mixed it into the sauce, threw some red peppers on, and gave a few minutes to soak up the sauce.  Then, and only then, did the dish become flavorful.  Dinner ended with dessert and a coffee.

Luckily, I have 2 friends that frequent this restaurant and suggested the food was worth trying. The service was great! The waitress we had was extremely helpful. I recommend trying the fried calamari, baked clams, and chicken francese. The bread they served was a bit hard and the bruschetta was very messy. Though I like the concept of serving bruschetta instead of just bread and butter, I wouldn't want to eat it again.  The entree portion sizes are huge. I really liked the side salad the meal came with and the penne pasta was al dente and a bit garlicy (which I really liked)! The atmosphere was very homely. I came here during lunch hours so it wasn't too packed. But the restaurant seemed pretty big. The vibe I got was old school Italtian, I got that vibe from the waiters and greeter at the door. Be advised, every month there are different meal specials. For the month of January, the calamari and baked clams are discounted. 1 portion of each is enough to share between 2 people.  I look forward to coming back here and trying the raw bar.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,113080,"This solidly middle-of-the-road restaurant would fit comfortably in a mall in middle America. The large portions are good value for the masses. But discerning diners should seek satisfaction elsewhere. Our helpful waitress Marlene made me wish all casual-restaurant servers were as professional as her. The Calamari Calabrese appetizer and Broiled Filet of Sole entree that she recommended were good. But the lobster tail in the Seafood Fra Diovolo was clearly of the tasteless frozen variety, and the linguini was bland. No amount of spicy sauce could disguise that.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,30970,Oh Lenny's how I love thee! It's been around since 1974. When you want some real authentic Italian this is the place to be. Not to mention they have amazing baked clams. Their menu is very large and extensive. Several months throughout they year they have month long specials. Like January is their anniversary special where appetizers are priced to what they cost back in the day. November they have all you can eat ribs and so fourth. Dinning room is open floor plan and they have two rooms plus a bar area where you can sit and have your meal there as well. Throughout the years I have been to some parties hosted in the back room (bridal and baby showers). Lenny's did a fantastic job each time. My favorite dishes besides the clams are also the chicken sorrentino and chicken francese. Fish dishes are very tasty as well. They have valet parking and are open late. The place is always busy but since it's large it's pretty easy to get a table right away. Don't worry about parking since the valets will take care of it for you. Try their red sangria it's strong!

How could we be so naive.  This place screams tacky and casual disguised as being classy and presentable.  I won't linger too long on the physical lay out of the place because I'm not one that cares for such aspects so long as the food is palatable. Again, ha, how could we be so naive.  The oysters: tasteless. The salads: DRENCHED in industrial strength dressing.  The bruschetta: basically bread + tomato with minimal consideration for flavor.  Now the main dishes.  I ordered the ""chef's special"" which was octopus salad.  Oh my.  I kid you not, it was a salad with mixed greens (and other things like beans and cheese) and uncut pieces of radicchio topped with two mounds of gelatinous gooey octopus.  I am of Mediterranean descent and have consumed considerable amounts of octopus in my life.  This particular octopus experience was like no other.  I am a person who LOVES to eat and will usually finish what is on my plate even if it's not the most desirable meal.  On this particular occasion I forked through my salad, took a few bites of octopus and almost gagged.  I even tried to cover the octopus with the greens and keep eating the salad but I could not even do that.  One person who was in our group is an excellent cook, works in the food industry and has a trustworthy palate.  Even he felt that the food was beyond subpar (his dish was chicken parm).

When I opened the tray today I was so disappointed. For the price I was charged i felt like I was ripped off. It was a thin layer of chicken cutlets that were the size of a little bit bigger than a chicken nugget. On top of each piece of chicken was a small piece of mozzarella cheese that was not melted.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,197671,"This is a great restaurant. I went here with a co-worker while travelling on business, as it was recommended by the front desk staff of the hotel. The hotel was at JFK airport and there is absolutely nothing good in that area so we hopped in a cab and went over to Lenny'sLenny's is on Crossbay Blvd in Queens and this whole street reminds me of an old school gangster movie like Casino or Goodfellas. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere...from the moment you walk in you are greeted by signed photos of movie stars which adds to the ambience. This place is total old school Italian. The waiter walked up to us, shook our hand and immediately introduced himself. When he found out it was out first time there, he basically told us what to order and his suggestions could not have been any better. This just added to the old school atmosphere of this awesome establishment. We started off with the hot antipasto for two which was friggin' amazing. For the main course our waiter ordered us the stuffed pork chop special over sweet potato which impressed the hell out of us both. This guy was spot on with his recommendations. For desert he brought us expresso liquor which tasted like candy. I really wish I knew what it was because I would buy some to keep at home. I love places like this, and it is a shame there are so few around anymore. It was like a trip back in time as far as the service, ambience, and freshness of ingredients goes.

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,4443,"My Fourth of July 2012 was perfect and part of the reason was because of Lenny's Clam Bar. My friend had looked into it before we went kayaking on Crossbay over the bridge courtesy of National Parks Service. We worked up a really good appetite and had delicious seafood.Waterfront dining outdoors in lovely summer weather. For a second, I thought I left the Northeast and transported to a dirtier South Florida. Their menu is so extensive, I never had such trouble choosing something. We joked about the plethora of choice and how too many choices leads to discontent and unhappiness.The best dish was the Seafood Salad Bowl. For a mere $12, you get a heap of mixed seafood - octopus, shrimp, calamari, and others that I can't even name in a delicious olive oil blend with lemon. The blend was so good that we wiped most of it clean with italian bread. I had the linguini with hot tomato sauce and mussles. All of the seafood we had was very fresh. The sauce didn't really impress me, and I was already so full from appetizers that I didn't put a dent in it. We all shared raw clams, too. Excellent. As per the name, nothing more to say about the clams.My girl friend got the stuffed shrimp. I had a couple of bites and loved it! It's made with a tasty bread crumb seasoning and accompanied with sweet and fresh crab. Some others got scungilli and fried calamari. Apparently, I'm not a fan of scungilli (marine snails), but the calamari was just decent. As a huge calamari fan, I've had better too many times to count. The dish also included fried octopus. DO NOT GET THE SANGRIA. This isn't Sangria. It's some brandy and grape juice mix or something it tasted like. A slap in the face to Sangria! This restaurant is pricey but service was great, food was great, sitting outside with amazing company on America's 236th birthday was especially great!

Lenny’s Clam Bar,5487,16103 Crossbay Blvd,Howard Beach,11414.0,2271,"Made reservations for a friday night for a party of 5 at 7:30PM. Smart move.So we show up promptly at 7:20PM and were seated... at 8:20PM. Wait, what?The line was out the door and the hostess was telling everyone that the wait would be 25 minutes. We did not have to stand in said queue thankfully, but there was barely any room to stand in the waiting area either. It was a zoo in there.Furthermore, the manager was berating one of the waitresses who, in my opinion, took it like a champ. I'm sure this guy puts on a good front for his customers - he certainly does for the friends and regulars who know him on a first-name basis - but even if the waitresses need a good talking-to, avoid doing it in front of customers, yeah?When we were finally seated, service was very friendly and helpful - water was refilled with the quickness and food came in a timely manner too.For the months of January and February, certain appetizers are ""throwback"" prices - we got the calamari, steamed mussels, and baked clams (not part of this deal). All excellent! Almost everything was served with the house-made tomato sauce (your choice of mild, medium, or hot). New england chowder was a bit too salty but very chunky!Also on our table were a generous portion of lasagna, the seafood fra diavolo for two, and linguini with white clam sauce. We had no room for dessert and were very much satisfied with our meal. If it weren't for the stellar service and excellent food, the hour-long wait and distasteful exchange between manager and waitress would have soured the experience. I'll continue to visit Lenny's Clam Bar, but never again on a friday evening. Minus 1 star for not actually honoring our reservation.

I thought it would be a bit more upscale, but either way, I was here for the food.We started off with the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, which were good.We also tried the eggplant rollatini - the eggplant was too thick, the sauce too tartFor entrees, we have the penne a la vodka which was good, the tortellini Alfredo was average and lacking taste (the sauce), the eggplant parm was a good texture but again, the red sauce was too tart and thusly, the meal wasn't enjoyable. The baked clams were good, which is probably what this place is known for. I'd come back to mess around with more of the seafood, but wouldn't order anything that we had today again.

That person had left the restaurant already. The valets returned to inform me they lost my keys. After about 15 minutes of me asking what would be done while the valets continued to park other cars and ignore me, a manager finally came outside organized a ride for me back to my house (with the valet who lost my keys, who spoke no English) to get a spare key. Upon returning to the restaurant I was ignored by parties, manager and valet, took my own car from the parking lot and drove home. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism I experienced here. I received no apologies until I called the next day to speak to the owner.  Fortunately, I found out later that my keys were left in a coworkers car and I was able to get them back, but the Lenny's and valet staff seemed to have cared less about my car and house keys being misplaced throughout the process.

We were told that they could not switch us out. Waitress was not knowledgeable about basic dishes. For a place that calls itself a clam bar the raw clams we ordered were full with sand ( basically not properly cleaned and prepared) and linguine with white clam sauce that came to the table with no shells, chopped up all different sizes they tasted and looked like canned clams or prepared to far in advance, giving it a rubbery texture and no fresh clam taste. C'mon people this is shellfish it must be fresh and prepared properly. The steak we ordered was tough to cut and eat. Service was so so that was do to that waitress we had.

However, everything since that first order has been downhill. The second time I ordered, I tried their round pie and their crust was soggy, appearing to be under cooked a bit and the cheese was stuck to the top of the box a bit when it was delivered. The next time I ordered, the pizza box was dented in as if the delivery guy piled too much weight on top of it and the box caved in and messed up their delicious grandma pie inside.

As a pizzeria, Lenny's is a completely acceptable utility slice joint.  This is average NY style pizza but below average for Brooklyn.As Lenny's shows it's age, so does the proprietors of what's left of the old neighborhood pizzeria's.  Most owners, after years of slaving over ovens in hot NYC summers, have rightfully checked out for retirement.  Many of these guys have sold to owners without the cultural tradition or passed along the day-to-day.  There's something to be said for that touch, and unfortunately it hasn't gotten passed along in most slice joints left.Once, there were places like Lenny's every few blocks, a virtual pizza cornucopia.  A mecca of mozzarella.  Every square block had a pizzeria, a bakery, and a deli.  And they all competed for customers who knew their stuff. Lenny's should be celebrated.  Not so much for it's pizza.  Or it's beautiful old sign.  Or it's awesome picture of Travolta & Stallone wearing fur coats.  Enjoy it for it's tenacity through a half century of change in a tough neighborhood.  The same tenacity that's a part of all Brooklyn born.Tony Manero Double-Decker Slice Struttin' youtube.com/watch?v=y0IL…",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,8.39999961853,"Tony Manero,place,slices,place,Brooklyn.As Lenny,style pizza,scene,hand,Saturday Night Fever,86th St.,tenacity,something,Brooklyn,neighborhood,pizzeria,neighborhood pizzeria,bowels,history,movie,utility slice joint,fur coats,owners,owners,Tony Manero Double-Decker Slice Struttin,slice joints,pizza,proprietors,average,retirement,ovens,Many,guys,tradition,touch,Brooklyn South,customers,stuff,picture,sign,NYC,neighborhood,tenacity,places,change,pizzeria,Travolta,Stallone,block,blocks,pizza cornucopia,mozzarella,mecca,bakery,deli,y0IL","1,7,7,7,1,7,5,7,5,2,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,5,7,7,1,1,1,7,6,1,7,4,7,1,1,7,7,5,1,7,5,7,2,2,7,2,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7","0.181636989117,0.159683868289,0.115023069084,0.103651821613,0.0604368560016,0.0423448085785,0.0383662134409,0.0383662134409,0.0228795912117,0.0228795912117,0.0187217798084,0.0126785775647,0.0118350973353,0.00881412345916,0.00713351694867,0.00711341807619,0.0070546977222,0.0070546977222,0.0070546977222,0.00669392105192,0.00583441695198,0.00537090981379,0.00536044221371,0.00494716688991,0.00489766383544,0.00480823637918,0.00471085356548,0.00471085356548,0.00469999294728,0.00469999294728,0.00469082966447,0.00469082966447,0.00469082966447,0.00428573787212,0.00418045837432,0.00412190519273,0.00410937983543,0.00369887147099,0.00318003445864,0.00279022776522,0.00276240683161,0.00251259375364,0.0023337204475,0.00219833990559,0.00211743707769,0.00188129942399,0.00188129942399,0.00170628668275,0.00160601444077,0.00140506902244,0.00140297203325,0.00140297203325,0.00140109902713,0.00140109902713,0.00130041188095"

The food really is delicious and I have a weakness for zeppoles, which they sell (you'd be surprised at how many pizzerias don't, it's kind of ridiculous). If this place was within walking distance to my apartment, I'd be a regular.That being said, I'm not within walking distance and the delivery sucks. Awhile back, I ordered via Seamless and I remember it taking them longer than the average restaurant to bring my food. But whatever, it happens, and the food was worth it. Last night, I did another Seamless order: penne vodka, sausage and peppers, and two orders of zeppoles. It was confirmed via email that they had received my order. 45 minutes later, I'm looking at the clock as my stomach is growling. I figure, ""Okay, it's not that long. Maybe they're really busy."" Then an hour goes by... and an hour fifteen. This is when I decided to call. I called twice and both times the phone rang and rang. The third time I called a very impatient sounding worker answered.

Lenny’s Pizza,5488,1969 86th St,Brooklyn,11214.0,149262,"There are several ""Lenny's"" in New York, including three in Brooklyn, and one broken link on Google maps that takes you to ""Lenny's Sub Shops.""  Just to be precise, this review is about Lenny's Pizza on 86th Street in Bensonhurst.  This Lenny's will always be famous for the opening scenes of ""Saturday Night Fever"" when John Travolta's character Tony Manero stops into Lenny's for two slices and then proceeds to fold them together and eat them as inelegantly as Donald Trump might.Nice bit of history, but how is the pie?  We stopped by on a Saturday night to find out. Lots of Brooklyn has been gentrified and cleaned up since 1977 when Tony Manero struggled to escape the drudgery of life in Bay Ridge, but this stretch of 86th Street, under the elevated railway tracks, looks and feels like the tired and worn New York of the pre-Giuliani years. Given the history, the time-warp feel was sort of appropriate.On the counter we saw a thin ""Gran Ma"" pie, a conventional plain pizza, and a ""margherita"" which was mostly a regular pie where the dry mozzarella was replaced with fresh mozzarella. We ordered a slice of each ($2.50 or $2.75 per slice) and settled in to try them.The plain pie was, except for its thin and crisp (but NOT tomato pie style) crust, unremarkable for the most part except that it tasted really good! Was it the ghost of Tony Manero?  I dunno, somehow this pie reminded me of when ""ordinary"" pizza tasted great. Not magical, but clearly a cut above the ordinary.The margherita had an identical crust, and the cheese upgrade should have elevated it above the conventional slice. Well, it was a good slice, but no better than the regular slice. A hint of fresh basil would have helped.Finally, the ""Gran Ma"" slice. ""Grandma"" pizza seems unique to New York. It's best described as ""Sicilian Lite."" A thin a crispy crust, with a balanced topping of cheese and sauce. This was a delight -- sweet sauce almost dripping off, nicely browned cheese, and a thin crust with good flavor sturdy enough to hold it all together.Lenny's is very good pie, the kind that would enhance any neighborhood. It's not ""destination"" pie like DiFara's, but on the other hand you can walk in a get a slice without a two hour wait. ""Worth the trip"" if you're coming from Dyker Heights, for sure.  Otherwise, let's call it a ""can't-miss"" place if you are in the area. I give Lenny's 7.5 stars out of 10. Not New York's best, but miles ahead of West Chester (PA) pie.

I really enjoyed the pizza which was very good. The crust was just right, light and crispy......exactly the way that I like it. On my second visit, I decided to bring my son because he absolutely loves to eat pepperoni rolls whenever we go to pizzerias. I brought him here because I noticed on my first visit that instead of  offering the traditional pepperoni rolls, Lenny's actually did something a little different and made pepperoni wheels. What stood out to me was the fact that it was bigger and only $1.50.......yes you read it correctly only $1.50. My son said that it was really good so a special shoutout to Lenny's on a job well done!I also noticed that they offer several specials on pizza orders. For example, you can get small pie for $6.00........I thought that I seeing things when I saw the prices but it is the real deal. For only $2.00 extra, you can choose to top your pizza with a topping of your choice......how cool is that......pretty awesome to me! The staff are really nice and friendly. The pizzeria gets a lot of business so they must be doing something good. I only gave this review three stars because of the decor and lack of seating. There are three tables to accommodate customers but one table area is covered with empty pizza boxes. I think that they should invested in a new coat of paint to make the place a little more inviting upon walking into the business.

He said they should be there in a minute. I said ok and hung up, only to receive my order a half hour later. At first, the delivery man did not want to make the simple walk up the front steps. I felt that he was just taking advantage of the fact that I'm 14 and thought that I was going to go along with whatever he wanted to do. After I made it clear that I was under no circumstances going to come outside, he reluctantly climbed the stairs and gave me my order. I did not feel like tipping him at all. When I opened the food, I was disappointed. The chicken tasted like no other chicken had ever tasted before; it was the worst. And on top of that, the fries were cold and you could tell that the steam from the once hot meal had made it a bit soggy. It was the worst meal ever, but I was extremely hungry and continued to eat it. But I was a little surprised at how little time it took me to feel full, but I overlooked that.

Lenny’s Pizza,5490,1845 Nostrand Ave,Brooklyn,11226.0,197142,"I've been using Lenny's as my local pizza spot for years, and I've never had any real issue with them, save for the occasional lack of time management they seem to operate under. I'd also like to think of myself as a very chill, laid-back kind of individual that doesn't let too much get under her skin-I've never even written a Yelp review before! But when you're already having one of those days, and the person in control of your food source, the only thing that can practically save you, rubs you the wrong way, even the littlest of things can blow up. For some odd reason, the parlor, not the delivery person, calls me to tell me that the delivery guy is outside. I'm weirded out, but whatever. When I go downstairs, no one is in sight. I give it a couple of minutes before I start to get slightly irritated, but I calm myself down and call the parlor back to figure out what's going on. A guy different from the first answers the phone, with a heavier accent. I let him know what's going on, only for him to tell me that the delivery guy went to the wrong address. In hindsight, I should have kept it in mind that mistakes happen, but I'm already not in a great mood and starving, so, naturally, I get a little snippy. Mr. Clearly-Not-a-Manager decides to then make Colossal Customer Service Mistake # 5 of blaming me for the issue, telling me that I must have given him the wrong address. (Note: I did not, as the first guy I spoke to double checked my address for me.) So, naturally, my mega-bitch mode is activated and I demand to know what's going to happen as he tells me he needs two minutes to call the guy, to which I basically command him to do his job and hang up on him. I was honestly planning on being difficult and refusing to pay and not giving a tip, but from my four years of customer service, I know that it's not fair to blame someone for something that someone higher up is at fault for.

Lenny’s Pizza,5491,1040 Nostrand Ave,Brooklyn,11225.0,159110,"I've been ordering pizza from Lenny's for as long as I could remember because it's close to my home + there was never really a lot of pizza options in this part of Crown Heights/Prospect Lefferts Garden.Up until I was a teenager I had only ever had the pizza from Lenny's because that's all my parents would buy. When I became more independent in my food choices/began ordering stuff just for myself I began to try a bunch of things from their menu. The pizza is pretty decent. They've definitely improved over the years especially with the newer management/owners but at the end of the day I've had better pizzas. Not to say that there slice and pies aren't enjoyable. Lenny's definitely gets the job done when it comes to satiating that pizzeria craving. It's also worth noting that Lenny's does not sell pork products.  I grew up in a Muslim household so that has always been much appreciated.The consistency of there food is pretty good too. I'm one of those people who orders the same thing over and over again when I really like it so I'm confident in my opinion towards the food. I believe frequent customers of Lenny's will tell that every so often the food/service is either exceptionally good or incredibly disappointing. But at the end of the day I'm 99.2% Lenny's will never close as it's been here for 15+ years already. The guys at the counter are really nice year round and I think they realize their place in the neighborhood.

It's not blow me out of this world pizza but its not bad either. It's average - but good average. Crispy crust, good cheese to sauce ratio. They keep re-making new pizzas all night long so it tasted fresh and piping hot. We decided to splurge after noticing there were 40s of Bud in the fridge. Asked how much they were - only $3. To sit and split a huge thing of beer at a pizza place, kind of an awesome deal. The owner was being silly and dropping pans as we were sitting and chatting. My friend joked that he should probably give us another 40 of bud for making so much noise. Much to my embarrassment and shock the owner opens up another bottle for us free of charge.

I tried a margarita slice here, which had likely been sitting out all day, then reheated to an acceptable temperature, along with some garlic knots. The slice was nothing to write home about--cardboardy crust, not very tasty sauce, not especially fresh mozzarella. The garlic knots were wrapped in tinfoil on their way into the oven, and as a result, needed to be reheated longer than my slice. Due to the rush job of the counter person, I received lukewarm, though tasty and cheap knots. Incidentally, an Italian-American friend of mine who lives nearby concluded that the sauce served on the side here with rolls (and possibly also the sauce on all the pies) consists solely of canned tomato juice.

Walking in, you can tell the place has been open a long time, just from the design and layout of the pizzeria is an indication. It's a classic, old school pizzeria that offers pretty much all of what NY pizzerias offer. Once you get inside, there is a display of what they sell from reg slices, to sicilians, to grandmas to margaritas etc but the first thing that I noticed on all the pies, which was a very bad indication of how my pizza would turn out, was the cheap look of the cheese. I was born and raised in NY and I have been eating pizza since I was a little kid and as much as I appreciate the nostalgia of a classic, old school pizzeria, the pizza here was a miss.The food:Grandma slice- This is usually my go to since you usually have a nice tangy sauce that combines a focaccia like bottom with nice stringy cheese, this was not. It tasted like toasted cardboard with government cheese. #SadFace This might have to be one of the worse Grandma slices I ever had. When you use cheap ingredients, a bad end product will show. On the bright side, the sauce was pretty good, it had a nice tang. Reg slice- The cheese was the first thing I noticed and it wasn't pretty.

I stopped in later on in the evening on a Friday to grab something quick on the way to a friend's nearby apartment. I was on the hungrier side so I grabbed a plain slice and a chicken roll. Staff was quick about putting it together, and very friendly (politely offered me a side of sauce for dipping). The slice was an excellent standard NY slice - good amount of cheese, well-seasoned sauce, just firm enough crust - thought it cost a little more than I would've liked to pay for a plain slice.The chicken roll left a lot to be desired. The chicken was cut up in little cubes (never a good sign - always better to get a solid piece running the length of the roll) which were dry and flavorless. The cheese and sauce were limited, leaving a lot of empty space inside the crust. The whole thing had probably been made earlier in the day than my slice, and seemed to suffer from the reheating.Verdict: I would recommend the pizza and atmosphere at Lenny's, but would warn against the chicken roll.",3.0 star rating,"Cambridge, MA",2,1,0.0,4.09999990463,"amount,review,something,slice,chicken roll,Staff,side,lot,way,apartment,friend,chicken roll,sauce,sauce,chicken,side,cheese,dipping,slice,lot,cubes,thing,crust,space,chicken roll,NY,Verdict,atmosphere,roll,pizza,piece,sauce,sign,Lenny,length,cheese","7,5,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7","0.253680348396,0.137086555362,0.0662919282913,0.0364010855556,0.0342943631113,0.0301961787045,0.0290142465383,0.0262824743986,0.025534786284,0.025534786284,0.025534786284,0.0222007725388,0.0214899741113,0.0214295387268,0.0210593640804,0.019553694874,0.0194986779243,0.017115931958,0.0166615955532,0.0157302059233,0.0155868371949,0.0133440801874,0.0132894515991,0.011630365625,0.0108746150509,0.0101172598079,0.00804335158318,0.00804335158318,0.0076379799284,0.00708653405309,0.00659186998382,0.00641618808731,0.00511628109962,0.00476345652714,0.00433909660205,0.00252797058783"

He's generous to his customers, and will give you free sode/garlic knots (which are great) if he's in a good mood.

Based on the other reviews and the crowd they usually have, I might tell you that maybe I just went on an off day, or maybe it's just really not my taste, but nevertheless, here is my experience:The first thing I noticed here is the decor. Very nicely put together and I love the beautiful chalk drawings outside as well as the art they have on the walls.When we first walked in there were a variety of pizzas behind the glass case. The guy behind the counter was a bit rude and made me feel a bit rushed. I can understand that they want to move fast but it was us and one other person on line, it's not like they had a crazy crowd at that moment. Anyways, it's a pizzeria, I'm not here for the service but figured it's worth mentioning, so on to the pizza.I opted for a plain slice and a grandma slice which looked nice and crispy. And my boyfriend got the chicken and buffalo slice as well as the chicken and onion. Total: $12.00. I also asked for a bottle of water. The cashier told me they don't have water. No water? Ok... I ended up going to the deli across the street for that and I'm glad I did because I really needed something to get the taste out of my mouth.When we got the pizza and sat down to eat, the slices looked really good. I love a slice of good pizza but after my first bite I was immediately disappointed. The crust was thin, and looked crispy but it was really a bit soggy and based on how white the bottom of it was, I can say with certainty that it was undercooked. As for the flavor, it tasted bland to me. The sauce tasted like garlic powder and nothing else. Not my taste. When I was halfway done with the slice, I started feeling sick, and decided that it was not even worth finishing. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and feeling like I wasted my money.

Lenny’s Pizza,5493,44-08 Greenpoint Ave,Sunnyside,11104.0,166054,"I've lived in Greenpoint, Brooklyn my whole life and recently moved to Sunnyside with my fiance. This was the first pizzeria we ordered from when we moved to the area. It's right down the block from us, but they take so long to deliver the food. I've never waited so long for a pizza in my life. We've had them deliver us a large pie on 3 separate occasions and 2 of those times the pizzas were bright orange from the amount of grease on them. What's weird is that both times, we didn't have any toppings, just cheese. So, it's not like it could have been grease from pepperoni or anything. It tasted horrible, too. We chose never to order anymore deliveries from them again.Aside from the delivery nightmares of this place, we have dined in a handful of times and the pizza was actually pretty tasty. I don't know why it tastes different when we eat in, but it does and it's not orange, either. Their Philly Cheese Steak pizza is ok, but not really worth buying. I've also seen one of the guys behind the counter, I'm not sure if he's the owner or what, hanging his head out of the side window, staring at all the girl's asses who walk by on the street, numerous times. It's really disgusting.If you're driving around in Sunnyside and decide on getting some pizza, I really suggest you drive 5 more minutes to Greenpoint, Brooklyn and go to Russ, Italy (both on Manhattan Ave.) or Carmine's (on Norman Ave.) pizzerias. They are a million times better and they're best pizza joints I've ever been to. My family and I have been ordering from them for years. Carmine's is just really good, nothing more to say about it. Russ has great pizza and the absolute best strombolis, ever. And Italy has amazing extra cheese pizza. If you want to stick to a Sunnyside pizzeria, I would recommend Marabella's over this place any day.Update: We gave them one last try not long after I had posted this and all I can say is I've never been so nauseous from one single bite of food in my life. The whole entire pie tasted like seafood. Literally. LIKE AN OCEAN. I called up to let them know that we couldn't even eat it. They said they have seafood there, but nowhere near the ingredients for the pizza. They said they'd make us a new one if we brought back the pie. My fiance brings it back and says they opened the box and smelled inside. Then they were showing my fiance the clean area they were using. He brought the pizza home, we sat down to eat and the same damn thing! FISH! They should change their name from Lenny's to Fishy's. I walked by one day when there was a truck delivering tomatoes or something and it REAKED of fish. Way too nasty!

For pasta.  Lenny's Pizza is the first pasta shop to show up on the radar located in the awkward 6 way cross street of Greenpoint and 44th.  By far the best pasta I have discovered in Queens.As soon as I entered, the cashier warmly greeted me and directed me to the menus against the wall.  The menu is quite extensive with variety of pizza's, pastas, and Italian food, quite overwhelming at first glace.  I ordered a small (large available) linguine with clams in white sauce, my favorite of pastas.  The cashier asked me to sit anywhere I'd like and after 5 minutes, delivered the food directly to me.  This place is not fast food nor a restaurant, but provides fantastic service!The linguine with clams was elegantly presented with fine linguine in the center sprinkled with sliced clam bites and six little neck clams surrounding the perimeter of the dish all emerged in white clam sauce blended in olive oil.  Also served was two pieces of freshly baked garlic bread and one soft bun.  Slurping on the noodles and dipping the bread in the white clam sauce rendered total satisfaction.  The finest of pasta was devoured here for the fraction of the price for this dish at another restaurant.  Lenny's Pizza is truly an undiscovered hidden gem in the heart of Sunnyside and I will be returning!",5.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,8.60000038147,"Lenny's Pizza,pizza,Pizza shop,lactose,reviewer step,pasta,pasta shop,Yelp,clams,clam sauce,radar,pasta,cashier,pastas,pastas,cross street,pizza,fast food,menu,food,linguine,sauce,menus,food,linguine,place,restaurant,pasta,linguine,wall,glace,variety,favorite,anywhere,cashier,Greenpoint,Queens.As,garlic bread,bread,service,bun,noodles,finest,satisfaction,Italian,restaurant,dish,fraction,price,heart,neck clams,pieces,dish,perimeter,center,clam bites,olive oil,Sunnyside","6,6,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,2,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,6,6,7,6,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,2","0.203643858433,0.0861165598035,0.0689655914903,0.0605254434049,0.050231769681,0.0437283851206,0.0408585965633,0.0361480601132,0.0349450297654,0.0297503042966,0.0289375223219,0.0166937336326,0.0129652684554,0.0112557765096,0.0112298754975,0.0111058773473,0.0106998868287,0.0105638904497,0.0104299271479,0.00936485920101,0.0093432944268,0.0093432944268,0.00854368787259,0.00853506010026,0.00852065626532,0.00830550771207,0.00775137962773,0.0076260138303,0.00750809768215,0.00747693702579,0.00745585467666,0.00745585467666,0.00743867363781,0.00742417806759,0.00675551127642,0.00658286735415,0.00655893934891,0.00578497815877,0.00577726634219,0.00519962934777,0.00506202317774,0.00505527295172,0.00504917418584,0.00486679328606,0.00441690487787,0.00399644719437,0.00399644719437,0.00349671486765,0.00349671486765,0.00349286128767,0.00336159416474,0.00265256641433,0.00254259677604,0.00222450890578,0.00222450890578,0.00222450890578,0.00222450890578,0.00206794869155"

Lenny’s Pizza,5493,44-08 Greenpoint Ave,Sunnyside,11104.0,2104,"After a relatively shakey start, Lenny's has blossomed into one of the more stellar pizza joints in Sunnyside. With plenty of pizza competition throughout Greenpoint Ave, Lenny's has managed to stand out by offering some of the hood's heartiest slices / pies while remaining reasonably priced and tasty.When I first had their regular pie, the cheese was practically falling off the slices. The crust was burnt but the sauce was solid. A first glimpse of the now defunct Taco pizza (thank goodness), was a disaster. The pie was not only heavy and messy, but it the beef was completely unseasoned and the fixins were so bland that my group of pizza lovers and I actually didn't bother with more than half the pizza left. On top of that, the delivery was ridiculously slow and the website was hideous.Now more than a year into their existence and they've come full circle. The website is much better, delivery is fairly quick, and they've managed to turn their place into a regular haunt for many Greenpoint goers. Their slices when fresh out of the oven are decent and they've done away with the odd specialty pizzas and stuck to the simple stuff. Unlike most of the takeout pizza joints in the area, Lenny's offers quite a few tables for in-dining and has taken some consideration into their presentation with pasta dishes and pies.Not sure where to start? I recommend the vegan nightmares pie (i.e. meat lovers), a hearty pie that has no skimpage of meats featuring army of pepperoni, bacon, and sausage bits.

As I walked towards the place I noticed a rather small line to get in. After literally a 2 minute wait and getting carded, I was ushered inside. Once inside I proceeded to look for my friends who were near the back. The place is a bit small so I didn't have to look very long before I found them.  However, the place was very packed & people continued to pour in throughout the night despite the size of the location.We enjoyed a platter of tasty fried treats like chicharron, yuca, platains, etc. There were a couple of sauces available for this. Not sure what the name of the platter is, but I really enjoyed it. The drinks were good yet inexpensive. We enjoyed a pitcher of sangria, a bottle of Aguardiente (Colombian liquor), and a couple of cocktails which were 9 to 11 dollar range.Lenos is a good spot if you want to enjoy some good food, Colombian music, and drinks. The staff is definitely very friendly and attentive.

In order to make it fun at Rubios you have to bring your own crowd.... here you would have fun whether theres a crowd or not. There are tv's all over the establishment showing the videos accompanying the songs that are being played (mostly Colombian vallenatos or salsa). They also play bachata, merengue and reggaeton  but what I love most is the vallenatos mostly because I am not Colombian and I really enjoy the different experience. The servers are some what attentive, they don't come to your table to ask if you need anything, but they do attend to you when you call for them right away so can't say anything negative about that. The drinks are great (We usually order the mojitos, maracuyao/mora) ....they don't taste like your typical mojito.

We are regular customers of Leños. Unfortunately, on July 3, 2017 my experience at Leños turned out poorly.  I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the customer service provided by the waiters at Leños, with the hope they can help remedy the situation.Right from the beginning my experience was the worst ever. We arrived at Leños at 9:30pm. We consumed a picada, two bottles of Tequila 4 drinks of Ciroq and 4 buckets of beer between 4 people. The waiter was rude from the beginning, we ordered water and the waiter never brought it to us.  The only thing the waiter was doing was pressuring us to buy more drinks. We were going to continue ordering but we needed to take a break and order water. It was around 2am in the morning when he stated that if we are not going to order anymore we needed to move from the table. The waiter tried to kick us out of the table, so we had to order an other bucket of beer by force. Then we order water and it never arrived. Finally, the billed came and we decided not to leave any tip because the waiter provided bad customer service.  Since the waiter kept bothering us the whole night, we only paid for the food and drinks we order. We didn't leave any tip. One of the waiters was nasty and yelling in our faces, threading us like garbage, we consumed about $400.00 USD. That was the worst experience of my life, the waiter got aggressive and and was saying that we owed him money, the manager got involved and he agreed with us. I am very sad with the service they provided us that day.

Of their sandwiches by favorites are the Emma, with smoked turkey and smoked ham, and the Smoked Chicken Deluxe, with chicken cutlet, thinly sliced pastrami, and sweet/sour pickles.

I looked around to make sure that I wasn't the only one. Two guys next to me had trays and napkins fully enjoying their meals. I didn't even want to go back to the cashier stand to ask for napkins because of how rude these girls were. I ended up going back because I wasn't sure if a drink and chips came included and didn't want to assume that they did.

Lenwich,5498,418 6th Ave,New York,10011.0,197644,"The food here is decent. It seems fresh enough but my  bad experience that I had to write about today is regarding ordering from Lenny's on the phone. I order in for meetings mostly for my boss and his guests and when it's a small meeting, I allow the guests to choose from the menu instead of just getting a sandwich platter. To avoid time wasted and confusion, I always ask Lenny's to bag each person's lunch separately with their name on it.       Not rocket science right? And the past few times that I have called, they've handled it fairly well, with just a few hiccups, but nothing worth reviewing. I wouldn't be on here saying something about it if it was something I could ignore, as I don't like to throw people under the bus. The fact that I am here is a testament to how pissed off I am.        Anyway, on to my phone ordering experience. I very clearly explained this to the girl who picked up the phone how I wanted the items bagged(that each person's lunch should be bagged separately with their name on it, and even told her how I've ordered from Lenny's plenty of times and had them do this for me with no issues) . She told me that she could do that for me. I read her each order slowly with each guests name mentioned before their order so she could group their items separately. I had to repeat things a few times, but that was okay. She seemed to have a bit of attitude, but that was okay. This is typical.         What was not okay was  that when I asked her to read back each person's order, she started reading everything back in the wrong order and missed something also. It didn't look like she grouped each persons lunch items together at all!  What's more was she gave me attitude when I asked her if she could read back each person's order separately.      I understand that perhaps her POS system might just print out all the items in random order, but I assumed that since she said she could package each person's lunch separately, that she was somehow keeping track of who was getting what.     At that point she got flustered, put me on hold came back on in like 2 minutes and said she had to take my entire order all over again! Now why would she need to do that unless she didn't keep track of each person's order from the get-go.      Now I literally had to start over and at this point the phone call is nine minutes and I had to reread everything to her. I didn't budget for that much time wasted on a simple lunch order for 3 people!

I say, ""Yes onions, no tomatoes or avocado.""I pay, get my ticket, and wait... and wait... and wait. No one is making anything that looks like my sandwich.

Thank you for putting the food that was supposed to be done ten minutes ago at the ""top of the list."" It then took forever to make anyway, which they excused by saying it was a new item. I offered to tell them what was in it just to speed things up. All in all, what was supposed to be a quick stop turned out to be a stressful chore -- I just barely made the bus in time.

The food back then was four to five star in quality, the pizza was excellent and my favorite dish, which was a total knock out was the shrimp parmigiana. Bar none, one of the best I have ever had.Fast forward to the current year and date...What the heck happened?The shrimp parmigiana was nothing like I had experienced prior. Served in the small rectangle tin, as opposed to the circular and larger tin, the contents were indescribable. The sauce must have been on its last legs, in actuality I think the legs were already out from under the sauce.The pasta was gummy and the shrimp were frozen too long and thawed out too quick, resulting in a broken down pink mush.I was already conjuring up the contents of my one star review, but thought it wise to give a call to express my great displeasure with the food. The manager offered me a full credit, sight unseen as I offered to drive it back to Leone's while really wanting to bury it in St. John's Cemetery across the street. The Tomb of the Unknown Takeout Dinner. The credit was affixed to the cork board and when it was to be redeemed for an eggplant parmigiana and Manicotti, there were no questions, just a kind exchange and a pleasant transaction. I was expecting ""who did you speak to?"" ""Sorry, I was not working that day...yadda ..yadda.""However the food is just not the same as I remember, even on the redo.

And this happened twice to me. So in a way I was a bit upset because I truly wanted it. Both occasions I ordered fettuccine Alfredo which is clearly on the menu as a pasta dish. The first time, we waited a little bit of time to be seated until they realized that we were waiting for a seat. We were seated and the waitress was very polite. She informed us of some of their specialty dishes. But regardless of what she said, all I could think about was my favorite dish which is the fettuccine Alfredo. So naturally I ordered that, and she tells me that they don't have fettuccine but can replace it with Linguine instead. Im not too much of a fan of Linguine but eh, I guess it would do. After taking our order, she came back with some hot bread for us to enjoy and lemme say, it was definitely enjoyable. Wish I didn't eat them all though considering the plate that I ordered. The food came in about 15 minutes, which meant that the pasta was fresh, al dente to some extent. I dove in, and barely moved my mouth from the plate. The Alfredo sauce was awesome, but was diminished by the linguine. Again, its a matter of opinion and taste. After a few sprinkles of pepper and some Parmesan cheese, I was off to the races. I thought I ate more than half, but realized that my plate with still very full. Eventually, I just took the rest to go. The second Time I came, I ordered the same thing from the menu and again was told they don't have Fettuccine. I was starting to wonder if this was something out of season like fruit lol. IN any case, they offered me the same replacement and I agreed. And it was still delectable as I remembered. My wife ordered the lasagna and she was impressed by its flavor and abundance of meat.

Just look at the crowds...fedex, UPS drivers, local business people, seniors...the place always has a line for lunch and there's a good reason. the soups are tasty, the portions huge, the lasagna cheesy, and they even have rice dishes, veggies and other such goodies. If these working class folks keep coming back, there's a reason.Some dishes are the regular, unexceptional but well prepared standards...and then there are little surprises that make this place popular.  Their Philly cheese steak sandwich is killer good...crunchy toasted bread, cheesy soft, thin steak!  Their beef and barley soup tastes nothing like the typical beef and barley and is actually some other creation that just happens to be in the same food family...but it's one of my favorite soups (they use tomato based soup and ground beef...go figure)...but it tastes awesome.  And on Fridays: seafood rice!  It's wet, tomato based, sweet and full of shrimp and seafood.  It's not cheap but not really anymore than you would pay for a rice dish anywhere else.

I'm not sure if it was the owner, but the host checked on us every few minutes and told us he would have a table for us soon. It was longer than they said it would be, but we honestly didn't mind.

Then we got our food and my friend got her order messed up so they had to make a new one and wait more additional time for someones mistake. As well she did not notice to refill our water glasses ( or at least someone ) didnt give us anymore extra napkins considering we only 1 each for the whole meal. Not even a fork for the food was given. Its ridiculous to have people work at this rate considering the fact i heard good stuff about the food. And to end the night. We got BILLED for the drinks the server forgot and never gave us! Crazy right? She never brung them and we still get billed.

Leo’s Casa Calamari,5503,8602 3rd Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,61737,"This is a pizzeria with a twenty table restaurant to the side, a confusing and awkward layout. But once settled in, it does appear that both seem to be operating smoothly and in synch. The twisted Italian bread is delicious, especially when warm. Butter is simply packets, not freshly cut and plated. I started with the seafood salad. As expected, calamari was the dominant ingredient. There was also octopus, mussel and some shrimp. It comes with plenty of oil, lemon, celery and parsley. It was very fresh, tasty, a healthy portion and decent enough value. I moved on to the veal parmigiana. It came with a potato croquette and mixed vegetables. The meat was cooked to a nice medium level. My sauce and cheese were perfect complements. The vegetables are carrots, broccoli and cauliflower, neither too raw or overdone. It is priced about twenty percent less than a basic white tablecloth restaurant, which does provide diners with superior ambiance. I did enjoy Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune on the overhead TVs, a nice solo diner perk. I chose to sit as far from the bar as possible. There was a couple enjoying a pizza pie at one table. This is basically a waste of money. Pizza usually travels well, and they could have easily done take out or delivery. The  establishment is simply a poorly jumbled space. It would be much more elegant to have curtains or some other partition separating the bar, pizzeria and restaurant areas, rather than wrecking the ambiance. This is apparently unimportant to ownership. As long as food quality is maintained, it is a minor complaint. A few dessert offerings would be much appreciated as well.

Good house wine, at a great price, delicious bread basket with authentic seeded Italian bread, great baked clams, and the soup, clam chowder, was enough for three people, the bowl was so huge.The main course of shrimp and calamari in fra diavalo sauce was outstanding and there was so much, I made three meals of it, one in the restaurant and two with the doggie bag I brought home. My parents had the veal and the fried shrimp, also excellent. You can have pasta or potato croquette and veggies on the side if you are trying to eat light. My dish was the best, I think. I have never eaten such great calamari before, not the least rubbery, and the shrimp were melt in the mouth, they were cooked so well.We loved it so much we are already planning my mother's birthday meal there. I am definitely ordering the same again!It was closed for a while after the fire; so glad to see it back again and better than ever. Staff were great; one small point is that there are a lot of TVs around the room, all playing different sports channels, which might annoy people. It would usually annoy me but I didn't pay attention after the first few minutes, and definitely not once I started to eat! If you want a bit more comfortable seating, ask for a booth.  Oh, one other thing, the menu has 4 pages, not two-the book is so thick, my parents almost missed the back pages, but I had seen the menu online and knew what to look for in terms of the list of entrees and pizzas etc.   And there are daily specials, so be sure to check those out too.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,8.80000019073,"birthday,dish,parents,bread basket,soup,baked clams,bread,house,clam chowder,price,wine,calamari,Italian,one,shrimp,shrimp,course,calamari,meals,people,sauce,restaurant,bowl,shrimp,point,birthday meal,doggie bag,home,veal,light,veggies,potato croquette,side,pasta,mouth,mother,people,menu,fire,sports channels,book,thing,pages,specials,seating,booth,back pages,menu,terms,list,entrees,pizzas,Staff,room,TVs,attention,lot","4,7,1,7,7,7,6,2,6,7,6,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,4,3,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,2,7,7,7","0.157709568739,0.0514686591923,0.051434841007,0.0418564975262,0.0418564975262,0.0400766953826,0.0400766953826,0.0351004712284,0.0351004712284,0.0351004712284,0.0351004712284,0.0261060930789,0.0208408534527,0.0168924275786,0.0168924275786,0.0165372919291,0.0160551778972,0.0153684578836,0.0153684578836,0.0153684578836,0.0134503375739,0.0134503375739,0.0134503375739,0.011372147128,0.0100413858891,0.00940085481852,0.00908551365137,0.00908551365137,0.00905247963965,0.00902693811804,0.00902693811804,0.00902693811804,0.00902693811804,0.00902693811804,0.00898856204003,0.00898856204003,0.00857614446431,0.00833125505596,0.00821219012141,0.00797517132014,0.00747695891187,0.00728991953656,0.00697748968378,0.00641599530354,0.00611185282469,0.00611185282469,0.00483179045841,0.00483179045841,0.00422741984949,0.00422741984949,0.00422741984949,0.00422741984949,0.00355287175626,0.00268801581115,0.00268801581115,0.0026844269596,0.00252287089825"

Now let me start off by saying the staff are beyond friendly and accommodating & he food has always been good, but either they changed chefs or they stopped caring. I orders chicken rosa, which in the menus lists a brown sauce, when I had it the first time, I was very dark brown and delicious, this time.. It was a lemon sauce, chicken was over cooked to the point it was like card board! I called they were very nice and understanding & made me Marsala instead.

Unfortunately the bad overshadows the good. Bread was cold and pretty hard, like old bread. We started with the Calamari, which truly was delicious and the highlight of the meal. The center of the eggplant rollatini was not hot enough and unfortunately despite loving eggplant it was really only mediocre. We had one of the specials, some kind of beef dish (I cannot recall the name as it was not memorable) that really was not very pleasant in texture or flavor.

Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed. The service was absolutely terrible. We were seated promptly and given our menus by a waiter. Now, this place is very small, only a few tables that seat six people for the most and a bar in the back. There were around 3 waiters working that night. We were ready to order in under 5 minutes. Unfortunately, no one came to take our orders until 30 minutes later! We were wondering if we had to flag them down to get their attention. There weren't even that many customers in the place anyway. So we decided to let that slide and order anyway. The baked clams were good (which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one), nothing out of this world. But when I received my lasagna, I knew I was never coming to this place again. My lasagna was cooked noodles covered with a spec of meat and cheese, and drowning in tomato sauce. It was fake lasagna.

My wife actually said it was the chunkiest calamari she's had, and loves it. I found the sauce smooth, spicy, and there was a mountain of calamari to dip. I dont know if we take too much when we dip or what, but a tip for myself will be to ask for more sauce next time.We weren't going to get it at first, but we had to try the pasta too and I'm glad we did.

Well we avoided it on this trip and opted for the mozzarella sticks, baked clams, chicken wings, rollatini, chicken tortellini soup, and the rigatoni bolognese.  The wings were soggy, the clams were a little burnt, and the bolognese tasted like vinegar.  I didnt order the bolognese but I could smell it from my seat, the smell was strong and not in a good way. The soup was delicious, and the rollatini also got rave reviews.  Its a shame because you see this place and it looks like its going to be great, you hear the fluent italian and you think it MUST be as good as you thought based on its looks..

Their ceasar salads and baked ziti are both delicious. The only slight qualm I have is their penne with vodka sauce. It's normally served with prosciutto mixed in, but considering I don't eat meat, I opted out of that option. I'm not sure if the prosciutto really makes that much difference in the flavor, but something definitely felt lacking. It's a fairly solid penne, don't get me wrong, just tasted slightly lackluster. Also, someone wrote a review stating that the pasta dishes are ""huge"". I wouldn't say that at all.

Leo’s Casa Calamari,5503,8602 3rd Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,77375,"Ok,I think this place was recently hit by lightening ala Israel. There was a fire and the interior was gutted and transformed into the airport food court it is now. There is a Pizzeria in the front with a bar and dining area behind the frosted glass and wood partition.. This is where the fleecing is done.  It has miss-matched furniture of all shapes and sizes. My favorites are the brushed aluminum new age McDonald's chairs. You know, the ones that hurt your bum. Alot of ""Thoughts"" were put into this place..( like those screaming ones in your head that tell you to do bad things). I get the feeling that people were trying to satisfy alot of peoples different takes on what the place should be. Enough on the Gaudy decor. ....The food..... I like Pizza. Who doesn't? This place makes decent pizza. Its great if you are  NOT in the mood for sweet sauce. I enjoy both salty and sweet with immense pleasure. trust me this review is unbiased.  Yeah decent pizza. That's about it. The Sicilian is the best IMO. The calamari is delicious and i have never had it overcooked or rubbery. DO NOT GET IT FOR TAKE OUT!  It will steam itself into a soggy mess when you finally get it. Only for dine in. Trust me. Ive heard tale they make a good chicken parm. I can neither confirm or deny this.I recently went here with my wife. I ordered hot wings. (suicidal sauce) They were cooked crispy to my liking. Unfortunately, the sauce apparently killed itself on the way to my table. It was more oil than anything. It had no substance and didn't even stick to the wings.Why would I go to a pizzeria/ Italian (Greek?) restaurante and order hot wings? Well, they had them on the menu and they were obviously proud of them judging by the price.. I thought Id give them a chance. Luck was not a lady tonight. We had a waiter of sorts. Young kid, nice kid. Hard worker I'm sure, but they need to show him how to serve wine. I'm not talking about pretentious sommeliers stuff here. Just bring clean glasses to the table. I also ordered the 16 oz Rib eye. It was on the specials list. The waiter didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked.  (Another thing they should tell him). It came medium rare. It was a little chewy. I ate the squashed potato Croquette and left the colorless boiled vegetables to the abyss. They did not look appetizing at all.My wife got a stuffed artichoke that was served in a giant bowl of what looked like dish water. It was smothered in tasteless bread crumbs and a couple of roasted peppers. A wine or butter sauce would have been nice for a broth. She ordered some kind of broccoli Rabe pasta dish. Whatever....Ok This place is trying alot of things all at once. A fancy restaurant, It is not. If you think I was a little hard on the waiter, Here is why... Our bill was 100 dollars. No lie. We could have gone to Ponte Vecchio and sat with Linen on our laps for a few quid more.. Dined like human beings. The bill was just the followup punch to the gut shot.  I would give this place 3-4 stars if it were just a pizza joint operating out of a hole in the wall, but I feel that that rating would be misleading if you were new to the neighborhood.  If you want pizza to order and Ninos is closed, Calamaris is way better than pizza wagon.Do not drop the sack of loot here for these Italianesque entrees when Ponte Vecchio Is just over on 4th.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.0,21.3999996185,"favorites,ones,place,Pizzeria,fleecing,place,Israel,fire,glass,ones,wings,interior,airport food court,dining,bar,area,wood partition,front,furniture,shapes,sizes,age,calamari,kid,head,place,punch,Pizza,things,McDonald's,place,Italian,sauce,chewy,feeling,pizza,Alot,alot,worker,people,takes,peoples,food,waiter,pizza,decor,mood,bum,sauce,sauce,wings.,IMO,review,waiter,wife,table,restaurante,wagon.Do,wine,Luck,oil,this.,table,place,pleasure,mess,dine,tale,liking,way,anything,substance,menu,lady,restaurant,bill,price,sorts,sommeliers stuff,Rib eye,specials list,glasses,Thoughts,Gaudy,Id,alot,things,waiter,place,chicken parm,pasta dish,pizza,Sicilian,broth,broccoli,kind,lie,quid,laps,human beings,Croquette,chance,butter sauce,Greek,rating,artichoke,Ive,Ponte Vecchio,gut shot,pizza joint,hole,wall,neighborhood,sack,loot,entrees,Rabe,Linen,Calamaris,thing,wife,wine,Ninos,stars,abyss,dish water,bowl,couple,peppers,bread crumbs,Italianesque,vegetables,all.My","6,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,3,7,2,7,1,7,6,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,5,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7","0.0752489715815,0.0530007146299,0.0505118221045,0.0318791531026,0.0259226262569,0.022883316502,0.019891615957,0.0190686713904,0.0181596968323,0.0174449905753,0.0169208757579,0.0159748271108,0.0159748271108,0.0158931054175,0.0158931054175,0.0158931054175,0.0158931054175,0.0158931054175,0.0157907418907,0.0157907418907,0.0157907418907,0.0157543662935,0.0142549453303,0.0140391420573,0.0137976016849,0.0110769178718,0.0100422995165,0.01004107669,0.00934428628534,0.00933427270502,0.00905877258629,0.00895974785089,0.00804419908673,0.00779369520023,0.00771357258782,0.00758412200958,0.00753388227895,0.00752264773473,0.00691414810717,0.0068424269557,0.0068424269557,0.0068424269557,0.00682504987344,0.00664765341207,0.00657640630379,0.00597872864455,0.00594808347523,0.00585549324751,0.00559206912294,0.00538573274389,0.00499762548134,0.00496278842911,0.00491037964821,0.0045664254576,0.00455532083288,0.00454924022779,0.0045455195941,0.00442627537996,0.00436636107042,0.00434097880498,0.00423880759627,0.00419274298474,0.00414775125682,0.00408343411982,0.00401193788275,0.00399352051318,0.00399136636406,0.00398731743917,0.0039818007499,0.00398008944467,0.00397843541577,0.00397683400661,0.00397528288886,0.00387285347097,0.00378196965903,0.00368553609587,0.00363765680231,0.00363364559598,0.00362995965406,0.00362765835598,0.00362655008212,0.00356232794002,0.00354956043884,0.00353953102604,0.00352950184606,0.00339549477212,0.00339549477212,0.00339387031272,0.00323625933379,0.00309415720403,0.00308899651282,0.00306499400176,0.00290081114508,0.0027031165082,0.00270243757404,0.00270243757404,0.00269923405722,0.00269862823188,0.00269862823188,0.00269803311676,0.00267420918681,0.00258200708777,0.00253135687672,0.00235398788936,0.00228694593534,0.0022304689046,0.00213246257044,0.00190832221415,0.00186729291454,0.00186689489055,0.00186689489055,0.00186689489055,0.00186689489055,0.00186650350224,0.00186650350224,0.00186650350224,0.00159947620705,0.00159722112585,0.0015468589263,0.00149206549395,0.00135550496634,0.00135480321478,0.00135323242284,0.00132548832335,0.00118614220992,0.00118582556024,0.00118582556024,0.00118551531341,0.00118551531341,0.00118551531341,0.00110464228783,0.00104481971357,0.000701761862729"

But at some point you just have to be honest about your experience. The two stars is generous for the food itself but I rounded up because the cashier was decently nice.Basically, I'm not sure what people are smoking. I got a burrito here, al pastor per the cashier's recommendation, at about 2am on a Saturday. It was enormous, which I was elated about, but it was also wrapped weirdly and cut in half like a wrap. That was the first indicator that something was amiss. Who cuts a burrito in half? Then I picked up my burrito half (??), looked inside of it, and realized it was literally 90 percent rice. For $10 that was a slap in the face. The thing ain't cheap, so don't try to pull one over on the customer by putting a shit ton of rice on a large tortilla. It's honestly insulting. Now, if the rice were amazing, it would be a bit different. But everything, including the rice, was incredibly bland. I felt like I was at a nursing home where they try to keep th sodium down for old people with health issues. When I finally encountered some meat and other fillings, I could barely differentiate anything. It's like they ran out of salt or don't understand the basics of cooking. You put salt on everything, and if you don't, it'll be bland as f**k. That's not to say anything about Mexican spices and techniques which weren't reflected at all.I didn't finish the burrito, because at a certain point--while it was all falling apart in my hands, mind you--I couldn't muster the courage to eat gastronomic cement.I really hope this was just a fluke but I doubt it.

Leo’s Pizza,5505,31-01 36th Ave,Astoria,11106.0,3193,"So not too long ago this place was called Joe's Pizzeria and I don't think that place was there very long. Now it's Leo's and I can't say Leo's is much of a step up. I walked in and there weren't many pies on display. it was pretty much plain, pepperoni, buffalo chicken and I think BBQ chicken slices. I decided to get a buffalo slice and a pepperoni slice. The two slices came out to $6.25. I'm guessing the buffalo slice counted as a specialty slice which are $3.50 and the pepperoni was the same as a grandma/sicilian slice which are $2.75.The buffalo chicken slice was good. It was kinda sweet and spicy at the same time. Something I've never really experienced before. It wasn't bad but it was just different. I felt the slice was somewhat small for $3.50 and if I were truly hungry the two slices I got wouldn't have been enough to fill me. When you get a specialty slice from most pizzerias they're a little more robust. Sure they cost more but they're also more filling. The pepperoni slice was just a disappointment. From the time I sat down to eat I could see all the grease on the surface of the cheese. I'm not one to dab off grease but this was truly excess and I was on my way to work. I dabbed the slice a couple times with a napkin and even held it to the plate vertically so some of the grease could run off. It didn't seem to help at all. Every bite just tasted like i was biting into a pizza dough soaked in grease with cheese. The slice overall just tasted very bland, plain and greasy. Made me wonder if they use beef pepperoni but the slice was so greasy who could tell.

The slice has great consistency...the bottom is crisp and nearly charred and the rest is dense yet chewy, which gives it that nice NY fold.

It's been a neighborhood fixture for the last few years and is one of the decent slice options for the ever changing Astoria scene. This is a local joint through and through, with patrons ranging from high school kids looking for a slice to families sitting down for some serious pie action.To be fair, I haven't always been the biggest proponent of their pizzas. While I am impressed with their variety and happy with the prices ($13-25 for whole pies), the pizza itself is average for me at best. This is somewhat disappointing to me because I appreciate their brick oven and their speedy delivery. The crust is a bit much sometimes and the pizzas have ranged from soggy to messy, depending on delivery care and dining in.I've had solid results with their grilled eggplant pizza, which usually comes in a nice blend of fresh mozzarella. The margarita is not bad and the chicken + bacon seems to be a crowd favorite. Everything else from a subpar grandma's to a disappointing Hawaiian is what I've experienced.Where Leo's has shined brightest for me has been through everything but pizza. Their chicken parm, along with their variety of pasta are among the better things they offer. It doesn't exactly homemade, but the portion size is very hearty and the sauces are well seasoned. I recently enjoyed a good bowl of linguine bolognese, which was chunky full of meat and sauce, with the pasta cooked just right. Avoid the chicken wings, if possible. They may be a popular lunch item and kids option, but the pizza is a better option. Go figure.The guys who run the joint are nice people. The food may not be incredibly memorable, but it's the service that keeps bringing me back.

But it isn't enjoyable. Food should be tasty and enjoyable.And basically the regular slice is just okay with no character. Why? The crust needs work, the crust is too thick and not pizza crust-like.

 I probably should not say this, but with some bakeries I have been to, a pound of cookies is $18+, so it was refreshing to see that they do not gouge their customers.    An hour later, it was time to go, and a slight twinge of separation anxiety came over me.  Bearing in mind that I will be back soon, I longingly looked at the deli one last time before heading back to the car.  I highly recommend Leo's (can you tell)?  Apart from my visit before Christmas, I am looking forward to visiting again in the spring/summer, and taking advantage of their outdoor patio seating behind the bakery.",5.0 star rating,"East Meadow, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,12.1999998093,"Corona,Parking,lunch,OMG OMG Leo,taste,Latticini,greatest,gem,part,distance,bakery,heart,Spaghetti Park,glutton,Shea Stadium,Lemon Ice King,deli,pasta store,doors,sandwich,parking situation,couple,counter,credit cards,sandwich,sandwich,sandwiches,bakery,tears,sandwich,mom,coffees,one,deli,friends,friend,mozzarella,mozzarella,doors,boyfriend,Mama,pound,biscottis,cappuccinos,quality,service,business,owners,roast beef,balsamic vinegar,red peppers,turkey,eyes,bakeries,pizza rustica,half,pound,goods,biscotti,twinge,customers,cookies,bite,bakery,Man,deli,advantage,separation anxiety,mind,car,visit,patio seating,Bearing,much,pound,rainbow slices,slice,Leo,city,heaven,cannoli,tiramisu,Christmas,cappuccinos","2,7,4,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,2,7,2,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,2,7,7,7,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,4,7","0.226642295718,0.169787660241,0.048194937408,0.0395037196577,0.0250468719751,0.0240198690444,0.0236414130777,0.0191990733147,0.0191990733147,0.0191990733147,0.0167594309896,0.0149117168039,0.0142969954759,0.0123763186857,0.0113826040179,0.0113826040179,0.00909494701773,0.00900665391237,0.00829947926104,0.00762708252296,0.00727636367083,0.00726216984913,0.00723908934742,0.00723908934742,0.00700975907966,0.0070013012737,0.00690555665642,0.00661002798006,0.00642905198038,0.0063768341206,0.00636925082654,0.00613663345575,0.00579496473074,0.00558894639835,0.00557880941778,0.00557880941778,0.00557207595557,0.00557207595557,0.00556593574584,0.00519416946918,0.00513535924256,0.005072128959,0.00507102906704,0.00507102906704,0.00488765770569,0.00488765770569,0.0048811356537,0.0048811356537,0.00487524317577,0.00487524317577,0.00487524317577,0.00487524317577,0.00486493203789,0.00445713289082,0.00444383267313,0.00444019911811,0.00414954032749,0.00391157018021,0.00377416540869,0.00364537118003,0.00329528772272,0.00329528772272,0.00324268802069,0.00308055360802,0.00288015184924,0.00286449026316,0.00268549774773,0.00228028418496,0.00227926974185,0.00227926974185,0.00227734260261,0.00227734260261,0.00216652988456,0.00182557152584,0.00181990466081,0.00165518734138,0.0014954713406,0.00149288482498,0.0014496910153,0.00144883582834,0.00144801905844,0.00144801905844,0.0013478907058,0.000716938637197"

Leo’s Latticini Mama’s,5506,46-02 104th St,Corona,11368.0,197714,"I wrote a Review about Mama's so many years ago I thought an update was due. I can tell you the exact day I first stepped into Mama's in September of 1987. I was a rookie cop and waaayyy off post; taken there by a dear friend Louis Luciani; a good man in his own right.I immediately fell in love with Mama and her three daughters; Irene, Carmella and Marie. Irene ran the counter for the most part, Marie was in the kitchen cooking and Carmella helped out with both while also helping her husband, Oronzo, make their very own, delicious, fresh pasta (linguini, ravioli, red sauce, Bolognese sauce, and so much more).There was Met paraphanalia all over the place and every TV Star, Didnitary and Politician dropped by. There was not a NY Met, or his wife, who didn't come by at least once a month for some delicious food.Well, fast forward 30 years ago (almost to the day) and I was in there on 7/21/2017. I had not been in there for almost two years due to some medical issues and truly missed my friends. Upon arrival I received a warm welcome by Irene, who retrieved Marie from the Kitchen to say hello to me and no sooner than that I was sitting in their next-door bakery enjoying the famous 'Moma's Special' - and man, oh man was it good.I am writing to report that nothing, I do mean nothing, has changed. Though Mama has passed on. I am also happy to report that since her death they have renamed the street in front of her Deli, they renamed the Park down the block after her and they even renamed the grade school after her; with a beautiful plaque placed on the front entranceway.

Leo’s Latticini Mama’s,5506,46-02 104th St,Corona,11368.0,18533,"I don't understand the hype about this place. The sandwiches are as thin as can be. I've been here multiple times and pray that the previous time was just a mistake but I think this is the last straw. They always disappoint when I open my sandwiches and see slivers of whatever you order. They go cheap on the cold cut meats!. Let's dive into the details:Place - not ideal for parking because the area is congested all the time. If you do come here by car, plan accordingly. Also keep in mind they have a bakery/cafe section on the block. Be sure to go into the one in the corner for the average sandwiches. Service - average. Food - I got the mamas special because hey...it's mamas special! BUT be warned, they pre make these god knows how long in advance. That's a no no I'm my book. I want my sandwiches fresh. Like I said above, they do not pack it with much. You'll be hungry if you're a normal sized person. The taste of the sandwich was good though! I also tried the super Italian - I would recommend this over the Mama's special because instead of it being pre made they take the cold cuts that was pre cut from a container and then make your sandwich....yeah...but it wasn't a bad sandwich. Overall, the sandwiches are not bad but for the money you can get better elsewhere.

Leo’s Latticini Mama’s,5506,46-02 104th St,Corona,11368.0,55,"Visiting the store is an experience in and of itself. The shop is pretty small, but the ladies behind the counter are super sweet and very warm and friendly. This place is super old school and is more commonly known as just Mama's or Mama's of Corona, which is the name of their shop at Citi Field which has been at Shea/Citi Field for a number of years. I originally heard of this place from a show where Chef Mario Batali was showcasing Italian American delis and this was one of the places that they had featured. I really like how the employees wear personalized Mets jerseys that say Mama's on the back. Also, the bakery a few stores down is owned by the same people so you can take your sandwiches and eat at the bakery.The food:Mama's Special- Prosciuttini, Salami, Mozzarella with mushrooms and peppers. OMG the name of the store and the word special? Oh yeah, it has to be good. I thought this sandwich was great. The bread is sturdy enough to withhold the sandwich but has a nice, soft texture and has a nice crunch from the bread. All the ingredients blend so perfectly together especially with the mozz. I really enjoyed the mushrooms and peppers. This is a must get, it's a classic Italian American sandwich. yelp.com/user_local_phot…  Chicken alla Crema- with mushroom, peppers and mozzarella. The chicken is so tender and flavorful, then there is some type of crunchy pork product on top, think it might be some kind of ham, but it adds nice flavor and a slight crunch and it also has a layer of a breading layer than adds a wonderful richness. The homemade mozz is perfection, it is slightly salty when you eat it plain, but it is so perfectly seasoned and textured when you eat it in the sandwich. I thought this was great. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Artichoke Antipasto- I thought this was made well, the artichoke was perfectly tender and the olives and carrots offered a nice textural contrast. The dressing worked well, it had a nice flavor to tie everything together with a nice pop from the vinegar. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Rainbow Cookie and Cannoli- This is from the bakery a few stores down since it's the same owner. I thought the Rainbow Cookie was pretty straight forward, but I thought the Cannoli was excellent. It was super crunchy and the the filling had such a wonderful creamy texture and a really nice and not overpowering mascarpone flavor. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",3,0,0.600000023842,15.5,"shop,name,store,one,chicken,experience,sandwich,place,sandwich,shop,old school,perfection,counter,Cannoli- This,show,ladies,places,Mama,Mama's Special- Prosciuttini,Mario Batali,jerseys,Corona,Crema,place,dressing,employees,sandwiches,bread,number,Italian American,stores,Mozzarella,store,mozz,bakery,mushrooms,peppers,bread,peppers,mushrooms,mozzarella,food,olives,name,mushroom,peppers,crunch,texture,delis,type,Shea/Citi Field,back,people,word,ingredients,artichoke,ham,top,pork product,Mets,flavor,stores,carrots,contrast,vinegar,pop,everything,Salami,OMG,bakery,mascarpone flavor,texture,forward,filling,owner,Rainbow Cookie,sandwich,Artichoke Antipasto,flavor,breading layer,layer,crunch,richness","2,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,5,1,2,1,1,1,6,2,7,7,6,1,7,6,7,1,2,7,2,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,7,6,4,7,1,5,2,7,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0957040786743,0.0795296505094,0.0673351585865,0.0542184151709,0.0527221113443,0.0476040020585,0.0418580956757,0.0280836168677,0.0269110314548,0.0256919004023,0.0226668864489,0.0216876845807,0.0183877553791,0.0178372506052,0.0177298299968,0.017263488844,0.0168616641313,0.0146627826616,0.012937258929,0.0126525517553,0.0119517175481,0.0108505235985,0.0095409732312,0.00876030605286,0.00866922270507,0.00809460133314,0.00783072598279,0.0071618668735,0.00699891429394,0.00677151745185,0.00633510341868,0.00633510341868,0.0063227484934,0.00628666067496,0.00588630652055,0.00588630652055,0.00588630652055,0.00584834534675,0.00583485560492,0.00576141756028,0.00573074724525,0.00545402243733,0.00544348405674,0.00534377619624,0.00532469293103,0.00532469293103,0.00531968614087,0.00531968614087,0.00521124340594,0.00518580339849,0.00473762722686,0.00469565065578,0.0046848161146,0.00467567471787,0.00464897416532,0.00430838437751,0.00423422036693,0.00423422036693,0.00423422036693,0.00411846349016,0.00396412191913,0.00366236874834,0.00315664429218,0.00315664429218,0.00315459235571,0.00315459235571,0.00315459235571,0.00277383089997,0.0027684152592,0.00274304114282,0.00273987930268,0.00249198940583,0.00232419651002,0.00232288683765,0.00218270299956,0.00217383750714,0.00199162098579,0.00186865136493,0.00174373143818,0.00158592290245,0.00158592290245,0.00158592290245,0.00138743978459"

The fresh mozz was refreshing and acted well to counter balance the saltiness of the Italian meat. The earthy mushrooms were your standard Italian style mushrooms in a jar. The roasted red peppers really gave life to the sandwich  by bringing a sweet component to the flavor profile. I loved the sandwich but what makes the experience awesome is the outdoor seating area hidden in the back of the connected bakery next door. The miniature oasis is an escape from the surrounding urban neighborhood. The best thing about the space is the old school fountain which brings a zen like calming feeling while I chomped on my sandwich. The sandwich is about 8 bucks and its big enough to eat in two sittings. I really liked the bakery too. The smell of fresh coffee permeates the whole air space.

Leo’s Latticini Mama’s,5506,46-02 104th St,Corona,11368.0,2104,"Leo's Latticini Mama's is one of the borough's treasures for all things Italian. In addition to featuring quality meats and Italian products, they also have an outstanding dessert selection, and they happen to have some of the best sandwiches anywhere. Combine all of that with outstanding service and solid prices, it isn't hard to fathom why I make it a point to stop by whenever I'm in the area.The place is clean, organized, yet incredibly old school. The store is sectioned off to various areas from the garlic dangling salad and pasta area to the counter spots where cheese and hanging meats reign supreme together. The smell in the store is strangely aromatic, perhaps reminiscent of an Italian grandmother's kitchen.For a lot of folks coming to Mama's, a big draw are their signature sandwiches. One of their most popular, the Mama's Special ($8) is a nice smattering of meats with fresh mozzarella and spread. I also have high regard for their very tasty roasted turkey, fresh chunks of mozzarella, and pesto spread. ($9.50). The ultimate is the Super Italian, which is a stacking of prosciutto, cappicola, and more fresh mozzarella. On occasion if the sandwich seems stingy or flimsy, don't be afraid to ask for more meat / cheese to make the sandwich to your liking (within reason of course).Beyond the sandwiches, there is always an opportunity to try their hot foods and cold foods, which are changed out daily. From meatballs on Wednesdays to eggplant parm on Fridays, there is never a dull choice for lunch.

I made it through my front door with good intentions, but it wasn't my fault, he actually said, ""I'll eat it later maybe.""

Leo’s Latticini Mama’s,5506,46-02 104th St,Corona,11368.0,197869,"Welcoming to everyone, but particularly a great experience for Mets fans, Mama's is one of those places that you have to experience over and over again. To me, it's one of those places that you can't believe is that amazing when you go way too long between visits. My girlfriend and I try to go here before Mets games. . . we grab a Mama's Special ($3 cheaper here than at the stadium) and take it to the bakery to eat in or in the backyard. That's the true tease; seeing and smelling all of these wonderful baked goods while eating your sandwich. You would think that would make you rush through your sandwich, but it's something to behold. The flavors are awesome, and the bread is so tasty with that soft inside and that tasty crust that you'll find yourself picking at just to taste it by itself in between bites.So after you eat your sandwich and play some stomach Tetris to get yourself ready for some baked goods, you're treated to a plethora of Italian treats. Cannolis, pastries, cakes, cupcakes, pies, cookies and more are spread out in front of you to make you feel like the proverbial kid in a candy store. And the best part about it? It's all SUPER CHEAP. My girlfriend and I had a sandwich, soda, water, huge brownie with about a cup of fudgy frosting on top, two small cannolis (one chocolate covered) and a chocolate mousse cheesecake slice for $20. That'll make you happy even before you taste anything. And the cannolis? Best I've had, including my own. And the shells here, often forgotten by most bakeries that have cannolis, are top shelf. Perfect flavor with that tasty hint of vanilla. Even if you can't make it to the store before the game, you'll have plenty to enjoy at the stadium with ready sandwiches and cannolis and cupcakes.

The fresh mozzarella was so good and melted so well on top of the well seasoned eggplant, the eggplants were very thinly sliced, fried to perfection and was super flavorful, it didn't tasted greasy and every bite was blasting with flavor and texture.   The marinara sauce was fresh tasting and you can taste that it is not from a can because there is certain sweetness to it!! OH man, I don't think I ever had a better eggplant parm in my life.This time around I was going to get the same thing but unfortunately they didn't have it so I decided to go for what was recommended on Yelp- Roasted turkey with fresh mozz and sweet hot pepper and mushroom.  I'm usually not a big fan of turkey because they can taste very dry and hard to digest but it's different at Mama's! Here the turkey is very juicy, they put fresh mozz on top of it and also sweet pepper and mushroom.  The whole thing is then drizzle with gravy... the sandwich is far from dry... OMG I thought I wouldn't have any other favorite other than the eggplant parm but looks like I just found another go-to at Mama's.  btw did I mention they don't skip on their meat and mozz? amazing!!Price: Awesome! Mama's is super famous in the area but what's great about them is they didn't raise their because of that and I love them for it!! Your average sandwich will come to around $7- $9, consider it's quality and size, this is a GREAT DEAL!Overall: What can I say about Mama's, wonderful people, awesome food, great price.

Came here, not really understanding where the entrance was, but finally made our way through the entrance, which had no windows. I think that was what threw us off. When we entered, I was stunned at the sheer amount of space, including the front bar area, which even had a few booths lining the sides. Then we were whisked into the main dining room, where the open kitchen was. The decor is rustic, with a hint of modern art lining the ceilings. A pretty nice homey touch, and elegant at the same time.The menu had a big number of choices, ranging from the dips, to the antipasti, and pizzas. We figured we should try a little from each part of the menu, antipasti notwithstanding. First off, I have to say the sheep's milk ricotta with hot honey and garlic is insanely good. We kept asking for more complimentary bread to dip into the ricotta, and we were almost full before the entrees came. Thankfully, we left some space for the rest of the food we got: OG Pizza (pepperoni, nduja, Fresno chili), spicy sea urchin spaghetti, and Chicken ""Rosalina"" for two. The OG pizza was really great, and had a nice crispy crust. The spicy uni spaghetti came with a decent amount of uni, and the spaghetti had a nice firm chew to it. The Chicken Rosalina was delicious, and there wasn't a dry bite throughout the chicken, which was unheard of. The 4 of us plowed through everything, even though we had already eaten so much bread and ricotta, and we were full to bursting at the end. Nonetheless, we still ordered two desserts: the Sicilian pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, and the chocolate budino with hazelnut gelato and sea salt. Both were very good, and the olive oil taste was very subtle and delicious.Our server was very attentive throughout the meal, and gave us good recommendations for drinks, and what would be enough to feed our 4 hungry stomachs. Prices are on the expensive side, especially for Brooklyn, but everything was of top-notch quality and execution, so I'll say it's definitely worth the price.  Will definitely be back to try that suckling pig. Hoo-wee. A neighboring table ordered it, and the smell was intoxicating. Made me really crave it, even though it was well after our meal and we were super full. So yeah, it will be an easy decision to go back to try that, not to mention the many other things on the menu.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,56001,"Stayed at the hotel where this restaurant is located, and was sufficiently happy with the stay - as room, service, etc., were all very good.This restaurant, though, I'm stretching in giving it 3-stars.I went towards the end of the night, and as such service was spotty, at best. My iced tea never saw a refill, by way of example.The food was overly ""inventive"", in my estimation.Let's start with the eggplant caponata appetizer. It was a very odd mix of flavors and temperatures. First it was served warm. Second it was very sweet, with an odd vinegar-type flavor component. And, third it was a mess to eat. All in all I found this take on caponata to be a MAJOR fail, and it was priced excessively expensively to be such a disaster.

You come into the main dining room and forget you walked in from the streets of NYc. It feels like a restaurant that's in the Four Seasons. Great open space and beautiful decor plus an exotic feel. You're  just waiting for some one to open a window that's looking out to Carribean water. The food was stellar.  We had the Tuna Crudo, Wood Fired Cabbage and the ricotta plate to start. We then shared the pesto pasta. All dishes ranged from $12 - $20. We werent eating meat but two guys next to us ordered the Duck and it was massive and looked delicious.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,197825,"Updating review. Was invited back for another chance and received great service. Sometimes bad service can be a one off night. Great food here. Cool atmosphere. They changed my mind with excellent hospitality First: I made a reservation for 9:30pm. Waited till 10pm. Was seated in the bar area by the exit. I asked the group of 4 hostesses if we could be seated in the main dining area because we made a reservation, and was told it would take quite awhile for the main dining area. They also admitted the bar area was for walk-ins. I was having to argue so I asked for the manager. Manager was nice and sat us in the main dining area within 3 minutes. Food: wine list was extensive and decently priced. Honey Ricotta was amazing. Salad was good. Clam bucatini was very good. Cherry desert was meh. Service: Awful. I think we talked to 4 different waiters so wasn't sure who was responsible. Guy in a suit took our wine order, nice and professional and explained the wine well. Our next guy didn't know the menu. I asked him about an appetizer and he clearly had no clue. Said ""you tell me"". And started rattling off buzzwords from the description. He poured basically the whole wine bottle into our glasses out of laziness I'm assuming. Our salad appetizer and side dishes sat on our table while we ate our entrees. Very odd.  Overall I should have expected this experience. They are in the William Vale hotel and its ""trendy"" to be there. Customer service isn't their first priority. Although the manager was very customer friendly. They know they will keep filling the seats no matter what because it's cool to be there.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,197794,"Brought my mom and my kids for Sunday brunch (after saying I was going to try Leuca for like, ever), and boy, I was not disappointed. The first pleasant surprise I got was that we found parking right outside, so the walk, while dragging a 4 year old and 1 year old, was not the hellish march it usually would be in such an upscale area.The interior was absolutely beautiful, and my mom (who once worked at a restaurant) was commenting how even though the kitchen is open, giving you a view of all the chefs working in sync with one another (in an absolutely pristine environment), that you can't hear them talking, and neither can you smell the grease that would normally be floating around from all the cooking--this is a true testament to the architecture and interior design.The mixed juice that my mom ended up getting (pity we were both driving as I would have loved to try the cocktails) was wonderful and not overpoweringly sweet. And, despite it containing ginger (something that can often ruin the taste for me if they're a little heavy handed with the herb), the flavor did not overpower and was amazingly sublime.I don't think there was anything we ordered that I wouldn't order again--We had the Sheep's milk ricotta with honey and roasted garlic (with my one year old also kept on shoving into her mouth)--the contrast of the creamy ricotta, the fragrant garlic, whatever the crispy greens were on top (um, this was amazing by the way) and the syrupy honey called for some crusty bread which we eagerly smeared it upon.Tuna crudo--I am a fiend for fish and even more so for it rare or raw, carpaccio style, tartare, what have you--fresh and thinly sliced, with just enough herbs and tang to make me feel like I'm biting into the last bit of summer.Lemon ricotta pancakes. My mother, who normally hates pancakes, cleaned the plate with none to spare and said she may just have to start eating them if they were all made like this (I am a bit upset I didn't get to take any home for the husband, who is crazy about pancakes, to try). Fluffy, with a bit of crunch from the pine nuts balanced it perfectly.Pizza was originally ordered for the kids but how could I leave it alone when it smelled so amazing? I ate three slices before even realizing that I should be waiting for what I was most anticipating--the black pasta. Guys, I love seafood. I'm obsessed with it. But it's so easy to get wrong--shrimp and calamari can, with very little effort, turn into inedible fishy rubber bands and so I often choose to ignore it when I see it tossed with pasta--but my mom said she's had it before and it's worth trying.I actually, because I had filled up on those dratted pizzas (why must you be so delicious), took it home with me and am eating it as I'm typing this review (this was the last straw) because my eyes rolled into the back of my head with the first bite. The soggy penne and meatballs I had made two days ago that's still sitting in the fridge...? Yeah, that's going in the garbage tonight. Or my husband's lunch tomorrow 'cause it's not gonna take up prime real estate in my stomach.Edited To Add: Oh, also for the environmentally conscious (I'm big on homesteading and permaculture), the paper bags and compostable take out boxes are on point.",5.0 star rating,"Bay Shore, NY",4,0,0.20000000298,6.90000009537,"mom,fiend,surprise,straw,juice,kids,brunch,boy,Leuca,chefs,interior,Sheep,walk,area.,parking,mother,grease,husband,Pizza,bread,something,pizzas,Fluffy,kitchen,testament,cocktails,interior,sync,view,pity,another,restaurant,environment,cooking,architecture,design.,ricotta,home,anything,ricotta pancakes,bit,pancakes,pancakes,honey,garlic,garlic,honey,herb,milk ricotta,herbs,tartare,taste,flavor,ginger,mouth,contrast,way,Tuna crudo,fish,carpaccio style,tang,none,plate,pasta,pasta,back,eyes,review,head,rubber bands,paper bags,Lemon,real estate,homesteading,husband,bite,penne,meatballs,fridge,garbage,point,permaculture,compostable,stomach.,cause,lunch,Guys,boxes,greens,bit,kids,seafood,crunch,pine nuts,slices,calamari,shrimp,effort","1,7,7,7,7,1,4,1,7,1,7,5,4,7,7,1,7,1,6,6,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.50777477026,0.320098906755,0.0151861598715,0.0126501386985,0.00943655148149,0.00847322400659,0.00742094218731,0.00742094218731,0.00729586416855,0.00496489461511,0.00422374391928,0.0037247792352,0.00353894894943,0.00353894894943,0.00353894894943,0.00351875135675,0.00344212213531,0.00295188161545,0.0027313393075,0.00231364765204,0.00231364765204,0.00178347982001,0.00171037379187,0.00165625661612,0.00161482649855,0.00151572120376,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00135238515213,0.00114142394159,0.00110208522528,0.00108470267151,0.00104452262167,0.00104452262167,0.00104072107933,0.00104072107933,0.00103819079231,0.00103819079231,0.00103819079231,0.00103819079231,0.00103819079231,0.00103136734106,0.000950044370256,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000908331072424,0.000831200159155,0.000828174233902,0.000828174233902,0.000712525914423,0.000699941068888,0.000612362113316,0.000612362113316,0.000612362113316,0.000612362113316,0.000612362113316,0.000579956395086,0.000492033432238,0.000491810205858,0.000482800416648,0.000482800416648,0.000423922174377,0.000423356046667,0.000423356046667,0.000423356046667,0.000422844605055,0.000422378216172,0.000422378216172,0.000422378216172,0.000422378216172,0.000422378216172,0.000422378216172,0.000404238235205,0.000396424147766,0.000393350375816,0.000340010155924,0.0003092342522,0.000279823841993,0.000270527292741,0.000270527292741,0.00026990234619,0.000268517702352,0.000268517702352,0.000268517702352"

REALLY? so i have to spend $1,260 on food & then another $1,740 on beverages? what if we're all recovering alcoholics? kind of ballsy to tell someone in order to come to their restaurant you have to spend X amount of dollars, just saying.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,11545,"First impressions...why does Williamsburg need another Italian restaurant? But me being the Italian food lover I am, I couldn't resist. Plus with it being heavy on the southern Italian I was all in. FYI southern Italian food is 10x better than the north. We had:Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Hot Honey & Garlic (really amazing, pretty close to how its made in Italy)Smoky Eggplant with Basil & Onion CondimentoSmoked Beets, Pistachio, Ricotta SalataClassic - Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil  (really good Neapolitan style pizza)Burrata Mezzaluna, Marjoram, Pecorino RagusanaI'm not going to go too much into depth about each dish but everything was really amazing, rich, and, tasty. The portions are smaller so you may need to order two dishes, but wow everything was fantastic. Every dish is heavy on flavor and herbs and you can't go wrong with that. Someone mentioned the food was salty, however if anyone has visited Italy most of the dishes are salty. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing here, but that comes down to what you like also. Service was fantastic and very attentive. Wine list is really heavy on the southern wine (as it should be) and not terribly over priced. I really enjoyed their selection, as it's not typical of other restaurants for the most part. The restaurant is pretty sex inside. Dark and romantic...if that's what you like. From someone who eats a lot of Italian food, I highly recommend it. However, if you're old school like my Italian father in law and like massive dishes and don't care about how a place looks inside then you might not like it here. Bottom line go.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,66125,"Leuca is well worth a visit. The bar area is large, plush and comfortable. The restaurant itself verges on an open kitchen that you can observe if you wish. The service was friendly and mostly efficient (but not entirely, as they neglected to pour our wine until we had to ask them, as the bottle was in a chiller some distance away).The only real complaint is the absence of any real light. The place is so dimly lit that you need a flashlight to actually see the food, and if you don't have a light with you, the menus may well be undecipherable. The lack of lighting is the reason I deducted a star from this review.(Small rant here: I just do not get what seems to be the current fashion in menu design: small, sometimes even tiny, print in a color that blends into the menu color. It makes reading the menu a real task, and it usually means that you will miss something, if not everything. It is as bad or worse than having a waitperson recite eight or nine dishes that are not on the menu. Why do restaurants do this? Why not have a menu that is readable to everyone, regardless of age, and print out a list of the specials if there are more than one or two?) The food is excellent, at least what we had. We started with the smoky eggplant dip, accompaned by the good bread, and we thoroughly enjoyed the rich, creamy dip. It made us want to try the other dips they offer, but that will have to wait. Next were the smoked beet salad and the fire roasted cabbage, two random appetizers. Both were not only amazingly good, they were generously portioned. We were unable to finish either, as we wanted enough room to enjoy the main courses.My wife had the burrata mezzaluna pasta and I tried the steak vesuvius after our waiter told us the cut they use is the hanger steak, among my favorites. We both felt we could return just to have the burrata mezzaluna dish again. It is impossible to describe the dish, as we could only see it with the light from our cellphone. It was luscious, perfectly done pasta with stringy cheese on top, a delight to eat.The hanger steak was memorable (and I am remembering it right now), but I'd probably order something else next time, mainly to try some of the other dishes. The kitchen knows how to create top notch Italian fare, and it would be a serious error not to try some of their other dishes.Although the prices are reasonable (until you get to the main courses), they can add up pretty quickly. But it would be mean-spirited to deny the place the opportunity to make a profit.

The atmosphere is gorgeous, food was delicious but we had to wait for more than hour to have our dishes ready.

We order a salad to share for the table and then each their own dish, being the chicken for two, the steak( amazing) fish bass and the mushroom pasta ( the portion a bit small).

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,49107,"Went here for brunch-date with my husband, after reading all of the great reviews.  It's a very beautiful restaurant.  The decor is really beautiful.  Each room seems to have it's own theme...  The front room had an open, Le Pain Quotidien-sort of feel.  Families and children were happily eating and chattering away.  I liked that it was family friendly.Though far from full, the front room was starting to fill up.  I found the hostess to be very considerate and mindful of her restaurant - she asked us if we'd like to go into the back room as it was quieter.  This room was beautiful in its own, different way.  Almost like another restaurant entirely.  Though also a large room, it was intimate and cozy, with warm wood tones everywhere, sofas and armchairs, and creative lighting.  I could see even more rooms beyond this one, with even quirkier personality - bright with water and little fish painted on the walls!  Certainly a place with lots to look at.We found the service to be spot on.  Waiters frequently came by to fill up our water, even when it wasn't emptied.  Someone was always close by in case we needed anything.  They were quick to clean up.I even liked that we could see into the kitchen and watch the chef and his team at work.Food-wise, presentation was again beautiful.  Each platter that came out was like a mini-work of art.  Prices were fair and reasonable too!I just wish the food tasted as good as it looked.  Perhaps it was this chef's particular tastes, but we just didn't click.   After reading all the rave reviews about the sheep's milk ricotta with hot honey and garlic, I really wanted to try that.  It was entirely luck with this dish... one bite was creamy and interesting.  Another was strange, and had a weird, unexpected and jarring spiciness to it.  I don't know if it was meant to be that way, as no one else mentioned any sort of spiciness in their reviews, but it really threw us off.  We ordered a cappuccino and latte along with the brunch.  The sugar, though presented in a fancy manner of little balls that you could submerge and mix into your coffee, was ineffective and wouldn't breakdown in the coffee until the end, resulting in undersweetened coffee in the beginning, and oversweetened coffee by the end of your drink.  Unfortunately just unpleasant overall...The french toast, though beautiful, was also bland.  I thought the bread itself was lovely and light, but it just seemed to be missing something to make it memorable.  I tried mixing with the toppings - raisins, cream, and syrup, but it just didn't come together.  My husband got the eggs benedict, but it was more spinach than anything else.  He felt overpowered the dish.I really would have loved to have rated this higher.  I found so many things perfect about this place - so much attention to detail when it came to decor, service, and presentation... fair pricing... a convenient location (hotel, bowling, and the brewery right there!).  But it was the food that left me wanting more. =\",3.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",4,0,0.20000000298,19.8999996185,"husband,restaurant,all,reviews,room,room,room,luck,food,decor,hostess,Families,family,theme,feel,children,chef,platter,front room,food,water,tastes,back room,room,Le Pain Quotidien,bread,something,Waiters,restaurant,restaurant,way,rooms,reviews,wood tones,everywhere,Someone,presentation,attention,way,Another,hotel,lighting,water,service,place,chef,bite,dish,spiciness,no one,armchairs,sofas,walls,fish,lots,case,team,kitchen,up.,art,mini-work,anything,milk ricotta,honey,garlic,sheep,french toast,balls,light,work.Food-wise,spinach,drink,syrup,toppings - raisins,cream,anything,dish.,service,decor,place,presentation,pricing,eggs benedict,Prices,detail,location,brewery,bowling,more.,coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,things,reviews,sugar,spiciness,sort,brunch,end,end,latte,cappuccino,beginning,manner","1,2,7,5,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,6,7,1,2,2,7,2,5,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,5,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,6,7,7,4,7,4,7,7,7,7","0.23280711472,0.0896241366863,0.0474825613201,0.0386092811823,0.0263618603349,0.0243769269437,0.0241395793855,0.0228485967964,0.0214486382902,0.0204365458339,0.0193620361388,0.0165552273393,0.0165230389684,0.0145660117269,0.0145250102505,0.0144915953279,0.0131591679528,0.012415475212,0.0122790038586,0.0112161235884,0.0107674207538,0.0099997734651,0.00871190521866,0.00867686606944,0.00861060898751,0.00802849140018,0.00730519369245,0.00728341564536,0.00693483790383,0.00691527174786,0.00629873154685,0.00608034990728,0.00574110494927,0.0054974234663,0.0054974234663,0.00504570966586,0.0050415857695,0.00489070639014,0.00471039861441,0.00459511578083,0.00441747019067,0.0042421692051,0.00423749396577,0.00423319777474,0.00423319777474,0.00421288888901,0.00402285298333,0.0038503613323,0.00384809169918,0.00384592451155,0.00371162220836,0.00371162220836,0.00370753114112,0.00370753114112,0.00370377185754,0.00369706004858,0.00369403720833,0.00369403720833,0.00369403720833,0.00369119970128,0.00369119970128,0.0035836591851,0.00337084941566,0.00337084941566,0.00337084941566,0.00337084941566,0.00299741211347,0.00287987221964,0.00286747817881,0.00274832826108,0.0026704929769,0.00251117395237,0.00250756810419,0.00250756810419,0.00250756810419,0.0019834083505,0.00198255595751,0.00198173173703,0.00198173173703,0.00198173173703,0.00198173173703,0.00198093405925,0.00184879580047,0.00182593811769,0.00173373601865,0.0017330381088,0.0017330381088,0.0017330381088,0.00173236185219,0.00148970237933,0.00148970237933,0.00148970237933,0.00148970237933,0.00145167682786,0.00138548214454,0.00131518696435,0.00126008153893,0.00126008153893,0.00125940155704,0.00125874963123,0.00125874963123,0.00110176834278,0.00110176834278,0.00110119802412,0.00110119802412"

Overall, our meal here was okay but not amazing for the price. It's served in a sharing-style, which was fine by us. Food came out hot. In order of how much we liked the food we got: 1) fennel salad, local apple, pecorino ($14)2) tuna crudo, green olives, chili, crispy farro ($16) 3) cauliflower fritto, meyer lemon aioli ($9)4) steak vesuvius ($32, with tomatoes, peppers, and onions) 5) artichokes alla gricia, duck egg, guanciale ($16)6) spicy sea urchin spaghetti ($24)We were both definitely underwhelmed by the spicy sea urchin spaghetti that had looked so good on instagram. But the fennel salad was heaven, a delightful blend of sweet, crunchy, salty, and melt-in-your-mouth good. And the tuna crudo was exquisite, also wonderfully paired to create an amazing taste sensation. My husband wasn't into the heavy breading on the cauliflower, but I liked it, especially paired with the delectable lemony mayo dip. Also, the bread and olive oil brought out for the table was super delicious and a great way to start the meal. The wine list is entirely Italian. As we aren't that familiar with the Italian wines they had, we weren't sure what to get and described our preferences to our waitress, who ultimately recommended two wines we really didn't like. I drank mine, but my husband was unhappy enough that he asked to change after his tasting and was much happier with the second one he got, thanks to the woman who came by with the tasting.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,65510,"I would love to say I enjoyed everything but I really loved only the spicy sea urchin spaghetti dish. Also tried the tuna crudo, the OG pizza, the burrata ravioli, the lobster, the tomahawk, and finished with the pistachio cake which ended the dinner nicely. The hotel that houses the restaurant is unique and looks very pretty with lights around the trees (it is holiday season after all). I have to say my taste buds are spoiled. Living in NYC, I have the opportunity to try many different kinds of food and even dishes with similar ingredients prepared differently. There was nothing at all that was wrong. I just felt some of the dishes were average compared to other restaurants of the same caliber.I would definitely recommend the sea urchin pasta dish and the lobster dish and pistachio cake as they all pleased my senses with unique flavors. The tuna and the tomahawk were leaning towards slightly bland for me. The tomahawk had a lot (but I guess acceptable) amounts of fat which made chewing a little difficult. The OG pizza met my standards although I was hoping to bite into a surprise. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I feel the ingredients listed (Pepperoni, Nduja, Fresno Chili) are becoming typical now. I was impressed though there's a lot of wood-grilling which you can smell outside the restaurant. The burrata ravioli simply did nothing for me. It is interesting though you can feel the burrata burst in your mouth as you bite into the ravioli and the burrata was fresh tasting but I did not enjoy the accompaniment- would've preferred burrata on its own.But oooh the spicy sea urchin spaghetti - the sea urchin is mixed into the perfectly cooked spaghetti and has a hint of heat/spice that gave it a tasty creamy, simple yet complex flavor. I've had sea urchin with pasta before but never was it blended into the sauce like this dish. The lobster has a kick too (almost Cajun flavor) and was very easy to eat as the meat is prepared is outside and placed back in its shell. Nice preparation and nice amount of meat. The pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream was brilliant. The cake on its own is scrumptious and is heavenly when paired with the ice cream.

For food, we ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to share between us- delicious and not terribly heavy! My friend ordered the polenta waffles and they looked great, but she left a bit on her plate (could've been the hangover haha).My dad and his girlfriend ordered the eggs al forno (basically baked eggs) and both finished their dishes completely! My dad also really liked the side of bread that came with it. The Bloody Mary i had could've had a little more vodka in it and less ice, but maybe that was a good thing. I ordered the burrata pasta because I'm a sucker for anything w burrata... and this dish was very light, but not terribly flavorful. It missed some salt or spice or something with a pop!

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,31202,"Leuca has remained bookmarked for the longest time due to its location in Brooklyn. However, when I finally decided to venture over, it was worth the trek. First off, the venue - I don't know why, but for some reason, I thought this place would be small. However, immediately after entering, I was shocked to see that there was another room with plenty of seating. Also worth noting that the seats are SO comfortable. You can literally take a nap after eating here. Perfect location for a date. We ordered the pesto malfadini (the reason why I had bookmarked this place) and the black shells. While waiting, they bought over quite possibly one of the best bread baskets I've had. Highly recommend you go right around opening time as the bread legitimately just comes out of the oven at that time. Obviously, it was amazing - so soft on the inside and the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. This immediately won my heart because I love good bread. Shamelessly, I had to ask for a second round when our pastas arrived. The pastas when they arrived looked small, especially for their price tags. The tastes were good though, with the malfadini being both our favorite. I loved the texture of the noodles, as well as the pesto. The peppers were a great addition as well. The seafood was the best component of the black shells dish. Worth a visit if you're in the area.

It was juicy just not as tender as we thought. It was tough and super hard to pull apart and some parts were un appetizingly chewy. Def not good eats. I feel like it wasn't cooked as long as it should have been. Maybe a few more hours for porky.  The rapini it came with was smoky and good but messy since it was hard to cut.

I ordered off the Restaurant Week menu while my boyfriend ordered off the regular menu. We ordered the ricotta and honey dip and Italian butter bean dip. The ricotta has a sweet and spiciness that complements its creaminess very well. I was quite surprised by the bean dip at first as the oil has a very strong citrus flavor, but, again, it worked. My boyfriend ordered the goat fazzoletti and I got the hanger steak. Boyfriend's dish was quite tasty. My steak was slightly warmer than room temperature. It had already been cut, so it seemed it was rested and then left out. On top of the temperature, it's tough and closer to medium-well than to the medium I specified. I take a small bite out of the second piece just in case the butt-end was the only problem piece (I got 5 or 6 pieces of bite-sized steak, so really it ALL should have been cooked properly). Nope, still barely warm.We get the attention of the waitress and I tell her the steak is lukewarm at best. She looks at me and says, ""Do you want me to have them reheat the steak for you?"" If she offered to have a new one made, I didn't hear it and she certainly didn't offer to rush it. When I hesitated and said something about the meat becoming overcooked, she mumbles about talking to the chef. Less than 5 minutes later, my original steak has been burnt and sloppily replated and sent back to me. I see that they took the time to burn the half bite of steak to almost well-done and plate it too. We call our waitress over again. I apologize before telling her what happened. She looks at me and says, ""Okay, so what do you want? Do you want another steak?"" No apology, no hint of her previous friendliness. I hesitate as I really don't want another terrible steak. She sees this and, instead of offering me another look at the menu, rolls her eyes as she says, ""Okay so do you want the malfadini?"" I look confused, so she rolls her eyes and repeats herself. Seeing the confusion still on my face, she snaps, ""The pasta on the RW menu"". She's speaking to me aggressively and I just want her away from me, so I agree. Right after this point, I realize I've lost my appetite. My boyfriend has finished, and I want to leave. I asked for a manager because I want to tell someone to charge us for the apps and boyfriend's entree so we could go. The manager asks what happened, and I tell him more about the steak than the waitress. I think he thought I was about to cry because of the food as I don't recall really mentioning how awful the waitress was and how I felt bullied into getting a pasta dish. He insisted that I get another steak. When I told him I really lost my appetite, he insisted that we get it to-go. I appreciated how hard he was trying to make it right, so I accepted. As I'm speaking to him, the waitress comes out with the pasta dish and speaks in an alarmingly sweet voice to me. The manager looked surprised, which is why I'm assuming I didn't clearly explain everything. The dish itself was not good. The pasta was overcooked and was salty and acidic. I took two bites and left the rest. She takes the pasta away and comes back shortly to ask what I want for dessert. I tell her I don't want any dessert. When she comes out with the check, I realize she had the gall to charge us for my unfinished meal. We ask for the manager again and he graciously offers to take care of it. I think there must have been a lack of communication between the waitress and the manager as she sidles over again and asks if she can take the incorrect check. My boyfriend tells her we're waiting for the manager. She then proceeds to wordlessly take our placemats out from under our arms. Seemed like a passive aggressive way to tell us to leave as I saw bussers clearing EMPTY tables. The manager personally brings us our check and we are finally able to leave. I didn't get the manager's name, but he's the Caucasian man with curly light brown/blond hair and blue eyes. He really tried his best to make things right, and I feel bad that I wasn't able to explain things clearly. I hope he knows that I didn't want or eat that pasta dish. I was not trying to get free food. I literally told him to just charge me for the dip so I could leave. Honestly, I normally wouldn't get so emotional, but I had a terrible week (lost a source of income, father had a medical emergency, etc.) and this was supposed to be my special pick-me-up date with my boyfriend. Regardless of my week, the service should have been better. The manager gets 4.5/5 stars as he didn't seem to communicate with the waitress about the bill and I never got an apology from her. I have a really bad taste in my mouth, and it wasn't from the food. The rating might seem harsh, but I have never been so upset at a restaurant before.",1.0 star rating,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,0,-0.20000000298,27.7000007629,"waitress,boyfriend,ricotta,platinum blonde mohawk,management3,waitress,boyfriend,problem piece,waitress,steak,reservations,glasses,dish,manager,menu,menu,dip,butter bean dip,bean dip,hanger steak,waitress,nightMy,African American,oil,ricotta,creaminess,eyes,honey,spiciness,citrus flavor,goat fazzoletti,Boyfriend,appetite,bite,manager,steak,Restaurant Week,steak,steak,Italian,bite,manager,manager,steak,waitress,attention,piece,steak,steak,steak,steak,waitress,manager,room temperature,medium,temperature,waitress,steak,manager,pasta,boyfriend,top,waitress,case,taste,pieces,menu,menu,pasta dish,pasta dish,manager,food,manager,food,something,apology,one,meat,chef,friendliness,hint,malfadini,look,face,confusion,point,apps,pasta dish,entree,voice,name,eyes,someone,placemats,things,things,service,check,arms,way,bussers,tables,hair,best,dip,food,RW,restaurant,pasta,manager,dish,father,rating,source,income,emergency,bill,stars,mouth,bites,check,pasta,Caucasian,apology,check,care,dessert,dessert,rest,everything,meal,gall,communication,lack","1,1,7,7,7,1,1,4,1,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,7,1,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,4,5,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.103343270719,0.0688676461577,0.0559452213347,0.0502365119755,0.0346878431737,0.0324829369783,0.0324829369783,0.0288076307625,0.0207343865186,0.0199638921767,0.0198366492987,0.0198366492987,0.0159252714366,0.0140632018447,0.0127657111734,0.0127657111734,0.0127003993839,0.0127003993839,0.0126185901463,0.0123939048499,0.012013158761,0.011760737747,0.011760737747,0.0111436806619,0.0107356989756,0.0100990533829,0.0100221615285,0.00939451903105,0.00936036370695,0.00933395698667,0.00931243598461,0.00903386995196,0.00843321532011,0.00816209148616,0.00783473346382,0.00778894778341,0.00702741649002,0.00636698165908,0.00635351985693,0.00556415272877,0.00555533031002,0.00541073922068,0.00519183045253,0.00499836076051,0.0046193911694,0.00454083504155,0.00443327985704,0.00427810801193,0.00427482137457,0.00426338613033,0.00425847293809,0.00421497318894,0.0041241706349,0.00404856307432,0.00403712689877,0.00403712689877,0.00388529803604,0.0038821529597,0.00357782561332,0.0035597817041,0.00353240570985,0.00353207415901,0.00353093747981,0.00352780870162,0.00335943535902,0.00327029894106,0.00318928412162,0.00318604893982,0.00308791990392,0.00308331171982,0.00302335247397,0.00290778116323,0.00280411029235,0.0027813911438,0.00271107722074,0.00269794231281,0.00249742437154,0.00237182201818,0.00237182201818,0.00236032996327,0.00236032996327,0.00235772691667,0.00235772691667,0.00235533481464,0.00235533481464,0.00235312222503,0.00235106423497,0.00229258532636,0.00215134420432,0.00214637536556,0.00205765361898,0.00200667162426,0.00190816028044,0.00186057679821,0.00182459747884,0.00182459747884,0.00174237065949,0.00172380392905,0.00159788574092,0.00159745919518,0.00159745919518,0.00159745919518,0.00159663218074,0.00153663137462,0.00149370671716,0.00149235338904,0.00139405403752,0.00138617004268,0.00123526819516,0.00122992903925,0.00120536331087,0.00117615633644,0.00116029661149,0.00110387208406,0.00110387208406,0.00110387208406,0.00110337196384,0.00110337196384,0.0011031285394,0.00105114781763,0.00102586077992,0.000971314439084,0.000944930361584,0.000930200680159,0.000881505082361,0.000816432060674,0.000802188646048,0.000801943417173,0.000777188921347,0.000702680030372,0.000701341545209,0.000701341545209,0.000700937176589,0.000564950401895"

You have to check this place out - worth the hike to Williamsburg.I had originally bookmarked this place for its uni pasta dish, which to my dismay, had been replaced on the menu with the black shells dish (still in search of a delicious uni pasta dish, if anyone has any recs!). My group of 8 was seated at a long group table. The atmosphere of this place can be described as trendy, intimate, and overall just very ""in"" and a cool place to be for dinner Friday night. The staff members were all very accommodating and hospitable - every single one them.We started with the garlic, honey, ricotta dip for the table. I honestly could've eaten the entire thing straight, with a spoon, alone. It was THAT delicious. Although it sounds like an odd mix of flavors, trust me, it is a crowd pleaser.

Our table was positioned in the front bar area and although that area was full of energy it was a bit too loud for the parentals! Instead the front of house were able to put in a table in the back dining room for just twenty more minutes. Perfect amount of time for us to get some great cocktails at the bar. Once our table was ready, the restaurant was able to transfer the tab to the table and a hostess moved our drinks over on a silver platter (literally). Both my girlfriend and I have some food allergies which can be challenging at Italian restaurants. Leuca was a complete exception, they did a phenomenal job accommodating to a cows milk and gluten allergy. Our server was very knowledgable of the entire menu and was able to make suggestions and modifications to meet our needs. We started out with the sheep's milk ricotta, hot honey and garlic. Amazing. We also had the artichokes leaving everyone wanting more. Others at the table also had the shaved fennel salad which was a crowd pleaser. The main attraction this time was the Lamb. It is a braised Lamb shoulder with a side of char grilled or roasted potatoes with pesto and also yogurt for those without a dairy allergy. It was enough to feed three comfortable and maybe able to stretch out to four people. It was one of the most delicious peices of lamb I have ever had. I cannot wait to return and discover more of the menu. This place will be around for quite some time if they continue with the attentive service and the quality of the food.

For starters this place was in the basement of a hotel in a cool area. As you come downstairs you are greeted in a very friendly manner and seated. We were here for lunch, definitely coming back for dinner. We started off with sheep milk ricotta with warm honey toasted garlic and fried basil. Very good dish to eat solo if you love cheese or just to spread on the fresh semolina bread they give you with the warm olive oil.

However, I have celiac disease and ended up quite sick after dinner here. I, as I usually do, explained to the waiter and the hostess that I couldn't eat gluten or dairy. No one ever asked about the severity of my aversions. They did recommend some good options and I chose to have the steak which had onions and other charred veggies on top. Unfortunately after eating a few bites I discovered that the steak had been sprinkled with breadcrumbs. The waiter did check with the chef after I asked about the steak, determined there was an error made in the kitchen and the manager both gave me a new steak and comped it. Like I said before, I do think for a normal diner, this place is great. I just felt there was a lack of concern and attention given to the fact that I am unable to eat gluten. The waiter didn't even apologize!

I've seen Williamsburg get built up around us over the past 8 years, and while some may say the William Vale is an eye sore, you definitely have to experience it before knocking it. While waiting for our friends to arrive, we had a delicious (yet very pricey) cocktail at the bar. However, our friendly bartender was not so accommodating to our friend who asked if they had any non-alchoholic cocktails. His response was simply ""No."" Not even an offer to make anything without booze. Annoying, but moving on. The service was pretty great in the beginning of the meal, seemed like we had about 6 different servers taking orders and bringing out food, but they were attentive - at first. The waiter who took our order explained that the chef designed the menu so everyone could share every dish. However, when our antipasti arrived, we noticed that the 6 of us could probably have a small bite of each dish (the salads were slightly larger, but 2 prawns for an entire table to share? Blasphemy.) We all ordered our own pasta dishes, thankfully, to which the waiter noted that they would all be coming out at different times. He was not wrong. The four people who ordered the uni spaghetti (which was quite bland, everyone requested salt and pepper to season it), received their pastas a good 10 minutes before my husband and I received ours. thankfully, my goat fazzoletti was delicious, albeit on the smaller side compared to the spaghetti. the service tapered off towards the end of the meal. small things you would expect from a nicer restaurant they did not do, ie. folding a guest's napkin when they leave it on their chair when going to the restroom, bringing bread to enjoy the dip we ordered (how can you serve a dip without something to dip it in?), they finally brought it about 10 mins after we asked for it, by that time the dip was gone. i think the food was all-around delicious, but they should definitely not be selling their dishes as meant to be shared, especially for a table of 6, unless they want to increase their portions just a bit. also, the service can be improved upon. i know they just opened, so we are hopeful that they might work out the kinks in the coming months. however, we're not sure we'll be running back after dishing out almost $150 per couple for a slightly better than mediocre experience.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,11.1000003815,"restaurant,architecture,design,arrival,some,eye,bartender,friends,people,friend,waiter,William Vale,Williamsburg,waiter,response,everyone,cocktail,cocktails,service,dish,napkin,bar,servers,offer,booze,dish,orders,pasta dishes,order,service,anything,meal,everyone,table,times,goat fazzoletti,pastas,uni spaghetti,spaghetti,beginning,menu,chef,antipasti,bite,prawns,Blasphemy,food,food,dishes,husband,pepper,season,side,dip,table,something,service,salt,bit,portions,kinks,experience,salads,dip,restaurant,restroom,dip,meal,end,things,chair,guest,bread","2,7,7,4,1,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,1,6","0.0786257088184,0.0627501234412,0.0627501234412,0.0627501234412,0.053004719317,0.0371572561562,0.0345003902912,0.0340787693858,0.0304833874106,0.0263191610575,0.0262864157557,0.0217756498605,0.0203243847936,0.018059020862,0.0135411443189,0.0131214810535,0.013045382686,0.012997969985,0.012292034924,0.011816335842,0.0114176031202,0.0114156417549,0.0113648893312,0.0113158989698,0.0113158989698,0.0102663375437,0.0102587575093,0.0102426614612,0.00961493980139,0.00933961197734,0.00878392998129,0.00870135985315,0.00868838746101,0.00867679901421,0.00865678209811,0.00825356226414,0.0081096040085,0.0079067023471,0.00789979379624,0.00761350337416,0.00760215008631,0.00760215008631,0.00759200844914,0.00759200844914,0.00759200844914,0.00758284609765,0.0074741570279,0.00702732941136,0.00696363579482,0.00691806059331,0.00691806059331,0.00691806059331,0.00691201491281,0.00647446047515,0.00588486716151,0.00576068647206,0.00481862807646,0.00426312489435,0.00356472958811,0.00356472958811,0.00356020848267,0.00355810904875,0.00328860571608,0.00298774242401,0.00284202233888,0.00283996295184,0.00280417385511,0.00258680805564,0.0022630635649,0.00226132408716,0.00225968542509,0.00225968542509,0.00194064434618"

In my opinion, this place is highly overrated. Started off with the sheep's milk ricotta which was delicious and then the experience went downhill from there. We then had the fritto misto which is a mix of various seafood. The dish was unbearably over salted and would highly recommend you skip it if you do choose to come here. We also had the fire-roasted cabbage. It was meh at best. The classic pizza was flavorless. The hanger steak WAS TERRIBLE. The steak was impossible to chew -- was pretty much what I imagine chewing a tire to be like. One of the members in our party had malfadini pasta. It was also flavorless.For dessert, we had the pistachio cake which was nothing special and the bomboloni di Leuca. The bomboloni was probably the only thing that stood out in the restaurant.The waiters were mediocre and you kept having to repeat yourself.

I kind of like it when a server asks: ""Is this your first time here? Do you care to hear more about the menu?""The tuna crudo was excellent, as several reviewers here already agreed. The lamb sausage,was also very well prepared, as were the black shells with calamari. The food came pretty fast, the plates were fairly small, and that left me feeling like something was not right about the experience. Maybe it was just too little food for that $29 price point, so my suggestion is, if you go here with a decent appetite, just order from the regular menu. The pizza looked good but not huge, and may make a good little appetizer. The panini plates needed a little more going on, like maybe some green salad or a few olives. I had a similar feeling about lunch at ""Little Park"", Andrew C's other restaurant in downtown Manhattan.  The chocolate budino was excellent and was the citrus panna cotta, although this last dessert felt oddly out of place on a cold, snowy day in January.  The service was efficient, but the decor felt pretty bland, too monochromatic for such a large space that begged for more color and texture, leaving one feeling that this was a restaurantsomewhere in Orlando and not in Williamsburg.  Bright flower arrangements, modern table linens and some edgy art work could liven this space up considerably.The enormous, white glass hotel lobby walls were an imposing and somewhat anemic backdrop to this space and seemed to be fighting with it. The ultra modern, minimalistarchitecture of the building related not in the least to the beige and brown, very conservativerestaurant upholstery and light wood country dining tables. More needs to happen with the interior design here to get it out of the 90's.",4.0 star rating,"Hoboken, NJ",3,1,0.300000011921,8.80000019073,"$29,restaurant,menu,glass,shandy cocktail,side,price,red wine,semolina,decor,Sardinian,Little Park,servers,server,suggestions,lunch,ricotta dip,olive oil,part,suggestion,more,food,menu,menu,food,tuna crudo,lamb sausage,something,space,appetite,panini plates,lunch,reviewers,calamari,experience,order,price point,restaurantsomewhere,pizza,salad,olives,feeling,space,space,appetizer,flower arrangements,texture,backdrop,hotel lobby walls,art work,table linens,More,Andrew C,Manhattan,wood country dining tables,plates,least,building,minimalistarchitecture,beige,upholstery,interior design,service,shells,Williamsburg,Orlando,chocolate budino,citrus panna cotta,place,dessert,color","7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,4,1,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7","0.160252094269,0.0858266577125,0.0798635780811,0.0414076149464,0.0364579930902,0.036141782999,0.0347298197448,0.0304162837565,0.0303063411266,0.0222514756024,0.0180575475097,0.0159095544368,0.0145417694002,0.0145082958043,0.0142722949386,0.0132296746597,0.0116110108793,0.0116110108793,0.01157828141,0.0108478041366,0.0105284135789,0.00981646031141,0.00978310313076,0.00973903946579,0.0094381198287,0.00929756183177,0.00928186066449,0.0092680323869,0.00895847380161,0.0088592749089,0.00808921921998,0.00808102451265,0.0077873901464,0.00777423335239,0.00776264676824,0.00775229698047,0.00775229698047,0.00759854726493,0.00736049702391,0.00707828020677,0.00707828020677,0.00707110809162,0.00662157544866,0.00662157544866,0.00628605205566,0.00568616343662,0.0052742138505,0.00526990229264,0.00526990229264,0.00526990229264,0.00526990229264,0.00492795370519,0.00418741349131,0.00418741349131,0.00416752230376,0.00384454079904,0.00364621961489,0.00364621961489,0.00364621961489,0.00364621961489,0.00364621961489,0.0036435786169,0.0034724001307,0.00336862937547,0.00312271225266,0.00312271225266,0.00276552210562,0.00246725790203,0.00231567770243,0.00231567770243,0.00231365254149"
Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,34757,"For someone who frequents Williamsburg and the William Vale hotel frequently, I was extremely disappointed with our last visit to the restaurant. A group of us stopped in for brunch this past Sunday without a reservation and were seated immediately. After our initial order was taken and brought our shortly after, our waitress went on break without notice. For about 30 minutes we were left unattended until I got the attention of another waitress. Before I move on I'd like to add that the food was OK at best (3 stars). For being known as an Italian restaurant even the pizza was sub-par. Back to the service, after getting the attention of the new waitress and notifying her that the previous server had not been to our table since taking our order the new waitress then left us unattended to return only with our bill (we had planned in ordering more drinks and coffee). I proceeded to walk up to the bar myself to order drinks for the table. In comparison to Westlight, which is located on the top floor of this same hotel Lueca is certainly lacking. I've been to this restaurant several other times, more so because of the ambiance and atmosphere of the hotel but do not believe any of us will be back to Lueca anytime soon.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,61,"KenScale: 8.0/10It's no secret that I am in love with most of chef Andrew Carmellini's restaurants in the city, starting with the rustic Italian paradise Locanda Verde. I've always been enamored with how chef Carmellini's kitchen always seems to achieve brilliance with effortlessness and simplicity of ingredients and technique. When his NoHo Hospitality team decided to venture outside Manhattan to open a new project inside the shiny William Vale hotel in Williamsburg, though, I wondered whether he was stretching a little bit too thin. I haven't been to the William Vale hotel up to the point I had visited Leuca, but from the looks of it, it seemed totally out of place in the Williamsburg neighborhood with its giant, intimidating building and glitzy decors, although it seemed like a great place to go to the rooftop in the summer, in direct competition to the Wythe Hotel that was ruling the Brooklyn rooftop scene until then. Hotel restaurants are always a tricky proposition. Locanda Verde was such a great exception because even though it is attached to the Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa, it really functioned like a standalone dining space with its distinct vibe. On the other hand, would Leuca be buried under the lights from the brand-new William Vale and at the same lose its identity (and, even worse, quality of food)? My recent visit with my girlfriend showed enough from the restaurant that I think Leuca is not just a cheesy hotel restaurant, or (thankfully) a copycat of Locanda Verde.The menu at Leuca focuses on southern Italian cuisine. Locanda Verde has been famous for its sheep's milk ricotta cheese, and the one in Leuca was equally delicious, this time accompanied by hot honey and garlic that gave a pleasantly spicy kick that my girlfriend just couldn't stop raving about. We also enjoyed fire-roasted cabbage with Caesar flavors, which tasted a bit too salty at first but over time grew on us as we learned that the salty sensation really came from anchovy and nothing else. We also ordered a pizza pie and a pasta dish. The OG pizza with pepperoni, nduja and Fresno chili was serviceable, but it would've been even better if seasoning were slightly toned down. On the other hand, the big surprise for us was the black shells pasta accompanied by ruby shrimp and local calamari that displayed really nice balance of flavor and texture. It's not often that you don't get bored with a pasta dish from start to finish, but we savored every single scoop. For dessert, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered Sicilian pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, which was so delightfully (but not overwhelmingly sweet) that, even though we were quite full by the time this dish came out, we finished it within a minute. Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult, and the restaurant space is quite large, so you may get lucky and have an opportunity to dine at Leuca without a reservation. There is full bar with extensive Italian wine selections with emphasis on southern Italy and Sicily. The dining space feels more modern and geometrical than Locanda Verde but overall it still worked as a trendy space where you can take your date or have a casual dinner with friends.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,189174,"Service here is impeccable, food is meh. Came here last night for Valentine's Day. Before making the reservation I inquired if it would be possible for us to go upstairs to the rooftop bar Westlight and the woman said yeah sure. Big reason why we chose this place, because we figured we would have a drink upstairs and check out the view after. Did not think nor were we told that a reservation was needed for one drink. Appetizers were a blob of ricotta with honey and some seaweed flakes on top. Just okay, like how much ricotta can you have? Then came a shaved fennel salad with Parmesan and green apple- not a huge fan of raw shaved fennel which overpowered the dish and the citrusy vinaigrette didn't really bring the dish together like I would have liked. Then there was a tuna sashimi appetizer which I have had at countless restaurants before, it tasted the same as everywhere else I've had it. Out of the first course this was the best dish. For the second course, there were scallops which were cooked very well but they were on a bed of grains which were swimming in this citrus dressing which overpowered the dish. With that came the sweet potato gnocchi which was deelish!!... not enough of it though in my opinion. We slopped that up but we were still hungry by the time the entrees came. For the entree course, there was a half lobster which was the star of the show! The lobster was cooked to perfection and I loved how the clarified butter was right in the shell so no dipping necessary and it was super juicy. The steak on the other hand left a lot to be desired. They didn't ask how we would like it cooked, It came out medium rare which I would not have preferred and it was a bit chewy. It came next to a red pepper and walnut type spread which I have had at Mediterranean places before. They didn't add much to it. After dinner I still felt hungry and we did not leave anything on the plate except for the some shaved fennel and some ricotta. Dessert was coffee ice cream with some toppings, it was good, not great. When we were done with our pricey meal -- spent $300 including tip with only 2 drinks -- I asked the hostess again if we could check out Westlight and she directed us to the hotel lobby. When we got there, we were rudely rejected by the bouncer who asked If we had reservations, when I said no he started shaking his head right away, did not care that we are just coming from Leuca and they told us it would be no problem. Refused to even consider accommodating us even if when I asked if we could literally go up there for 5 minutes just to look at the view, he said the manager said absolutely no one up there without a reservation. The lack of coordination between the restaurant and sister bar upstairs was disappointing and the bouncers pretentious attitude about the whole thing left us feeling like we did not want to return to either place.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,13.8000001907,"tuna sashimi appetizer,food,Service,lobster,reservation,place,drink,rooftop bar,fennel salad,view,woman,reason,bouncer,sweet potato gnocchi,citrus dressing,grains,Valentine's Day,type spread,Westlight,reservation,dish,scallops,hostess,drink,ricotta,ricotta,fennel,dish,top,blob,honey,seaweed flakes,Parmesan,apple,fan,vinaigrette,coffee ice cream,entrees,course,course,entree course,butter,restaurants,star,same,everywhere,bed,opinion,show,perfection,steak,reservations,shell,hand,red pepper,walnut,problem,lot,Appetizers,hotel lobby,head,reservation,anything,place,bouncers,lack,view,restaurant,sister bar,thing,attitude,coordination,manager,Leuca,places,ricotta,fennel,drinks,much,plate,dinner,toppings,meal,Mediterranean,tip","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,1,7,2,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,6,4,7,7,2,7","0.131810203195,0.0586308464408,0.0586308464408,0.0573508813977,0.039574034512,0.02848299779,0.02848299779,0.0260113552213,0.0235960464925,0.0228423289955,0.0227690357715,0.022686438635,0.0204939469695,0.0194222386926,0.014721176587,0.014721176587,0.0135672045872,0.0133804120123,0.012515370734,0.0116934133694,0.0116240410134,0.0110637806356,0.0109007284045,0.010865252465,0.0108401980251,0.0108190597966,0.0108007825911,0.00998544599861,0.0086280265823,0.0086280265823,0.0086280265823,0.0086280265823,0.00859664101154,0.00859664101154,0.00859664101154,0.00859664101154,0.00739866448566,0.00728959729895,0.00727264070883,0.00726386299357,0.00723537243903,0.00687025673687,0.00662382598966,0.00613471399993,0.00579541316256,0.00579541316256,0.00578069174662,0.0057684648782,0.00575801217929,0.00575330387801,0.00553438719362,0.00529279606417,0.00526482006535,0.00526077579707,0.00525336386636,0.00525336386636,0.00479307165369,0.00463442038745,0.00427234871313,0.00391517253593,0.00391306076199,0.00366257713176,0.00340939173475,0.00340111204423,0.00325429881923,0.00323200481944,0.00309488200583,0.00309334299527,0.00309334299527,0.0027062385343,0.0027062385343,0.0027062385343,0.0025091948919,0.0023162192665,0.00216305395588,0.00216030981392,0.00216030981392,0.00215781875886,0.00196599517949,0.00171885662712,0.00171885662712,0.00171784264967,0.00171687430702,0.00101854011882,0.00100773642771"

It's gorgeous and spacious, a bit of old school glamour with new-school Brooklyn quirk. The entire place just oozes good taste and luxury, and I would kill for a bottle of their room perfume.Go with a large group so you can 1) sit in a huge cushy leather sofa, and 2) order the crispy suckling pig to share. That pig must have been raised with a lot of TLC... not very ""porky"" or fatty at all, it had a really clean flavor, tender meat, and crazy crispy skin. We were picking the last bits of meat off the bones, just stopping short of manhandling the ribs and going at it with hands and teeth because the dining room is not that sort of place. I also loved the fire-roasted cabbage, a sort of cooked rendition of a caesar salad. It took cabbage to places I never thought it could go. The Cauliflower fritto were nice bites for sharing. Pizzas are of the super thin-crust, charred variety (a bit too much char for my taste) - the OG and 18th avenue pizzas were pretty good. I liked the pastas better, especially the malfadini which are ribbon-like noodles that have good chew and pick up the sauce nicely. The sauce of pesto and sweet and sour pepper is just different enough to be interesting but not weird. Although some believe that sea urchin is overdone, I love it and wished there was more in the spicy sea urchin spaghetti (it was still very good). For dessert, my favorite was the Budino. Afterwards, we went up to Westlight, the rooftop bar at the hotel, and I highly recommend you stop by to take in the stunning views.

Wish I could say this was a 10 across the board but the real issue with this place is their service and truly nothing else.  The decor, atmosphere, food...all really quite nice!  Some of the waitstaff though...could use help.  Especially for a place of this caliber and after having read other reviews on this, I know it wasn't just a fluke experience only we had. My husband and I were really pumped about finally eating here especially after having watched this building go up in the last couple years.  Here lies our issues:Like the previous reviewer, our dinner took 2.5 hours for TWO people!  This is only because of the lack of attention our waitress gave us. 1: When seated, it seemed like forever for anyone to come up and greet us to the point where a gentlemen whom, I'm assuming was the manager, actually walked over to us concerned that we hadn't been taken care of yet.  Now, we're not ones for making anyones job harder as we've been in the service industry ourselves but we had to let him know we've been there a while and were frankly starving at this point.  He politely took our appetizer order.  When our waitress finally came over she didn't even seem to be apologetic for the lack of attention and that we had already proceeded to order our appetizer with the manager.  She just seemed like ""okay great so you're taken care of"" and almost walked away before my husband had to stop her so we could finally order our main course.  Sheep's milk ricotta and hot honey spread was insanely amazing though when it did show up.2: Again, like the previous reviewer, had we known this was a ""come as it's ready"" place we probably would have ordered differently or at least requested they both come at the same time since we were not interested in each other dishes (I don't like spicy food).  But we had no idea and would have appreciated the heads up like most other restaurants would give.Overall, the experience with our waitress was what left us feeling disappointed about the whole experience and don't plan to be back for dinner unless it's just sitting at the bar for a quick app or something.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,7.0,"service,experience,waitress,review,board,milk ricotta,husband,reviewer,lack,place,Leuca,Kate S.,nothing,decor,gentlemen,point,reviews,fluke experience,waitstaff,place,food,issues,atmosphere,help,Some,caliber,anyone,care,job,dinner,manager,attention,point,appetizer,attention,appetizer order,people,ones,service industry,building,food,restaurants,experience,dishes,experience,dinner,heads,idea,bar,app,something,care,manager,course,Sheep,honey spread","7,7,1,5,3,7,1,5,7,7,3,1,7,7,1,7,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,1,7,7,4","0.132796674967,0.0779340714216,0.0754197388887,0.0654715821147,0.0587277337909,0.0572969540954,0.0485625639558,0.0373759269714,0.0311803389341,0.0291681401432,0.0289197806269,0.0289197806269,0.0232427790761,0.0231242422014,0.0178997293115,0.0171348396689,0.0160990189761,0.012661812827,0.0119195068255,0.011044818908,0.0101126097143,0.00939126778394,0.00884943362325,0.0088172648102,0.0088172648102,0.00879239290953,0.00788655504584,0.00784096028656,0.00758245540783,0.00757274124771,0.00717581715435,0.00674554053694,0.00615574186668,0.0061415405944,0.0061415405944,0.00595346558839,0.00591227551922,0.00588562013581,0.00588562013581,0.00508827948943,0.00469753425568,0.00454463157803,0.00447737472132,0.00400713365525,0.00374936312437,0.00316835730337,0.00299105513841,0.00277194962837,0.00277194962837,0.00277194962837,0.00277194962837,0.00234131980687,0.00201284792274,0.00175915635191,0.00175750372,0.00175750372"

We shared a couple antipasti and two of us had pasta dishes and two had fish. It was all excellent. In the eggplant antipasti and my squash pasta dish the flavors were complex and with surprises and highly attentive to texture. I'm texture crazy, must have plenty, so it was right up my alley. It's rich food. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. But do try a lot of things, I'd just suggest sharing and passing around tastes a lot if you're in a group. The space is beautiful, the service is professional, attentive, warm and friendly. I spied a gorgeous private dining room in the back with painted walls and ceilings, its own bar looking like it seats about 24? At a long table, with doors that close. It would be lovely for birthday parties, anniversary parties, small wedding receptions. They brought us ice cream with a candle as a surprise for our anniversary. Thank you to them for a wonderful evening. The only disappointment of the whole excursion, which is not Leuca's fault but I note it here if you plan to go, Westlight, the rooftop bar at the hotel has unhelpful, bit immature staff. I called in advance saying after dinner we'd like to go is there anything to know? Nope. Doesn't say we need a reservation. We go up and pass by reception, I say we just dined at Leuca, are coming in the bar, they just point to the door to the outdoor section and again they don't mention getting on a wait list for a table. They remind me of kids working the door at clubs back in college. Turns out once we see the view and come inside we were unable to be seated.

Leuca,5508,111 N 12th StThe William Vale Hotel,Brooklyn,11249.0,6025,"I really wanted to like my experience at Leuca, but the service/experience is leaving an unfortunate taste in my mouth. We went out for dinner, and had a number of issues with the way things went. Firstly, this dinner took 2.5 hours, mostly because of the slowness of the service. We were not really looking for a total evening affair and were exhausted by the end of it. Pet peeves:1. This is a 'come as it's ready' sort of share-plate place. Had I realized this before I may have declined, because it was 2 other couples, and we have widely different tastes and wanted very different food. So, unfortunately, this meant that at times, people had no food, some people had food, and it was constantly awkward. I really don't appreciate dining experiences like this, and while I get the concept, it really should be able to be delivered in either way. This was not ideal for our group.2. Attentiveness of the service was lack thereof. I felt like we were constantly looking for our server and trying to get help. This is frustrating for a place of this calibur and price, and it was definitely added annoyance that there seemed to be tons of staff milling around and not doing much. Couldn't they have checked on our table?  3. The food was great but not outstanding. I thought the tuna crudo was great, but everything else was fairly standard italian fare.4. The most unnerving part of this is at the end, we wanted to use cash and just put a nominal amount on our debit card, but the server did not do this correctly. It's now 5 days later and I still have a 400 dollar hold on my account (my DEBIT account mind you) and the charge that they eventually charged to my account. So I have 500+ dollars that this place has put on my card right now. This is absolutely unprofessional and ridiculous. No amends was made, no future discount for this, not even a complimentary beverage or dessert. Perhaps this is okay to people with loads of money in their checking account but this is still setting me back and really preventing me from thinking of going back here and from paying a bill I would like to pay.Overall, this place is pretty, is nice and big for Williamsburg, but until they iron out the kinks in their service, I'm not tempted to go back there. Disappointing as I had super high expectations, and was really looking forward to it. Oh, did I mention it was my birthday? Awful birthday experience. Thanks Leuca!

It was very good. The portion is large. We had a lot left over and there were 4 of us. They provide bread which goes well with the dip. We also ordered the bone marrow alla vaccinara. It was super tasty!! For my entree, I had the lobster in purgatorio and omg! The lobster was perfectly cooked and placed back in the shell! It was very tasty and had a kick to it, they add sliced hot peppers. Lastly, for dessert I had the bomboloni di leuca, those were so yummy!

They offered a la carte menu. Our server, Katana, was great. She was knowledgeable, friendly and so cute. It's shared plates so I got to try a lot.  Starters: ricotta with hot honey, 18th street pizza, bone marrow and smoked beets. These all may sound like simple dishes but the flavors are so elevated.  They smokiness of the beets really came through. I've never had anything like that, it was really delicious. If you've eaten at Locande Verde, you know the ricotta is amazing.  All the starters are nicely sized. Pastas: spicy sea urchin spaghetti and broccoli rabe malfadini. Meat dish: grilled lamb. Fish: local bass. Again, all the dishes were well generously portioned for sharing. The sea urchin spaghetti was the perfect balance of briney-ness and creaminess with a slight bite of spice.  The malfadini was so unique.  I do like this type of pasta and very few restaurants in NY offer it.  Broccoli rabe makes this dish slightly bitter in a good way. Very hearty for a vegetarian dish.  The bass was on a bed of beans was cooked perfectly, so delicate and flavorful.  We couldn't leave without having desserts after such a wonderful meal.  We got the pistachio cake with olive oil ice cream, budino, gelato (olive oil and espresso were yummy) and the cheesecake was absolutely devine.

It's very well decorated and the color palette is so aesthetically pleasing. Service was very fast and everyone was super friendly. They're still in the middle of their soft opening so the menu is smaller and hours are shorter. We ordered the 12 inch burrata prosciutto truffle pizza ($22)which was delicious. I find that higher end pizza usually skimp on putting more toppings on the pizza but Levante actually served good proportions of each one. Not too salty. They also provided a chili oil, regular olive oil(?) and red pepper flakes on the side. I'm normally not much of a pizza person but I really liked how light this one tasted.

With her recommendations and our tastes, we choose the rucola pizza pie and the fish of the day.For those in a hurry, it may take some time. Luckily the ambience was right and we enjoyed the setting. Music is loud! The bathrooms are new and clean. The bar looked very elegant at night, but we decided not to drink that day. However, their soft drinks selection was alright so we ordered San Pellegrinos. Our entrees were delicious and exactly what was expected... and better! Our waitress suggested some spicy oil for the pizza since we love spicy food. It hit the spot as it was light. Pizza can get oily, but it was fresh and I have no complaints! The ricotta fish dish was unexpected and was a hit. We downed it quicker than the pizza! We will definitely be coming back when the time calls. Pricey pizza but hits the spot.

The tuna was not very fresh at all, tasted fishy and we didn't finish it. The rice in the rice balls was kinda hard and they were bland. Again, pizza crust = amazing, rest of pizza = average.

Levante,5509,26-21 Jackson Ave,Long Island City,11101.0,197851,"My husband and I were super excited about the opening of Levante, especially because of the gluten free selections! We went there on a Tuesday night at 5:45. I asked for a gluten free pizza, and the waiter informed me that they ran out earlier in the day. Which was disappointing, but fine, because I figured I could order GF pasta. We waited 25-30 minutes for 2 pasta dishes. Not sure why it took so long because there was only two other people in the restaurant besides us. When it finally came out, my order was wrong. I ordered the pomodoro, and something else with chicken or fish had come out instead. I told the waiter, who reluctantly brought my food to the back, then he slowly came back out after a few minutes and said ""if you want us to remake it, itll be another 12 minutes"". So by that point I said no, thats fine leave it out.All the while, a manager sat right there, helped the waiter take my dish off the bill, and not once did she come over to apologize.For two diners coming there on a Tuesday night, you have to figure they're local and could potentially be regulars.

Levante,5509,26-21 Jackson Ave,Long Island City,11101.0,197810,"Coming in hot (Just like its pizza), I say this with the utmost confidence: I had the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life at Levante. Let me say that again, the best pizza I have ever had in my life was at Levante. I've had a long love affair with Kest'e - Levante was better. Roberta's was incredible, I thought it was amazing- Levante was better. When people visit me in the city, I tell them ""for a great time, and amazing pizza, go to Julianna's,"" - yet Levante was better. Levante now reigns supreme with the greatest pizzas across New York City, and I knew it from my first bite. Levante just opened in the Long Island City section of Queens back in September. Its owner, Michele Iuliano, also owns Luzzo BK and has several other restaurants across New York City. He is a son of Italy, and takes pride in the process of their pizza making, boasting that they let their pizza dough ferment for 72-96 hours. By allowing your dough to ferment for this long, the dough expands to its maximum size, which in turn makes the pizza lighter when fully cooked (The opposite process is not allowing full fermentation, so the dough becomes heavy and expands during digestion, making you feel bogged down). The wood fire oven was built in the US, and the company that built the oven did it to the exact specifics Iuliano requested. It was early Sunday evening when I walked into Levante, there was only one table occupied while the rest of the restaurant was empty. By the time our check came, every table was occupied and seating was beginning to fill up at the bar. Word to the wise, get there now while you can still grab a seat because in no time this place will be jamming. When it came to pizza, I ordered The Levante (mozzarella, oven-roasted wild mushrooms, truffle pate', prosciutto, burrata). As soon as the pizza comes to your table, you're hit with the earthy musk aroma of the truffle. It added a hint of garlic flavoring to the pie. The mix of burrata and mozzarella cheese was rich and creamy, which was A sweet flavor that is still making my mouth water while remembering this [past Sunday night. The prosciutto added a savory kick to the pizza. It was really an explosion of flavor all around. Their crust... soft and chewy with dark crunchy brown spots throughout the pie. The worst part of this meal was when I finished. JZ even ate her crust, and she never eats all the crust. Once again, I say this with passion and sincerity, go to Levante. It was without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had.

Levante,5509,26-21 Jackson Ave,Long Island City,11101.0,26746,"After reading the reviews and seeing the photos I thought I would check this spot out. Upon arrival we were informed that there would be a 30 min wait for a table or we could eat at the bar.  So we ordered a margarita pizza and sat at the bar.  We got a bottle of what appeared to be homemade seltzer with decent fizz and it was only like $4 so cool.  We were given some pizza dough sticks and olive oil while we waited. They weren't great but it was a nice gesture.  About 30 minutes later we were informed that there was a mistake and our order would be out soon.  Ok cool.  They were nice and honest about the mistake. I can respect that.  Finally the pizza arrives and well?  The crust/dough was too chewy and a little under done. The cheese was not fully melted and were basically flavorless chewy marbles of cheese. The sauce lacked texture as there were no chunks of plum tomato or anything else. I found that the sauce not only lacked texture but, had no depth of flavor or brightness or sweetness or really much of any flavor at all quite frankly.  I see others writing fantastic reviews for this place and I just don't get it.  5 stars is reserved for places like Di'Fara's or Posto or maybe Patsy's. I am very sorry but this is just not even in the same league.  The space is really nicely done and the people were super nice but I came for 4 or 5 star pizza and honestly didn't even get close.",1.0 star rating,"Long Island City, NY",2,0,-0.10000000149,10.0,"reviews,photos,spot,gesture,arrival,table,margarita pizza,seltzer,bar,bar,fizz,dough,pizza,order,mistake,reviews,mistake,bottle,cheese,cheese,texture,sauce,olive oil,crust,little,marbles,plum tomato,place,places,stars,space,pizza dough sticks,star pizza,league,Di'Fara's,Posto,Patsy,chunks,flavor,flavor,texture,sauce,anything,brightness,sweetness,much,depth,people,others","5,5,7,7,4,7,6,1,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,5,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,6,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1","0.165263235569,0.107884019613,0.0952729955316,0.0536228120327,0.0518169775605,0.0518169775605,0.0267243422568,0.0241232290864,0.0227143969387,0.0225983597338,0.0197083037347,0.0179128199816,0.0177703611553,0.016188679263,0.0160951912403,0.015141912736,0.0150607898831,0.0145492842421,0.0137202814221,0.0137202814221,0.0137074207887,0.0137074207887,0.0132784554735,0.0131321493536,0.0120187047869,0.0120065333322,0.0119952755049,0.0102276550606,0.0102198058739,0.0102198058739,0.0101356059313,0.00943392608315,0.00836316309869,0.00618831301108,0.00529546895996,0.00529546895996,0.00529546895996,0.00519867707044,0.0044919247739,0.0044919247739,0.0044919247739,0.0044919247739,0.00393338454887,0.0039299451746,0.0039299451746,0.0039299451746,0.0039299451746,0.00267836730927,0.00227621011436"

The agnolotti with truffle buttata were divine! The tuna entree also great an beautifully presented! The lava cake was good but the great surprise came with the ricotta cake, simply outstanding; it reminded us of Italy. The restaurant it's not cheap but I would not define it as expensive, and the quality of their product is way above all the other restaurant in the neighborhood that I've tried so far!

Being that it was the closest option and the pics looked great I went for it. So glad I accidentally found this place !! I love the exposed brick, wooden beams, and lights. It has a rustic industrial feel which gives it a nice coziness. They also have backyard seating as well. My waitress was very sweet and gave me the run down of their specials. I told her I was only having pizza but the options sounded great. My pie came out quickly. It was a delicious authentic thin crust brick oven personal pie with roasted garlic and spicy salami... I liked that my Arnold Palmer came in a wine glass, that was a nice touch. Finally the post meal cappuccino came with two tiny almond cookies. Super cute !! The music was very chill which goes well with the atmosphere. I'm definitely looking forward to returning to have some of their pasta dishes which look and sound amazing.

Levante is by no means a well oiled machine. They're not really sure what they wanna be yet, some of the menu items can be way to expensive, the staff can be uncoordinated, but forget about all of that. There's good pizza in Court Square now. This place is instantly the king of the neighborhood. Of the 5 or so pizza's I've tried at Levante, I found all under-seasoned, but that's an easy DIY fix. For the people who find the pizza burned, you'll just have to come around to Naples style of pizza craft. Court Square has probably been the worst pizza neighborhood in NYC for decades, so it'll take time to educate the locals. Levante makes artisan pizza in a super hot wood oven, so the product doesn't compare the ubiquitous, double-cooked, 500 degree slice counters. That's a good thing. Learn to appreciate the flavors and textures of a high heat cook. Forget the menu and the quirky, secondary aspirations of the restaurant, and just order some pizzas.
