They weren't that great but the pork tasted the same.Also had the pork bun... it was meh. Pork was good, outside was basic.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,99,"While waiting for my To Go order to be prepared, I marvel at the bustling activity all along the Elmhurst section of Broadway. The food scene is quite active as restaurants are all full during my early evening midweek food sourcing excursion.Sixteen dumplings, eight boiled and eight fried took a good fifteen minutes to be prepared, but the prep time mattered not once I sunk my teeth into the bundles of deliciousness. The leeks work so well with the ground pork, a delicious combination with a dab of soy sauce which luckily I had in my pantry as none were included. At $2.75 each serving of eight pieces, I'm not about to split hairs, I just hope its not a  reoccurring theme which would be detrimental to my meal if I forget to ask on future dumpling To Go orders.The aroma drawn off the Tendo Beef & Hand drawn Noodle Soup coming from the patrons at the tables totally seduced ny nostrils and I slapped another $5.50 upon the checkout counter and ordered myself up one. As the night's are rapidly getting cooler, the meal provided a unusually enjoyable warm spot in my backpack, as I wove through traffic to get my dinner home while warm. Once at my dinner table and began the unwrapping and consumption process, I was not overly enthusiastic on the soup as the beef was a bit tough and the soup a touch salty.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,42832,"I really like this place for the chewy, al-dente noodles. It is delicious and super cheap for fulfilling meal. I crave their sesame sauce noodle on a hot day when I just want a simple and satisfying meal.  It usually comes with a few green leafy veggies and the sauce is so addicting. I especially love to add a few drops of the chili oil that are dispersed on different tables in this no-frills, no ambiance restaurant. Turn over rate is pretty fast as most people just get in, eat, and get out. There are lots of other restaurants in the area and bubble tea place across the street. Parking can be a bit problematic but usually I can find something. Other dishes I have tried before are the beef noodle soup noodle. They separate the noodle and the soup for you in different containers so the noodle doesn't get soggy. So thoughtful!!! Lots of meat too! Also tried the dan dan noodle - not as good as the zha jiang noodle. Noodles are between $4.50-$6. The cold dishes are awesome. The meat and vegetable cold appetizers are different pricing.

The place has zero decor, English is limited but enough to get by, and the place seems kinda dingy/seedy, kinda has a Chinatown basement kinda feel. This place is super Chinese for better or worst, it's cafeteria style, you pay at the register and you wait for them to call your number. You even have to dump the food out yourself.The food:Dumplings- I am not sure if they offer different varieties but I always just ask for steamed or fried. The steamed is always really good, the filling to dough ratio is great and the chili oil or chili sauce table side are nice additions. The fried I think it's hit or miss. Either it's perfect or the outside edges are chewy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Noodles- The noodles here are very good, the noodles are actually made in house. If you look in the back, you could usually see someone pulling noodles, it's pretty cool. I have had the beef noodle soup and the beef stew noodle soup and I really like both. I usually ask for thick noodles, I like that a little better than the reg noodles that they give.Cold Items- Last time I got beef tendon in chilli oil and it was really good.

The skin is perfectly browned and crispy yet chewy and thick (unlike most japanese gyoza). My boyfriend and I also got two bowls of noodles. Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup:Beef isn't that great-- it's not fall-apart but it's sliced thin and pulls apart quite easily, though I'm more accustomed to something more juicy. The broth is well-seasoned and very authentic though both broths are very light compared to the usual. Noodles are fresh, thick, and perfectly cooked. It's a huge serving for the price you pay. Wonton-Fishball Noodle Soup:The broth is light but well-seasoned. The wontons are hand-wrapped and the filling was wonderful. Fishballs were typical but not worth it. Next time I'll probably stick with just wontons. Heavy noodles and wontons are cut with bitter greens.

Ummmmmm you must be drunk! Yes they are in the same category. Serving cheap Chinese dumplings. But no. It is not better that those two.We got: 1. an order of pan fried pork and Chive dumplings that came with 8 pieces ($2.75). Skin was too thick. Filling was alright and in no way better than the others.2. Beef scallion pancakes ($3). This was served last. Cold, soggy and oily. I took one bite and wanted to throw it up.3. Beef stew noodle soup ($5 something). Hand pulled noodles were firm. I'm no noodle expert so I really can't tell the difference between hand pulled and machine made. I didn't get to appreciate it that much. The broth. A bit salty. 4. Beef tripe (&5 something). I didn't taste this. It wasn't appetizing. But fromThe looks of it, I saw more meat than tripe in there. Cheap eats. Yes. We spent about $15 on all that. Bf and I shared everything and I'm glad we did. There's no way I would have finished anything. Would I come back again?

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,195329,"When The New York Times ran a story on Hung Ry recently, I immediately thought of Lao Bei Fang in Elmhurst, NY. They are sort of Country Mouse and City Mouse; Hung Ry in Noho, the other in Queens (right next to loud railroad). Hung Ry has a fancy Western broth maker or chef (Michael Hodgkins), Lao Bei Fang has worn huge pots. One brags about ""finest organic"" stuff, but the other one do not use that word at all. You can connect to Hung Ry via website or Facebook, Lao Bei Fang doesn't have any of those except Chinese character dominated brochure, which you can only get when you're there. No virtual world stuff. (Of course, Yelp talked about Lao Bei Fang)But you know what? Both of them are mouse! The two are sharing the core value; hand pulled or drawn noodle. Also, two Chinese noodle masters do not speak English, either. They communicate through whipping noodle. Lao Bei Fang is a small noodle & dumpling joint with about 15 seats. Noodle is the thing you have to order there. The noodle master will start to show off his magic trick right after you place an order. Quick hand tricks give a birth to this beautiful chewy noodle. Noodle could be thick or thin depending on noodle master's mood, but it's always chewy and springy. Hand pulled noodle tends to be thicker than factory produced ones; the beauty of irregularity of handmade. Above is vegetable noodle ($4). Clear broth with all kinds of veggie (including not-so-very-nutritious iceberg) would sooth you. Overall, it's pretty plain; no overuse of salt which highlights homemade noodle. If it's too bland to your taste, you can splash with hot pepper oil. It's not fiery hot, either.On a recent visit, I ordered Fresh Pork Bone soup ($4.25). This is what I got. Three huge pork bones on the top of freshly made noodle with a few bokchoy and cilantro, scallion. Its gigantic, barbarian looking surprised me, them calmed me down with clean, sophisticated broth. Pork bones didn't have much meat on it, but what a presentation!    This is regular Beef noodle ($4.25) that you can find anywhere else. This version is not too Chinese; so if you are not a huge fan of distinctive Chinese spice, this is the way to go. It has generous portion of beef as well. Lao Bei Fang's noodle is cooked al dente at first, but it continues to cook inside of the soup. So if you prefer firm noodle texture, you better hurry up and finish. Dumplings are not to be missed. This steamed veggie one was $3.25 for 8 pieces. What a bargain. Like noodle, dumplings are freshly made too. It's little doughy for me, but it's not so much comparing to regular Chinese dumpling's standard. Fried dumplings seems ""a must"" for every diner at Lao Bei Fang. For $1.25, you can add one to your noodle dish. Sort of side dish, it is. This one was pork and chive, which was juicy and warm.They sell frozen dumplings, too. For 50 pieces, it's only $11~13 depending on what kinds. So, why not make yourself travel to Elmhurst this weekends for comforting hand drawn noodle soup and dumplings? Then reward yourself coming home with frozen dumplings for next week?

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,195380,"My wife and I use to live right around the corner from this place, and we were frequent visitors!! If you ever want to try fresh hand-drawn noodles, this is the place to go. The decor of the restaurant is a little run down...only a few tables and bar seats. As for the cleanliness, its so-so. The tables and seats are a bit sticky and I have seen an occasional bug, but we always take the food to go. As for the food, the noodles are delicious. Once you place the order, the chef will then began to make your order. You get to watch him pull your noodles from a ball of dough. They do have a selection of noodles on their menu, but we tend to stick to our favorites: black bean sauce noodle, beef noodle soup, and Chinese preserved veggies noodle soup. Besides their noodles, the dumplings (steamed or fried) are excellent. The dough is nice and thick, which is an indication that they hand-make the dumplings themselves.

Regardless of whether I order the beef, tripe, fish balls, or whatever, there's always a good amount of meat to satisfy my belly. The bowl is so huge and filling that I'm always stuffed afterwards even if I don't finish.The pork and chive dumplings are pricier than places in Chinatown (4 for $1.25), but they have the best flavor. The bottoms are fried to a nice crisp to accompany the softness of the steamed dough, and the pork is always juicy.Only downsides: No real A/C or heating, so the temperature outside is only slightly worse than the temperature inside.

Still very flavorful and great choices of side dishes. I am 50/50 about their Lamb-flavored hand pulled noodles. Lamb broth is very rich with that lamb meat taste & aroma. Quality of their hand pulled noodles varies - sometimes good and sometimes not that fresh.No waiter service and there is no tips required.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,361,Hot pot buffet for 21.99 a person. You can opt for individual soup bowls or a larger shared soup bowl. I like that there's a side cart if you're sitting in a small table so you can put extra plates of food on. The service here is very good. The waiters are very attentive and occasionally comes around to remove the fatty top layer of the soup for you. (Note: I did come here twice during off peak hours so I'm not sure how it is during peak hours.) They also give you large plastic bags to put your jacket and bag in so they don't smell afterwards.The meat is very thinly sliced which is a plus. I also like that they have fish paste. Most of the other all you can eat hot pot places don't serve fish paste. The fried tofu skin is also a plus! Get the pork bone cylinder soup! The presentation of the food is nice too. Veggies are serve in a mini wooden barrel and the fried tofu skin is served on a bowl that looks like a chicken. The place is decorated with a lot of old cassette tapes on the back of the right side of the wall. The front also has an antique looking sewing machine.

Food: Pretty fresh and good quality for AYCE hotpot place. The pork bone and winter melon soup bases were pretty decent.

The decor is inspired by nostalgic items like old telephones, bicycles and even a KTV up front where you can sing old pop songs (who doesn't want to sing while eating hotpot!). You can choose from a communal pot or individual. The individual pot is very cute; kind of like a bucket and the communal is the standard pot where you can do 2 flavors of soup in. The meat is really fresh; much fresher than other AYCE hot pot places in the area. Waiters/waitresses were attentive and they even gave you bags for your clothes and hair bands for your hair.

I've been to a lot of places and there are a few things that make a hot pot place top notch for me. 1) A good sauce bar - I like mixing my own dip and sauces for my veggies. This spot has a sauce bar that has EVERYTHING. They refill often. Things are in English, its a good time. 2) All you can eat - It just makes the whole experience casual, you know? When you have to tally up the price of things and worry about buying too much...it isn't as fun. So I always like when I place is all you can eat. 3) Good price - Everyone likes a good price.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,20330,"WOW. I never thought I would ever give an AYCE place five stars, but this place truly deserves it. Everything from the food, environment, and service was amazing. Coming on a Saturday at 9:30pm, there was no wait. It was still packed at this time, but for a table for two, I was seated immediately. Since this place is quite smaller than other AYCE places, the wait can be long on a busy day. Need to wait?! No worries! They have a small console for you at the waiting area where you can play your games and wait at the same time. Great for adults and kids haha!The decorations. LOVE. I am a huge fan of wooden anything, and this place just blows my mind. Really well designed. I love the projector MTV screen to listen and watch your music videos. Love the variety of music they play to accommodate the crowd, from English to Cantonese to Mandarin songs. Great choices of songs as well. Oh the service. Spectacular from the start. I wish I got the girl's name that was serving me because she was so kind and attentive. Upon seating, she quickly offered us a wet napkin to wipe our hands down and constantly coming back to ask us if everything was okay. Food came in a quick manor and everything we ordered was served. Hate it when I order something and they just constantly forget, but not the case here!For an AYCE hot pot place, food was fresh and good. They offer some other stuff like fish roe balls, beef tendon balls, fried tofu skin, and different soup bases at no extra cost which is great! If you check in on Yelp, they give you a free seafood platter which consists of scallops, red surf clams, mussels, and prawns. At the end of your meal, you get free ice cream, yakult, and cotton candy. How awesome is that?!I'm really glad I decided to come here and I was not disappointed.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,194555,"I've been to so many hotpot places in the city (99 favor, hometown, icook, little lamb, mister hotpot) and this one is by far my favorite! Here's why:1) Thinly sliced meat!! This is the most important aspect of hotpot and shows the quality of the place. Hotpot is all about thinly sliced meat and the thinner, the better. To those who prefer thick slices, this is not your place (and why would anyone want thick slices?!) Go to the overrated 99 if you want gross, chewy thick slices of meat. If you know anything about authentic hotpot, it needs thin slices and this place hits it on point! 2) Fatty meats - I love my thinly sliced meats fatty, that's why its called FATTY BEEF and FATTY LAMB. Ain't no one on a diet going to eat hotpot, go eat a salad! Most places call their meats ""fatty"" but they're drier than the Sahara desert. This place does a great job with their meat and providing a good fat to meat ratio! 3) Broth - their broth is pretty damn good. Can't say it's the best, but it's better than most places that are priced higher. 4) Price - can't beat $21.95 for ayce! Same price as most joints and much better food+service.5) Service - great service! Super friendly even though I don't speak Mandarin, the staff tried. They speak decent English and work hard to refill the soup and bring out the food quickly. Also, I went on Chinese New Year and they let me pick a ""red pocket"" with a random free ingredient written inside -- got the shrimp paste for free! Super good, strong shrimp taste and my bf who usually hates paste loved it! I thought this was a nice gesture and look forward to seeing these kind of events for other holidays.6) Live Music - Not sure if they only do this on certain days, but there were people who went up to sing on the karaoke machine. (On a separate note, I read reviews where people said they didn't like how only performers could go sing, but just to comment on that, I wouldn't want to hear someone who cant sing while eating my meal as that would ruin my appetite.) Anyway, back to the live music -- the two guys who sang were awesome!! My bf is a huge fan of those songs (I'm not really into Chinese songs, more like a Rihanna, Beyonce, Drake type of girl) and he couldn't tell the difference between the singer and the original artist! Kudos to the singers! Music is a bit loud though, but maybe it was because we were so close to the karaoke machine. Reminds me of the KTV days lol. 7) Decor - super cute!! I love what they did with the place -- even the bathroom is dope! Saw the guy answer an antique phone and was impressed that it worked (thought it was for decor only). The only thing is that the lighting is a bit dim for my preference. Slightly brighter would be better since the lighting made me sleepy...and I couldn't get a good Instagram pic :'( Aside from the lighting, decor and ambiance was great!

We arrived a little late and it was a packed house but we got seated right away even though our party weren't all here. Since we had a party of 10, we were seated on 2 tables right next to each other which was fine (1 table sat 4 and the other sat 6). They place your coats/jackets in bags so that it doesn't smell like hotpot afterwards. Laojie Hotpot is all you can eat for $21.95 and you have the option to order individual soup bowls or to share a large bowl with 2 soup broths of your choice. My table had 6 so we all decided to order 2 large soup bowls to share. The soup broths we ordered were bone cylinder with hot&spicy and dark chicken, satay, wolf berry for an extra ($3) with bone cylinder. As we placed our orders for meats, seafood, side orders, noodles and veggies our server Alex gave us 2 orders of everything without us asking. There is a sauce station that you can go to, to help yourself with however you like your dipping sauce to be. Everything tasted fresh and cleaned properly.

Unlike how other ayce places forget orders or give you the wrong thing, they check in when you're about halfway through your orders. The decor is very similar to hometown hotpot, but a little fancier.For soup bases, we got the hot and spicy, pork bone and herbal. I think everything tastes better in hot and spicy soup, but it's not too spicy here at least for me. For ayce, they are better than a lot of other places in terms of food. The pork belly, beef and lamb were all good! The fish slices and Fujianese fish balls are pretty good here as well. I was a little disappointed with the fish paste as it was just too starchy. Everything else was pretty standard. They also gave us the lobster, which was pretty good. You get a free lobster for your birthday, just show your ID or bring a cake. I would definitely come back, but maybe at less popular times. All those pots of soup boiling at once, it can feel like a hotpot sauna in here!",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,9.60000038147,"birthday,reservation,family,place,ventilation,advance,lobster,Everyone,sweater,anything,ayce places,soup,everything,decor,places,orders,orders,hometown hotpot,ayce,Everything,herbal,soup bases,lobster,least,terms,food,lot,beef,birthday,pork bone,thing,soup,ID,times,pots,hotpot sauna,cake,pork belly,lamb,fish balls,fish paste,fish slices,Fujianese","4,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.17348022759,0.140110358596,0.107958264649,0.0718945637345,0.0555423125625,0.0469465702772,0.0281887035817,0.0274356696755,0.0179192852229,0.0178542472422,0.0151096070185,0.0150454454124,0.0150454454124,0.0146942064166,0.0137472944334,0.0137456022203,0.0137456022203,0.0137139344588,0.0125059345737,0.0122048519552,0.0120013421401,0.0120013421401,0.011955074966,0.010962350294,0.0109438365325,0.0109438365325,0.0109438365325,0.0109275309369,0.00928092002869,0.00885666441172,0.00854618102312,0.00705461716279,0.00606811139733,0.00561890099198,0.00561430724338,0.00561430724338,0.00483033526689,0.00473586795852,0.00358320958912,0.00357842608355,0.00357410428114,0.00335860624909,0.00211815582588"
Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,6357,"So, I initially figured that the best place for ayce hot pot was 99 favor. That was until I came to Laojie. Firstly, the decor is wonderful and the ambience is really nice. The place is on the smaller side in terms of size, but it makes up for it with everything it does. The price is around 22ish per person, which I think is perfectly reasonable. There are a couple of soup base choices and they are all delicious. You have the choice of individual pots or a shared pot. The selection is pretty large and the quality is really good. What I really think sets Laojie apart from other hot pot places is the service. The wait staff is friendly, even when you are bombarding them with random requests. They actually come to you periodically as opposed to having to flag them down.

Customer service:  Everyone from the host and front desk who warmly greeted us, to the manager who made sure we always had napkins and other utensils, to the waitress who made sure to get rid of all the floating fat/oil in our stock every 10 minutes or so, refill our soup base, change our bowls, all did it without us having to wave them down even once.  They even put our coats and scarves in a plastic bag so it didn't take up space or smell, and brought it out with our check without us having to ask.Quality of food:  I normally order additional supplementary items at a AYCE, but the quality, variety and freshness of their inclusive choices were great so I stuck to it and ordered a pitcher of fresh cucumber honey juice to share.  Hotpot menu items included fish filet, fresh shrimp, live blue crab, tofu skin, fuzhou fishballs, a page full of mushrooms, vegetables, and more.  The fatty lamb and fatty beef were both great quality, I enjoyed the lamb more.  Everything was neatly presented and fresh. The cucumber honey juice was very refreshing and paired perfectly with the hotpot.  The only downfall is the sauce station is kind of small since there was only 1 of each sauce and so there was sometimes a small line of people waiting to make their sauce. The soup base itself wasn't the most flavorful or delicious- I wouldn't drink it on it's own.   I prefer Mister Hotpot's bone broth soup base over Laojie's.The decor was really vintage and fun, the music was great- they had a mixture of chinese pop songs to american music.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.5,9.80000019073,"quality,Everyone,AYCE,quality,restaurant,Laojie Hotpot,bag,service,customer service,food,soup base,cleanliness,atmosphere,taste,waitress,Customer service,people,price,ventilation,weather,soup base,space,menu items,items,food,cucumber honey juice,bowls,stock,fat,oil,utensils,napkins,manager,desk,host,coats,scarves,smell,check,hotpot,variety,pitcher,freshness,choices,fish filet,sauce,sauce station,downfall,line,sauce,music,bone broth soup base,quality,decor,music,fatty lamb,pop songs,mixture,fun,cucumber honey juice,Mister Hotpot,fuzhou fishballs,fatty,lamb,Everything,tofu skin,page,mushrooms,vegetables,more,shrimp,blue crab,beef","7,1,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,5,7,5,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.138226315379,0.0717542618513,0.0646525919437,0.058070667088,0.0572181381285,0.0551843643188,0.0507663153112,0.031353674829,0.0295913834125,0.0286814644933,0.025237172842,0.025113273412,0.025113273412,0.0249852184206,0.0171336811036,0.0119072459638,0.0110494270921,0.00956262089312,0.00952786114067,0.00950098689646,0.00804277416319,0.00743769854307,0.00719754444435,0.00668209604919,0.00668209604919,0.00668209604919,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00640138052404,0.00638889195397,0.00638889195397,0.00638889195397,0.00638889195397,0.00587428268045,0.00584669271484,0.00584669271484,0.00584669271484,0.00584669271484,0.00583680905402,0.00545192835853,0.0053140250966,0.0053140250966,0.00462255161256,0.00423126341775,0.00409233057871,0.00376768875867,0.00363792246208,0.0035804072395,0.00342683913186,0.00320040341467,0.00299810082652,0.00299810082652,0.00299810082652,0.00260062306188,0.00240063178353,0.00218638963997,0.00218312605284,0.00215561455116,0.00192052370403,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00191277056001,0.00190991535783"
Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,3390,"A seeming lifetime ago, I had a colleague who shared my, let's just say, extreme enthusiasm for exploring Manhattan Chinatown, which was near our office.  One day he insisted on taking me and a coworker to have hotpot for lunch.  He ordered all the soup ingredients and cooked them for us too.  I don't know what I loved more.  Being catered to like that or the food.  What I do know is that I've always remembered the experience and longed to hotpot (can it be a verb?) again. Recently, I had my chance:Anyway, as others have mentioned, this is a funky little place with a huge Karaoke screen front and center, displaying non-stop lyrics.  Loved the cheerful welcome we received when we entered and the delicious melon juice to placate us as we waited for a table.  Indeed, on a Monday night, this spot was packed!As for the food, am not gonna lie, figuring out what to order was DAUNTING. I had zero clue and while our server was sweet as can be, I found myself wishing she'd been better equipped to give newbies like us a mini-tutorial on how to hotpot (if it's not a verb it should be.).  I wound up ordering half Pork Bone Broth and half Spicy.  The Spicy was sooo aromatic and well, spicy. It was fun trying to figure out what was in it.  Sichuan peppercorns?  Star anise?  I don't know, but it was my favorite by far.  We stayed pretty basic in terms of add-ins, and all were fine.  But I would not get the Shrimp again. These were super awkward to shell and eat.Am not really into the whole Yelp Check-In schtick.  At all.  But somehow or another, our server managed to cajole me into doing it in exchange for a free 'Seafood Combo.'  Well, this thing was either impressive or intimidating.  I couldn't decide.  But we especially enjoyed the Clams and Mussels, though next time I'd be more careful cooking and keeping track of them since some got lost in the broth.  If you happen to be a lush like me, note that there is a VERY minimal beer selection and wine is only available by the bottle.  We sprung for a $22 bottle of white that wasn't bad at all.:)If I had it to do over again, I'd definitely sample the various condiments at the Sauce Station, which we neglected to do on this visit.  And I'd make sure we got some Cotton Candy at the end, which was not offered to us this time around.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,12.3000001907,"colleague,Manhattan Chinatown,hotpot,chance,soup ingredients,enthusiasm,office,lifetime,Spicy,server,hotpot,mini-tutorial,coworker,lunch,end,bottle,food,more,others,Sauce Station,Shrimp,food,verb,welcome,newbies,screen,front,center,lyrics,table,melon juice,clue,favorite,Sichuan peppercorns,Star anise,terms,add-ins,beer selection,wine,lush,broth,some,bottle,spot,experience,Mussels,cooking,Pork Bone Broth,Clams,track,Karaoke,all,visit,condiments,white,all,thing,schtick,exchange,another,Cotton Candy,eat.Am,Check-In,Yelp,Seafood Combo","1,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,3,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,5","0.165114209056,0.147749215364,0.0811505541205,0.0718248412013,0.0499044023454,0.0415071249008,0.0415071249008,0.0415071249008,0.0374836288393,0.0278711207211,0.0226503852755,0.0223647337407,0.0198300536722,0.0198300536722,0.0101705286652,0.0089138513431,0.00856879167259,0.0075193727389,0.00745366420597,0.00719751371071,0.00586950406432,0.00573600828648,0.00572908623144,0.00522023718804,0.00520698074251,0.00503303203732,0.00503303203732,0.00503303203732,0.00503303203732,0.00502552650869,0.00502552650869,0.00501276366413,0.00486043654382,0.00456926645711,0.00456553092226,0.0045587210916,0.0045587210916,0.00420527951792,0.00415231706575,0.00415231706575,0.0038767058868,0.0038767058868,0.00387477921322,0.00384607654996,0.0038223026786,0.00339177227579,0.00339177227579,0.00338857271709,0.0033490457572,0.00330685731024,0.00297992839478,0.00248141027987,0.00234594196081,0.00234594196081,0.00234594196081,0.00187363952864,0.00177841424011,0.00149171974044,0.00148991751485,0.00148991751485,0.0010236374801,0.000882852938958,0.000882852938958,0.000882852938958,0.000881786167156"

They even had radio players or tvs from back in the day. Definitely a nostalgic place for the older generation. They pretty much had all the food items you would find at a typical hotpot place. I only had the Cylinder Pork Bone broth and it was so flavorful you would wanna make a noodle soup out of it after you're done. The meats there are sliced so thinly which helps absorb more flavor. The waiters and waitresses provided phenomenal service. They greeted us all with smiles, were super attentive and super accommodating.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,194446,"Went here for lunch today with 6 adults and 5 kids. For a Chinese place it was very kid friendly, they had cotton candy for the kids and a old school wanna be nes system for the kids to play with in the front. The food was very fresh, the crabs were still moving when it came to our table. The sauce bar had all the choices I think most people will need. The pork bone broth was really tasty, I didn't really need the sauce. Didn't have flag down the staff for more food, they just kept on showing up to our table to ask if we needed more food. The only con to me was the fatty beef was a little too thin, it melts (breaks up) into the broth if you keep it in for more than 5 seconds.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,6504,"I am first to review this new establishment and first to put this restaurant on yelp it seems, since it's not in the yelp searches.  The worker at this restaurant said they open only a month ago so it's a very new all-you-can-eat hot pot places. In 8th avenue there are two other notable hotpot places, 99 flavor taste and hangout58 (fort Hamilton). Anyways, We ended finding this restaurant while trying to go try another new restaurant along the block, we saw this restaurant first and my friend is a fan of new restaurant and hotpot places so we went into this restaurant instead.The decor is quite unique. The seating is contemporary with some bench seating and some individual chairs. The holders for the Veggies and the metal cups for drinks is different but unique. Most of the walls have wooden and brick design for a comfortable southern home style feel. The food came out presentable. The service I say is great. The staff is attentive but not in your face. Comes at the appropriate times during when service is needed. Refills the pots with soup without asking and even remove the oily fat from the soup when it over flows and see it coming up without asking. It's little things like these that make their service A+ in my book. Secondly, they offer dessert at the end with tapioca sweet soup. They don't rush you to leave and let's you determine when you are done eating. Again a sign of good service.They are known to have karaoke and music at this establishment and even have a nice mic and karaoke setup. However, only problem. It's not for guests to sing. The staff say they hire a singer to come sing during certain hours in the day when restaurant is open. This makes no sense to me. If they promote outside that there is karaoke. They should allow diners to sing and pick out songs. That would only make sense. For that I can't give this place five stars. However I do like that this place has music and karaoke playing so diners can enjoy the environment, food, and music. The music that is played is comfortable smooth Asian music with some famous American flare.Next goes the true test of a good place. As many of you know I have a very sensitive stomach and have had stomach pain and need to use restroom due to unclean food or places. A few of the hotpot places I had previous went to also gave me the same problem. I think the only place that didn't was hangout58. But their service and some staff attitudes needs improvement. Anyways, back to the review of this place, so because of this I feel some of the food is not clean. Probably the veggies. I had stomach pain and had to use the restroom asap. In addition I dislike that there was only one bathroom for male and female. Felt like rushed to get out of the restroom. Not good. As a result for this reason I also cannot give them five stars. They have a great concept, a good execution plan, good service. Just some minor things that can be improved and needs teaking out. Flavor Taste 99 is a great place too but it seems as you go too much, service towards the person starts to decline for that reason I don't  like to be a regular at any place.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.10000000149,22.0,"restaurant,yelp,yelp searches,music,establishment,friend,places,hotpot places,flavor taste,restaurant,restaurant,avenue,hangout58,fort,worker,few,things,places,restaurant,restaurant,guests,fat,Hamilton,A+,seating,restaurant,place,service,hotpot,decor,holders,Flavor Taste 99,place,bench seating,service,service.,staff,place,karaoke,food,block,chairs,drinks,walls,diners,Most,music,things,karaoke,soup,soup,soup,place,some,karaoke,food,restroom,restroom,establishment,problem,service,diners,service,Veggies,brick,feel,style,design,home,face,times,pots,flows,book,dessert,end,karaoke setup,mic,sign,food,singer,songs,playing,environment,place,sense,bathroom,sense,veggies,stomach pain,service,stars,music,staff attitudes,review,female,addition,improvement,regular,place,places,hotpot places,restroom,reason,reason,result,concept,execution plan,person,staff,music,food,stars,stomach,stomach pain,problem,test,flare.,American,Asian,Next,many","2,7,7,5,7,1,2,2,7,2,2,2,7,2,1,1,7,2,2,2,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,1,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,4,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,5,7,4,7,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,5,1","0.255230814219,0.0341723896563,0.0299291685224,0.029672851786,0.0282960589975,0.0276751443744,0.0263798199594,0.0246430076659,0.0162243787199,0.0161744412035,0.0153773827478,0.0142009435222,0.0142009435222,0.0142009435222,0.013231344521,0.0111077371985,0.0104677574709,0.0100140580907,0.0097537804395,0.0097537804395,0.00959651172161,0.00916972197592,0.00841669365764,0.00841397978365,0.00754663487896,0.00723856687546,0.00722086662427,0.00698684295639,0.00679392088205,0.00662215519696,0.00658823410049,0.0065661855042,0.00628504762426,0.0061623705551,0.00569061236456,0.00566366314888,0.00555339967832,0.00551034230739,0.00548763992265,0.00541615439579,0.00540721230209,0.00539194652811,0.00537950545549,0.00536900898442,0.00525254430249,0.0051687550731,0.00515157496557,0.00489030731842,0.00485124439001,0.00452382676303,0.00452382676303,0.00451499782503,0.00450642826036,0.004501005169,0.00441439356655,0.00441439356655,0.00438565015793,0.00438238121569,0.00409970525652,0.00409655598924,0.00384175544605,0.00373650947586,0.00373195204884,0.00364060723223,0.00362468650565,0.00362468650565,0.00362468650565,0.00362468650565,0.00362468650565,0.0036083352752,0.00360397831537,0.00360000529326,0.00360000529326,0.00359635450877,0.00359297753312,0.00359297753312,0.00358690088615,0.00358690088615,0.00358690088615,0.00328907300718,0.00327517511323,0.00326909357682,0.0032637999393,0.00322268414311,0.00311016757041,0.00290319602937,0.00290052057244,0.00289805606008,0.00277823535725,0.00277715176344,0.00265190610662,0.00265049329028,0.00245451065712,0.00243260362186,0.00243159220554,0.00242874585092,0.00242874585092,0.00206288928166,0.00205537700094,0.00198109913617,0.00198015128262,0.00197923812084,0.00192857300863,0.00191981869284,0.00191792147234,0.00167955481447,0.00167898682412,0.00167898682412,0.00167789496481,0.00165184424259,0.00153600797057,0.00144496501889,0.00136312819086,0.00134244875517,0.00122093723621,0.0012203741353,0.00106862350367,0.00106862350367,0.000632418494206,0.000632418494206,0.000632418494206,0.000588394876104"

Unfortunately, this winter I barely had time to visit home, so I missed out on my mom's amazing hotpot. That's ok, though. Laojie Hotpot totally made up for it and more. This place an absolute gem! First of all, $21.95 for ALL you can eat is amazing.  Second, service was phenomenal. Third, the food was SO good. -Since I came with a large group, I got to try 4 soup bases: spicy, bone soup, herbal, and mushroom. My favorite was bone soup. -I love the fact that you can make your own dipping sauce, tailored to your own taste preference - they had all the sauces (peanut, oyster, bbq, spicy, etc) imaginable plus garnishes! -Drinks are cheap, too - a corona was about $2-3 (in Manhattan's Koreatown, I've paid $6......). -The selection of meat, fish balls, veggies were on point. I tried pig's blood, which I had never had before... got to check that off my bucket list. -They played karaoke music at the front of the restaurant and had a big projector screen showing the karaoke lyrics, and it consisted of a mix of Chinese, English, and Korean songs. That was pretty fun. They even had a mic up at the front of the stage, but no one sang. -For the free desserts, you get cotton candy and little Yalkut drinks that you can take home!  -There was only 1 bathroom, but it was super clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.Overall, I loved this place.

Everyone in your party can have their own pot which will be regularly refilled and can be set on their personal burner at whatever temperature they see fit. It really is quite fun. Now back to that important comment about an unlimited menu: it is unlimited! Laojie is one of two restaurants I have ever dinned at where unlimited is as good as it sounds. The food is amazing and comes out quickly. The wait staff is attentive even though the fixed meal price would not seem to incentivize it. My favorites are the fatty beef and fried tofu skin. However, the roe dumplings are also amazing. Everything is so tasty. The service once you sit is amazing. And don't miss the sauce bar! While waiting for your food, hop up and make your own sauce mix.Really this would be a five star spot if they could manage the front-end operations more smoothly. I am a big Laojie fan.",4.0 star rating,"Hartford, CT",2,1,0.40000000596,8.0,"fan,dinner,Laojie,Laojie,occasions,partner,thing,pot,sauce mix.,is.My,reservation,pots,food,hotpot experience,menu,party,Everyone,menu,temperature,burner,Everything,comment,restaurants,service,food,sauce bar,roe dumplings,operations,fatty beef,wait staff,meal price,tofu skin,favorites","1,4,7,1,4,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,1,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1","0.328981876373,0.284907966852,0.0644747614861,0.0519274063408,0.0494472645223,0.0348619222641,0.0179204177111,0.0155482292175,0.014424001798,0.0138077409938,0.0114774107933,0.00932827964425,0.00777290668339,0.00752531504259,0.00702361017466,0.00699811056256,0.00673762941733,0.006372529082,0.00636152690277,0.00612466549501,0.00578162167221,0.00557693839073,0.00556607171893,0.00505448738113,0.00470857089385,0.00412387773395,0.00388271198608,0.00285363849252,0.00276135234162,0.00222914875485,0.00191461108625,0.00181751803029,0.00170588598121"

This place is a AYCE and it is $21.95 per person which is a great deal since they serve a lot of items that other AYCE places don't (beef tongue, fish paste, kani, and etc...) They have a great variety of soup bases which I like. You can also choose to have either individual pots or shared pots but my party decided to go with the individuals. Also, if you check in on Yelp you get a complimentary seafood platter! In the platter, there are snow crab legs, clams, shrimp and surf clams. Besides the AYCE menu you can also order additional dishes, and that day I tried the abalone which was a tiny bit salty but still pretty ok.

Love that they have cassette tape collections hanging on their walls. 90's pop stars portraits bought back lots of memories.  The decor deserves a star. We immediately got acknowledged and got seated.  Ready to ordered.  First they mistaken our ordered but gladly took it back and offer us complimentary oysters.  Food was fresh and service was understanding.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,48016,"There's pros and cons about this place. Went here on a Monday thinking it won't be sooo packed but end up waiting for 45 mins. I could have left since I don't like waiting for more than 15 mins but from what I've read from other yelpers and just the look of the interior I just had to try it out. The cons about the place is that the place is a little bit to small and not a lot of space in between tables. They need to update their system on how many customers are coming in and who has reservations and who actually came first. I felt like I was being skipped because I saw people leaving and people being seated that came in after me like they forgot I was there waiting for 45 mins. Another thing is they need to have English in the sauce station. I don't read Chinese so I didn't know what was what and I was standing there for a long time just figuring out what I'm using was the right sauce and hoping I didn't put anything spicy. The pros about this place is that the service was great. The waiters made sure you had what you wanted and they were fast on bringing the food out. This was the first place that I have ever been to that didn't miss a single item that we asked for. Other places I've been too always miss 3 - 4 things when I order something. This place doesn't go cheap on the amount of food they bring out. It is always the same amount every time. Other places I've been too, by the second round they bring out like half the amount but not this place. I didn't feel rushed and they actually let us take our time to eat.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,42120,"My new favorite hotpot place! I was a big proponent of 99 Favor Taste before but all they have on Laojie Hotpot is that they have pancake sauce and more ice cream flavors. The service here is easily the best I've had. The waiters and waitresses brought our food almost instantly after we ordered it, came over to ask whether we wanted more every time we even so much as glanced at the menu, skimmed fat off our soup, came by with soup refills...you name it, they were on top of their game.As for the actual food, we ordered the dark chicken, satay, and wolfberry broth (no longer an additional $3) and the hot & spicy broth. The hot & spicy broth was definitely the standout star for me, as it gave everything a fragrant kick. I was impressed that you could get homemade fish paste and live crab for no additional cost. The rest of the standard hot pot staples tasted fresh and delicious as well. When we finished our meal, a waitress asked if we wanted ice cream (flavors: strawberry and mango). She brought them out with yakult drinks and told us to just let her know if we wanted more. We took her up on her offer and requested more yogurt drinks. The check also came with two melon candies!Upon exiting, I noticed they had a cotton candy machine near the door.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,165549,"This is my second visit, I had a pleasant experience the first time around and wanted to bring my parents here. I called in for a reservation for 4 people @8pm on Friday night (10/6), my reservation was accepted with no concerns or comments.I showed up with my parents & boyfriend with 5 minutes to spare (7:55) and was told I would need to wait ~ 30 minutes but it may be sooner. I saw that my name was on the top of their waitlist with other names below me already scratched off, I agreed and sat down thinking I was next in line for a table. At about 8:20 they offered us a winter melon (or some other gourd) blended juice drink for our wait. It helped with our hunger and was very considerate of them. In the end I was really disappointed as I saw two parties who arrived after us seated before us. Ultimately we were seated around 8:40. That's 40 minutes past our reservation. The reason why my review isn't lower than what is currently is is due to my experience thereafter. Although my initial experience was the worse, our waitress Candice really did it for me. Many of the AYCE hotspots in the area are generally the same thing, but her service and attitude are far superior to what I've experienced elsewhere. As soon as we sat down she was already waiting at our table side greeting us and ready for our order.She was calm, patient, and very helpful in all our requests and inquiries. My parents are your typical Asian parents: loud, talkative, nosy, and takes pictures of everywhere and thing. My dad was constantly moving around and asking for more things, and my mom just kept pointing at everything. Candice treated them with great care and a smile. (A plus too since she spoke fluent English & Chinese and could understand my parents whenever they butt into my requests to assist them as well ) The food is always superb, my favorite is tomato soup base or the cylinder bone. They always bring a hearty looking plate of beef whenever we order ( unlike other AYCE that only bring out a plate with like 10 slices of beef). Don't forget to check in for your arctic scallops! It's free so don't expect to be bedazzled by it.  After placing and finalizing our first order, I went to their sauce station and before I was even back to my table, the soups were already situated and ready to go alongside our first platter of food.Overall after my initial experience everything was great.

We were seated promptly for our reservation for 4 on Friday night and the service was amazingly friendly, constantly cleaning, clearing plates, checking in on us with a smile. Appreciated how we could have the option for a shared big pot or individual pots. We opted for our own pots since our friend was hacking up half her lung. I chose the Bone Cylinder Soup and it was pretty flavorful, a milky broth with a bone, corn and tomatoes bobbing inside. They have their own mixing section for sauces, but their House Special Sauce was tasty and made my job easier.When you check in on WeChat, Facebook or Yelp, they give you a free seafood platter. The rest of the ingredients we ordered was fresh and came in generous portions. Especially loved how they gave us Yakult drinks, a scoop of ice cream and cotton candy at the end.

I also ordered some of the beef and fish, and got a free seafood platter for checking in. All of the veggies were good, and we ordered seconds on some of the tofu items.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,106434,"Keeping this as 5 star after 2 visits here. This place trumps over 99 Favor at 61st. It is fairly new. Their utensils, the decorations, the food is amazing. Package is everything. Their place just looks clean, despite it being in 8 ave. The only problem I have is that their fish roe balls doesn't taste as good as the original fish roe balls because, fish roe balls are expensive and it's an AYCE hotpot so I guess they can't get the good quality ones. If you check in, you get a free dish of surf clams which I think is a very generous offer. There's this waitress who is BEYOND amazing and professional. We gave her over 25% tip because of her professionalism. I honestly forgot her name but it started with a J. Possibly something like Janie or Janice or something. But she will observe your table and ask you if you want more of this and that instead of just asking what do you need. She is really nice and extremely friendly ! I would come back here very soon !

The price coupled with the menu options continues to surprise and make me happy. The wait staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Typical AYCE hot pot places are eager to get you out the door and to limit the amount of meats delivered to your table. This place is happily the exact opposite. In my numerous experiences (and I have eaten here many times) the wait staff is always near to replenish trays of menu items. I also enjoy that the spicy hot pot can be adjusted to your preferred spice level. After 4 to 5 additional spice increases, our pot starts to taste very similar to Chengdu and Mianyang style hot pot restaurants. The place gets crowded normally after 7:00PM (with good reason--too good of a place not to go). It's also a nice experience when customers start to partake in the free karaoke.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,194360,"Disclaimer: I am not super experienced with hot pot. I only got introduced to hot pot 5 years ago. Despite that I have had hot pot outside of NY in Beijing, Chengdu, and Xian. This is the best hot pot place I have ever been to. Firstly, their service is probably what makes this place so great. You will never be waiting for food. I've been here when it's really busy and when there's barely anyone else there. During both time they are quick to get you to order and everything comes out pretty quick.Second reason why this place is great is the quality and choice of the ingredients. They have fresh meats and seafoods of all different varieties. They also have super fresh and unique veggies. Some top contenders are: fish fillet, fatty beef, lamb, shrimp and ever tofu you could ever want. They also have things that other places don't usually have like corn, potato, taro, handmade fish paste etc. Lastly their broths are fantastic. I usually go for half herbal half spicy. Compared to places like 99 favor this place is 1000x better at their broths. I recently tried their pork bone and it's also really good.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,9.10000038147,"place,pot,Disclaimer,pot,quality,contenders,broths,place,service,pork bone,everything,anyone,food,choice,ingredients,meats,seafoods,varieties,veggies,NY,Beijing,Chengdu,Xian,things,place,places,corn,potato,taro,fish paste,half,fish fillet,places,fatty beef,lamb,shrimp","7,6,5,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2,1,7,7,2,7,6,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7","0.302269160748,0.127948582172,0.0954075455666,0.0615381523967,0.0552423708141,0.0439581759274,0.0218097008765,0.021631328389,0.0213326886296,0.0156842768192,0.0156620591879,0.013652025722,0.0117526389658,0.0107174990699,0.0107174990699,0.0107015380636,0.0107015380636,0.0107015380636,0.0106872813776,0.0104009034112,0.0104009034112,0.0104009034112,0.0104009034112,0.00890928693116,0.00831459090114,0.00831459090114,0.0079694185406,0.0079694185406,0.0079694185406,0.0079694185406,0.00795387756079,0.00531943421811,0.0050876904279,0.00350121362135,0.00350121362135,0.00350121362135"
Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,32300,"Yes - another hot pot place, but Laojie isn't just another place that is jumping on the hotpot bandwagon. They're a prime example of doing something and doing it well. The decor is absolutely amazing. The walls are lined with old school Chinese music stars artwork and they also have a karaoke machine in the back so it can get quite loud. But I didn't mind the noise because it was such a throw back to my childhood. There are also a bunch of interesting knick knacks around the restaurant. My friends know how much I adore 99 Favor Taste and Laojie is right up there with 99 in terms of pricing and service. Laojie has more broth options like the Dark Chicken, Satay and Wolfberry as well as Clam, Scallop, and Wintermelon. They're an additional $3 but seeing as it is unique to Laojie, it is definitely worth it. My friend who ordered the dark chicken soup base had an actual dark chicken leg in her broth and I enjoyed the seafood and wintermelon in mine. The mushroom base was filled with fungi and also had a tiny corn cob. The service at Laojie was also excellent. There is a bit of a language barrier but you should have no problem just pointing to what you want on the menu. My favorite things on the menu were the thinly sliced meat and fish paste which is given to you with a popsicle stick to drop into your broth. If you order too much to fit on to your table, they will wheel a little cart to you that will hold the rest of your items for you. The staff also tends to jam pack your veggies into those cute wooden containers, so you might have a bit of trouble getting it out. I suggest holding it over your pot and pulling it out from there because there will be bits and pieces spilling out everywhere.Definitely check this place out if you like hot pot. It may not be as big as 99 but the service is great, the food is great and you probably won't have to wait as long for a table as 99.EDIT. I had previously mentioned that there was a family package at Laojie. I first went in December and Patrick, the manager, had mentioned they don't have it anymore so I'm removing it from my review and amending my caption in order to confusion.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,11.8999996185,"place,Laojie,noise,place,something,hotpot bandwagon,karaoke machine,music,friend,decor,example,artwork,old school,walls,Chinese,Laojie,fish paste,restaurant,back,service,childhood,knick knacks,Taste,bunch,bit,service,broth,broth,wintermelon,chicken soup base,mushroom base,Patrick,service,menu,menu,terms,pricing,Satay,broth options,mine,chicken leg,corn cob,fungi,seafood,friends,language barrier,problem,meat,popsicle stick,Laojie,pot,bits,food,trouble,place,Dark Chicken,pieces,Wintermelon,Wolfberry,Clam,Scallop,table,family package,rest,review,order,confusion,things,pot,table,bit,items,cart,containers,veggies,caption,staff","7,1,7,7,7,7,6,5,1,7,7,5,3,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1","0.174309954047,0.0838584899902,0.0662338733673,0.0567707791924,0.0547412969172,0.0452979952097,0.0304564200342,0.0301491227001,0.0293496772647,0.0263426806778,0.0216390714049,0.0214506033808,0.0214506033808,0.0214506033808,0.0127210663632,0.0113464603201,0.00986476615071,0.00932846777141,0.00820488855243,0.00819691456854,0.00818173680454,0.00816286914051,0.00814695097506,0.00766202947125,0.00763963768259,0.00691210851073,0.00688095018268,0.0062702614814,0.00625889096409,0.00625889096409,0.00625133840367,0.005790094845,0.005719861947,0.00570868933573,0.00570333143696,0.00550111662596,0.00550111662596,0.00549181643873,0.00549181643873,0.00547630991787,0.00547630991787,0.00546969985589,0.00546969985589,0.00540735386312,0.00513350311667,0.00499481614679,0.00499481614679,0.00499012740329,0.00499012740329,0.00490629673004,0.00479348283261,0.00455526728183,0.00455196853727,0.00416143285111,0.00411714334041,0.00408611819148,0.00371905951761,0.00371648417786,0.00325153302401,0.00325153302401,0.00325153302401,0.00294093950652,0.00273948558606,0.0026633918751,0.00256951479241,0.00256951479241,0.00256951479241,0.00216127815656,0.00204988801852,0.00186732888687,0.00186580105219,0.00163362140302,0.00163362140302,0.00163228472229,0.00163228472229,0.00131195317954,0.000697713752743"

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,3940,"This is probably my favorite AYCE hotpot place in Brooklyn, I still prefer mister hotpot for regular hotpot but this place is pretty darn good! Decor takes you back in time and the music is a combination of old Chinese, mandarin and modern English songs. I liked that their music wasn't tacky.. it was old school hit songs that everyone loved.. I came with my co workers who were around 40 years old and they said it reminds them of their teenage years. Service here is wonderful and they refill your pot without needing you to ask, the staff speaks English!! Which is really rare for hotpot place... haven't seen one yet. They offer you wet naps to wipe your hand as soon as you sit down. There is individual pots as well as shared pots and a large variety of food to chose from, I love that they have fried tofu skin, tomato and fish roe ball as well those are literally the only three things I eat at hotpot! Our table ordered fatty beef and it had black spots on it when we asked our server what it was she promptly took the plate to the kitchen to find out what it was... turns out it was just the specks of blood which is normal, but she went above and beyond to help us exchange the whole plate. I LOVED that she did that without us asking and didn't give us a hard time like some other ayce places.  Afterwards you get ice cream and cotton candy. It is also free on your birthday and if you check in you get a free seafood platter. I have already recommended my sister and her husband here and they love it as well!

I tried the herbal soup, and also the spicy soup. I enjoyed them both. There's a lot of red peppers and other spices in the spicy soup base. The raw food was fresh and they even have CRABS with no additional charge. That's rare and amazing. I loaded up on so many crabs that night and they were so good and fresh.Service- amazing service. Servers were fast and attentive. They kept changing our plates when our plates were dirty. And when we ran out of beef early during our dinner, they gave us more without us having to ask. That's never happened to me before.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,149028,I went to this hot pot place to check it out since I saw it as a new place near my hood. Lol. I have to say the customer service is on point and excellent. The servers would come right away with the food as soon as we put in the order. They will constantly pick up the empty plates so it's not in our way. Also would change your plates when they see it filled with bones or shells. I just love how they didn't kick me and my friends out even though we stayed for almost 3 hours. They just kept coming by asking if we needed more food. That just explains how they really want to keep their customers. I love how they have an on stage DJ singers constantly singing Chinese songs. If I was brave enough I would go up there and sing a couple of songs. Lol they have a really nice microphone set. I also love their decorations around the restaurant. I definitely want to come back soon. Excellent customer service. Came back today (1/4/2017) I really liked how they set up the table nicely when we made a reservation. The waitress was attentive and knew what she was doing. I really liked this waitress since she knows English and understood what me and my friends were saying. Other waiters and her kept coming back and refilling our soup base which is very nice. She also kept coming back to ask if we need to order anything else. Me and my friends really liked the decorations all around the restaurant. And surprisingly those antique telephones work.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,11991,"I've been on a hot pot binge lately and Laojie was next on my hit list! The lowdown: -$22/person AYCE -They take reservations!-Sauce bar! -Free ice cream, Yakult, and cotton candy for dessert! RESERVATIONS:I made reservations for two an hour before we wanted to eat. Not only were they able to fit us in, they were very accommodating when we had to switch our reservation last minute to three people. BROTH:They have a decent selection of broths to choose from. If you're dining at a smaller table, it's a communal pot, but you have the option to choose two broths. We ordered the hot & spicy and the bone cylinder (pork bone) soup base. The broths are good, but not as flavorful as Little Sheep. For $22 AYCE, I'm not complaining. FOOD & SAUCES: They have a good variety of food to dip into the hot pot, with my favorites being the fish paste, fatty beef, fish ball with roe, and tong ho. The sauce bar is pretty standard. As long as they have all my favorites, I'm happy. My go to is usually a mix of Chinese BBQ sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and soy sauce with scallions, cilantro, and garlic on the side. Tip: Mix the fish paste with the scallions and cilantro from the sauce bar before dropping it into the broth! SERVICE:Service was impeccable! When we were first seated, our waiter presented each of us with a wet towel and offered me a hair-tie! He, and other staff, would drop by, non-intrusively, to skim off the fat/foam on top of our broth. Also, he was always somehow around when we wanted to order more food. YELP CHECK-IN:The check-in special of the night was for scallops, but we received arctic surf clams (the red tipped clams). Just a heads-up if you were expecting scallops, like me.

We got the hot & spicy and bone cylinder soup base. The hot & spicy was our favorite. We stayed away from the bone cylinder, didn't have much flavor. We forgot to get up and get the sauces..... so we will save that for next time. We are thinking of getting sauces & putting it in the bone cylinder to flavor it up. Not as filling as we thought it was going to be but that's a good thing - we weren't stuffed. We only drank water. Soda might have not been a good option.

Laojie Hotpot,5395,811 53rd St,Brooklyn,11220.0,144547,"One of the best Hotpot places I have ever been to and I've had my share of Hotpot. Laojie is AYCE $21.95 per person. The value and quality of food you receive makes this place one of the better Hotpot restaurants. I appreciate that you are able to order a wide variety of options on the menu allowing you to try more and different things. Food. For someone who gets bored of one entree and like to share different dishes, this place is for you! My personal favorites include: porkbone soup-watercress, fish tofu, vermicelli, Fuzhou fish balls, shrimp, tripe, enoki mushrooms and fatty beef. If I were to get everything I wanted at another restaurant, it would be easily be almost doubled the price making this restaurant amazing in value. Check-in and you'll receive a seafood dish which has shrimp, crab claw, mussels, and scallop. The servings are small which is preferred so you can order more of a variety of items and always order more later. Service. Everyone was impressive. To the welcome and being seated. I wasn't happy with one of my stained dishes, I didn't say anything because the next second it was switched out for me. Food was expedited. The servers checked on us a few times appropriately and not overbearing which was great. They assisted us in sifting out the gross floating  remnants from the soup. Very attentive service; however one challenge for me is that they don't speak very much English which was difficult. It's okay tho because they were kind and were always willing to assist. I love this place! I await the next rainy day for a chance to dine here again.

Hanging on the dining room walls were pictures of old school movie posters such as The Young and Dangerous (greatest movie ever!), Journey to the West, and more.. There is also a video game console in the waiting area to keep you entertained while you wait for your table. And did i mention they have the entire back wall as a karaoke screen?!?! Yes, this is AYCE and All You Can Sing On to the food, both the spicy and bone broth soup bases were very good. The meat and veggies selections were pretty decent. Meat and seafood quality were very good. I believe they give you a complimentary seafood platter with clams, mussels, shrimp and such. Their sauce station looks pretty cool and is stocked with all your essentials. Once again, none of that nasty watery version of Sacha sauce, only the real type here!The servers are awesome, constantly asking if you would like to order more food, switching your plates for clean ones, they even help you order songs on the karaoke system!

Laoma Ma Latang,5396,6301 8th Ave,Brooklyn,11220.0,45305,"Flushing Queens have some of the best Sichuan food in NYC.  One of more popular casual places are to be found at various mall food courts over there by the name of LaoMa Ma LaTang.  It was one of the places I drive all the way from Brooklyn to eat at because that is nothing like it here in KIng's County.  Wait... let me correct that.  There WAS nothing like it here in King's County.A few months back, Fei Long Supermarket opened up the first Asian food court in Brooklyn's Chinatown and soon after, LaoMa Ma LaTang opened up a sister location within here.Ma La literally translates into numbing spiciness.  This will give you an indication of the type of Sichuan food you could expect here. Not only will it be spicy but it would slightly mildly numb your mouth in a pleasant way from a Sichuan only spice known as ""flower Pepper"".. They serve two types of food here, Ma LA noodle soups or pay by the pound Ma la stir fry in a large wooden bowl.  No matter which one you order, you get to choose the level of the numbing spiciness.  I think it goes from mild, medium, hot, to very hot.  Be aware that they don't play around with the spiciness here.  If you choose very hot, it WILL be very hot.The soup will come with whatever main ingredient (mine was beef) that you choose on top, and under that, a seemingly haphazard mix of cellophane noodles, veggies such as bak choy, wood ear mushrooms, firm and dried tofu and other ingredients that I can't remember as of this moment.  The more you dig into the soup, the more things you might find in there.  The soup broth, besides being spicy is also a bit oily.  The spicier your order, the more oily it gets, but that is common with Sichuan food which uses a type of spicy oil a lot to give it some extra spicy punch.  Just be aware of this before ordering. The various components never work together flavor wise as a whole but taste rather good as individual bites with the numbing flavor of the spices and broth.The Ma La Stir Fry seems to be the more popular option at all the LaoMa Ma LaTang that carries this.  The way it works is you pay for fixed price for as many different kind of veggies options that they have on display that could fit within one of their wooden baskets, choosing whatever you like, and then pay a fixed price per pound for the meat/seafood option, choosing as much and as many things as you are wiling to pay for.  You could just order veggies or just order meat/seafood if that is the way you prefer it but the more popular way is to combine a bit of the two.  When you have your selection ready, they will ask you for your preferred spice level. Wait on the side and within minutes, they would call you back to pick up a steaming wooden bowl of everything that you selected stir fried together. As with the soup, everything in the bowl would be covered in a slight sheen of  fragrant chili oil and spices.  They give out a small container of white rice with the order, two if you get it as a combo of veggies and meat/seafood.  Addition container of rice costs $1 each.  The rice is delicious mixed with the chili oil and spices.  Now enjoy.********************************************************************************Spicy level from 1 to 5, 5 being the hottest:  Up to 4 depending how hot you tell them to make it.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.10000000149,9.19999980927,"one,places,spiciness,Sichuan,food,food,mall food courts,some,option,way,Fei Long Supermarket,nothing,NYC,Flushing Queens,nothing,name,seafood,food court,Brooklyn,sister location,LaoMa Ma LaTang,order,veggies options,KIng's County,LaoMa Ma LaTang,County.,King,lot,spice,veggies,Asian,kind,display,food,noodle soups,way,two,types,soup,type,stir fry,pound,way,spices,flower,mouth,level,everything,more,soup,Ma,bowl,oil,type,soup broth,mine,one,cellophane noodles,ingredient,ingredients,things,here.Ma La,spices,spices,beef,indication,rice,flavor,flavor,price,matter,one,top,tofu,mix,bak choy,wood ear mushrooms,firm,soup,components,veggies,bites,whole,baskets,Chinatown,Pepper,bowl,bowl,chili oil,meat,seafood,white rice,chili oil,everything,order,Addition container,punch,sheen,combo,rice costs,The Ma La Stir Fry,level,container,way,hottest,veggies,meat/seafood option,two,meat,spice level,things,pound,price,selection,side,bit","1,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,3,2,2,7,7,7,2,1,2,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,1,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7","0.0826118513942,0.0525552518666,0.0512064248323,0.0476169288158,0.0439560599625,0.0433104746044,0.0397093072534,0.032840769738,0.0202047210187,0.0195700451732,0.0192210953683,0.0190768763423,0.0170717611909,0.0164368916303,0.0154859041795,0.013711870648,0.0126686803997,0.01217910368,0.0121249658987,0.0106585100293,0.0102080740035,0.0100365821272,0.00969910342246,0.00923852436244,0.00923488941044,0.00917898118496,0.00917898118496,0.00912281684577,0.00846227351576,0.00814521685243,0.00803215801716,0.00801944546402,0.00801944546402,0.00777718098834,0.00777640147135,0.00740481959656,0.0068693831563,0.00680449930951,0.00664577959105,0.00649194233119,0.00588356656954,0.00588356656954,0.00553718628362,0.00517093716189,0.00515662599355,0.00515662599355,0.00501298159361,0.00497994944453,0.00496080610901,0.00496080610901,0.00460591958836,0.00436718389392,0.00433252798393,0.00433252798393,0.00422660866752,0.00412887101993,0.00395553233102,0.00395181030035,0.00395181030035,0.00395181030035,0.00394780281931,0.003853114089,0.00385082350112,0.00384458852932,0.00368371442892,0.00366941303946,0.00360462325625,0.00360032729805,0.00360032729805,0.00359771936201,0.00347010162659,0.00347010162659,0.00345746916719,0.00345746916719,0.00345746916719,0.00345746916719,0.00345746916719,0.00345746916719,0.00336910365149,0.00319010694511,0.00317080365494,0.00314991711639,0.00314991711639,0.00314763514325,0.00306611834094,0.00305306608789,0.00294933654368,0.00294759729877,0.00294759729877,0.00294593651779,0.00294593651779,0.00294593651779,0.00294282380491,0.00268089608289,0.00267938547768,0.00267793983221,0.002448244486,0.00234543741681,0.00234411563724,0.00234285090119,0.00224217423238,0.00203629606403,0.00190254312474,0.00181332207285,0.00162022409495,0.00139388942625,0.00129588262644,0.0012949941447,0.0012949941447,0.00129415187985,0.00117858313024,0.00117858313024,0.00117858313024,0.00102967908606,0.001029041945,0.000593675300479"

I've been visiting its OG locations in Golden Shopping Mall and New World Mall for over a decade, so a visit to the first actual LaoMa restaurant has been long overdue.My verdict: LOVE. I like crossing the little bridge at the entrance to go into the restaurant. In all the times I've been here, I've only seen one lady work. I wouldn't consider her rude at all, unlike the negative reviewers below me; if anything, her service is about similar to other Chinese wait staff I've encountered throughout Flushing. Each time I've come is on a weekend during early lunch hours, so it was usually just my table when I arrived and two or so more tables when I left.The restaurant menu is considerably different from the mall menu. The ma la tang (soup) is the same, but the restaurant offers by-the-pound orders of the xiang guo (dry pot) as well as actual hot pot, and it also has marinated skewers of all kinds. So far I've dabbed my taste buds in everything except hot pot, and here are my thoughts:- Ma la tang: the portions are huge! This restaurant offers it in a big noodle bowl, which makes the portion feel about 10% bigger than when it's in the plastic container from the malls. The flavor is still the same compared to the mall version.- Ma la xiang guo: I like being able to control how much of each meat/veggie order I'm getting. There are also a lot more meat/veggie options to choose from. Finally, I feel like this is a less oily, more saucy version compared to the mall version.- Skewers: delicious.

The rice and noodles were both very greasy - and we usually are understanding that stir fried dishes use a bit more oil than most dishes, but this made everything it touched glisten and left that weird coating of oil in your mouth. The beef was rather tough, almost reminded me of the texture of steak tips, and had a slightly old sour taste.

Unlike, its newer counterparts at the other malls, they don't serve the big bowl where you choose your own ingredients, pay by the pound, and they stir fry it in a ma la spicy sauce for you.When I came to this location, it was during the height of summer, when it was sweltering hot and humid outside.  Walking into this place, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place actually had it's own room, unlike some of the stalls in this so called mall.  Considering the fact that this place actually had eating booths with fixed tables, it was comparatively fancy when judged against the many folding chairs and rickety tables used by the competing food venders,  The word is comparatively though.Although they only speak Mandarin here, there are plenty of photos of every dish with it's Chinese and English names for people to point at when ordering.  No matter which one you choose, you get to choose the level of the numbing spiciness.  I think it goes from mild, medium, hot, to very hot.  Be aware that they don't play around with the spiciness here.  If you choose very hot, it WILL be very hot.The soup will come with whatever main ingredient (mine was beef) that you choose on top, and under that, a seemingly haphazard mix of cellophane noodles, veggies such as bak choy, wood ear mushrooms, firm and dried tofu and other ingredients that I can't remember as of this moment.  The more you dig into the soup, the more things you might find in there.  The soup broth, besides being spicy is also a bit oily.  The spicier your order, the more oily it gets, but that is common with Sichuan food which uses a type of spicy oil a lot to give it some extra spicy punch.  Just be aware of this before ordering. The various components never work together flavor wise as a whole but taste rather good as individual bites with the numbing flavor of the spices and broth. As much as I enjoyed the food, I took out one star because they had one major weakness during the hotter and more humid months like the one I went here in.  There is no freakin AC in this place or the whole lower level. The longer I ate here, the more I sweated. I quickly went from eating in to ""please, please could you give me a lid for take out so that I could run away"" halfway through the meal.

Located in the New World Mall Food Court, this stand had one of the most impressive displays and the longest lines!My mom was immediately drawn to one of the diners in the food court who had one of the big food bowls. She asked what it was and where they got it and immediately got in line. Mom, as usual, was a bit overzealous, ordering the meat and seafood combo at $8 a pound. Chicken, shrimp, crab, squid, beef, pig's blood, tofu, pig ear, and tripe went into the bowl. Then a basket of veggies - napa cabbage, wood ear fungus, prince mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, seaweed - I actually had to tell my mom to stop - it was too much! After that, the lovely ladies weigh and you pay while your bowl goes to the back to be cooked at your desired level of spiciness. We got a medium.After 10 minutes, we had our food, plus some free pints of white rice which are totally recommended to temper the heat. We spent $35 (that's a lot for food court food!) and over an hour trying to finish the gigantic bowl of food - and still had leftovers. So do be really careful about how much you order! Its worse than a steam table buffet cuz you can't feel the bowl getting heavy! But the food, while pretty spicy, was super delicious. Neither one of us regretted the bowl of amazing - everything was flavorful, cooked tender, and had a good spicy/numbing kick.

The review is for the stir-fry portion only.Indeed, that large wooden bowl of spicy, flavorful, mouth-numbing stir fry is my ultimate guilty pleasure. You choose what you want (protein is charged by the pound, veggies by the basket), spice level (mild, medium, spicy), and wait for the magic to happen. There is only one type of stir fry flavor/sauce, and you're guaranteed ample amounts of garlic and green onions/scallions.My go-to protein are either fish fillets, ""prime"" beef (the heavily marbled thin slices of beef), or fish tofu.A few tips:- Let them know how many people you're ordering for, otherwise the default will be a 2-people portion- For protein, opt for thinly sliced/diced versions so the flavor will penetrate better when cooked- Go wild on the veggies! It counts by basket, not pound- Their spice level is the real deal. I can eat extremely spicy and am quite satisfied with the medium level for a regular fix. The heat builds up, so unless you're sharing, you want to be kind to your gastrointestinal tract.- Don't lean over the glass and/or point over the glass. Not only is it not hygienic for everyone else, the workers are not stupid and can understand if you tell them verbally what you want (yes, their English is perfectly fine)- It comes with 1 serving of rice by default.

They have a customizable menu where you can pick all of the different ingredients like meat, veggies and spices and toss them together. It is usually charged by the pound. This can be much cheaper than when you go to the chinese market and try to buy all of this exotic produce yourself. They serve it in a large salad like bowl with bowls of rice and you and others can do family style sharing. Because of its wealth of ingredients I usually come here to get the individual lamb hot pot or the recently renamed lamb hot and sour noodle soup. There is also a beef version. This one bowl of noodles comes with a grocery list of ingredients inside- sliced lamb, thin potato slices. chunks of wintermelon, wood ear mushrooms,  cabbage, bean curd skin, baby bok choy, onion,  fried tofu,  seaweed strands, horse radish, even rice cakes together with thin glass noodles in a spicy broth. It is kind of like having hot pot by yourself. You can choose the potency of your broth- the mild spice is spicy enough for me. I like the sourness and spice of the broth which brings a slight numbing to my mouth but the flavors are very homey and rich with a little kick from the spice which brings flavor to some of the blander items in the soup. Anything spicier than mild is bound to make me wanna dunk my head in ice water and make me grasping my stomach in pain. Soup can be dangerous.The stand has two names which is a little confusing but you can't miss it, on the left when you get off the escalator, it is the busiest one. Their bright red sign suits them like the spicy food that they serve. Once you complete your order you can go look for a seat or explore the rest of the food court.

I asked for mild, but it was pretty spicy when I ate it. I can only imagine how spicy the highest level is. We had shrimp, beef, broccoli, tofu, seaweed, watercrest, and fish balls. Since our order was over $25, we received 2 bowls of rice. I would of added noodles if I had known.  I'm glad I had some bubble tea or else my mouth would have been on fire.

LaoMa MaLaTang,5400,"New World Mall136-20 Roosevelt Ave, Ste 16",Flushing,11354.0,45305,"Ma La literally translates into numbing spiciness.  This will give you an indication of the type of Sichuan food you could expect here. Not only will it be spicy but it would slightly mildly numb your mouth in a pleasant way from a Sichuan only spice known as ""flower Pepper"".. Up until about two years ago, the only LaoMa Ma La Tang was found within the lower level of Golden Shopping Mall.  That mall was dingy and have no AC which makes eating hot spicy stuff there in the summer intolerable.When the New World Mall opened up, and  discovered that they finally opened up a second branch here, it was a breath of fresh AC cooled (and winter heated) air.  This location is also cleaner, and could accommodate a bigger group of people at once too with the vast food court space that it resides in along with many other vendors.As if that wssn't alreeady enough to get fans of LaoMa Ma La Tang to walk the few blocks here instead, this location also introduce something else besides the Ma La noodle soups that the original location carries only.  They serve two types of numbing spicy food here, Ma la noodle soups or pay by the pound Ma la stir fry in a large wooden bowl.  No matter which one you order, you get to choose the level of the numbing spiciness.  I think it goes from mild, medium, hot, to very hot.  Be aware that they don't play around with the spiciness here.  If you choose very hot, it WILL be very hot.The soup will come with whatever main ingredient (mine was beef) that you choose on top, and under that, a seemingly haphazard mix of cellophane noodles, veggies such as bak choy, wood ear mushrooms, firm and dried tofu and other ingredients that I can't remember as of this moment.  The more you dig into the soup, the more things you might find in there.  The soup broth, besides being spicy is also a bit oily.  The spicier your order, the more oily it gets, but that is common with Sichuan food which uses a type of spicy oil a lot to give it some extra spicy punch.  Just be aware of this before ordering. The various components never work together flavor wise as a whole but taste rather good as individual bites with the numbing flavor of the spices and broth.The Ma La Stir Fry seems to be the more popular option at all the LaoMa Ma LaTang that carries this.  The way it works is you pay for fixed price for as many different kind of veggies options that they have on display that could fit within one of their wooden baskets, choosing whatever you like, and then pay a fixed price per pound for the meat/seafood option, choosing as much and as many things as you are wiling to pay for.  You could just order veggies or just order meat/seafood if that is the way you prefer it but the more popular way is to combine a bit of the two.  When you have your selection ready, they will ask you for your preferred spice level. Wait on the side and within minutes, they would call you back to pick up a steaming wooden bowl of everything that you selected stir fried together. As with the soup, everything in the bowl would be covered in a slight sheen of  fragrant chili oil and spices.  They give out a small container of white rice with the order, two if you get it as a combo of veggies and meat/seafood.  Addition container of rice costs $1 each.  The rice is delicious mixed with the chili oil and spices.  Now enjoy.********************************************************************************Spicy level from 1 to 5, 5 being the hottest:  Up to 4 depending how hot you tell them to make it.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.10000000149,8.69999980927,"AC,spiciness,mall,food,Ma La,group,spice,option,noodle soups,way,level,type,flower,mouth,LaoMa,stuff,seafood,branch,Golden Shopping Mall,order,indication,veggies options,New World Mall,lot,Pepper,Sichuan,display,kind,location,Ma La Tang,two,location,soup,something,fans,location,veggies,breath,level,noodle soups,soup,way,air,spices,people,blocks,food court space,everything,food,more,types,bowl,cellophane noodles,soup broth,mine,pound,stir fry,oil,type,ingredients,ingredient,things,spices,spices,beef,rice,flavor,flavor,price,soup,matter,one,firm,tofu,top,bak choy,wood ear mushrooms,mix,Ma,components,veggies,bites,whole,vendors.As,bowl,chili oil,bowl,seafood,white rice,meat,chili oil,everything,order,Addition container,sheen,combo,rice costs,The Ma La Stir Fry,punch,level,container,LaoMa Ma LaTang,way,hottest,two,veggies,spice level,meat/seafood option,meat,things,pound,price,baskets,one,selection,side,bit","3,7,2,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,1,2,7,7,2,1,1,2,7,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,3,6,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,5,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,5,7,7","0.153749734163,0.130074039102,0.0633439198136,0.0632526651025,0.0285935997963,0.0202851556242,0.0199197698385,0.0180180296302,0.0176870115101,0.0164257064462,0.0163661502302,0.0153436316177,0.0121561698616,0.0121561698616,0.0118333315477,0.0117763280869,0.0112967966124,0.00949783809483,0.0090170186013,0.00895145628601,0.0086834942922,0.008649174124,0.0082292612642,0.00744650140405,0.00720395799726,0.00716009456664,0.00715135922655,0.00715135922655,0.00708448188379,0.00682582147419,0.00659179873765,0.00640193279833,0.00623737415299,0.00616154959425,0.00593181559816,0.00578502938151,0.00543004227802,0.00491658458486,0.00481508113444,0.00468756584451,0.00465566013008,0.00464996602386,0.00461475970224,0.00461141997948,0.00460411049426,0.00460411049426,0.00460411049426,0.00444043334574,0.00419567571953,0.00416711391881,0.00410095835105,0.00389824202284,0.00387597456574,0.00376992183737,0.00368334772065,0.00354564934969,0.00354564934969,0.00353607092984,0.00353607092984,0.00352539378218,0.00352539378218,0.00352150783874,0.00343354186043,0.00342773483135,0.00328622804955,0.00321378931403,0.0032107650768,0.0032107650768,0.00320829846896,0.00316060101613,0.00309687410481,0.00309687410481,0.00308439671062,0.00308439671062,0.00308439671062,0.00308439671062,0.00308439671062,0.00308439671062,0.00301509653218,0.00284493318759,0.00282713910565,0.00280909216963,0.00280909216963,0.00272595160641,0.00262982095592,0.00262819463387,0.00262819463387,0.00262664491311,0.00262664491311,0.00262664491311,0.00262374873273,0.00239039422013,0.00238898466341,0.00238763843663,0.00209128693677,0.00209005363286,0.00208887574263,0.00199957145378,0.00199809973128,0.00195409008302,0.0016963413218,0.00166281091515,0.0015226356918,0.00144452543464,0.00124296918511,0.00124296918511,0.00124211702496,0.00115561927669,0.00115478178486,0.00105101626832,0.00105101626832,0.00105101626832,0.000919457525015,0.000919457525015,0.000918161182199,0.00091756391339,0.000529397162609"

If you consider the fact they're really a large stall in a food court, suddenly this is a gold mine. Don't take my word for it, they're just the most popular thing in the ever evolving New World Mall food court (yelp.com/biz/new-world-m…).Big on portions and low on price, LMMT is the de facto choice for family style dining. For $17-20, groups of 3-4 can enjoy a large wooden bowl filled with an aromatic pile of veggies and meats at one's choice. Choose your meats and veggies from the display on the counter and choose anything from chicken to seafood, vegetable to tofu, all of which are weighed and priced by the pound.Some items are more gourmet than others (seafood mainly) and if you have them fill the bowl, then good luck trying to finish it. Noodles can be added to the mix as well and some styrofoam containers filled with rice will come with the meal. Beware of the heat, I've seen plenty of self-proclaimed spice lovers struggle to finish the food. The numbness around your lips will become normal midway into the meal, and make sure you have something to drink and wash it all down.My personal spice level is 3 here.

LaoMa MaLaTang,5400,"New World Mall136-20 Roosevelt Ave, Ste 16",Flushing,11354.0,39804,"LaoMa MaLaTang at the New World Mall Food Court specializes in Ma La Tang, a Cheng Du specialty. Ma La Tang literally translates to numb-spicy-hot and is basically a big, bowl of everything soup. There's also a LaoMa MaLaTang at Golden Mall, but New World Mall is more spacious and clean. For $7, you get a big bowl of Ma La Tang with your choice of protein: beef, luncheon meat (spam), beef tripe, lamb, clam, shrimp, fish, crab, or fish ball. If you're a vegetarian, there's also mushroom (enoki) or veggie Ma La Tang at $5 a bowl. Also, don't forget to specify your spiciness level. There's non spicy (but why would you come here for that?), mild spicy, medium spicy, and very spicy.I ordered the BEEF TRIPE MALATANG at medium spicy. yelp.com/biz_photos/zVHU… I can take spicier, but as Linny F. pointed out to me, anything spicier than medium spicy wouldn't be enjoyable anymore. Plus, medium spicy at Lao Ma is nothing to be trifled with. It came with a LOT of spicy oil. That, accidentally down the wrong pipe, is no joke. At first I thought there wasn't enough flavor in the soup because the spicy oil is so overpowering, but after I grew accustomed to the spice level, the soup balanced out perfectly. Yummy! My gigantic bowl was like a bottomless pit of treasures. I kept discovering new goodies that I didn't know was in my bowl. There's silken tofu, fried tofu (you dou fu), tofu skin (fu zhu), lotus root, seaweed, tree fungus (mu er), winter melon, napa cabbage, bok choy, potato, vermicelli noodles, rice cakes, and probably more that I'm forgetting to list.

I was hungry one night and didn't know what to get so I just decided to give it a go.You walk up to the counter and just pick out the meats that you want. You tell the lady. I don't like how you don't really get to pick how much goes into your bowl. She just grabs a handful and throws it in your bowl. Your price depends on the weight. I forgot the exact price but I think it was $9 a pound for meat? For the veggies, it is $8 a pound and you only get one basket full, it doesn't get weighted so they can easily ""cheat"" you of your money.I've seen them tell customers no you can't add anymore veggies to your basket even though it wasn't full.. That is deff not a pound and its a rip off. But anyways... after they weigh your food and you pay for it, you wait for your bowl. They will call your number up.Every bowl gets one free bowl of rice but if you spend more than 25, you get two free bowls of rice. If you want to order a bowl of rice, it is $1.You can also use your credit card if you spend more than $20. Their ""hot"" levels aren't too hot.

I've never ordered the noodles so I don't know what to say about it, but the ""dry hot pot"" as I would call it, is unrivaled by any other chain that tried to do the same (cough cough, incredible). You basically choose your meats and veggies and pay a price based on the weight of what you chose. If your total comes out to less than $25, you will get one cup of hot rice. If it is above, you will get two bowls. There is a credit card minimum, I believe of $20. Once you've chosen everything you want in your ""hot pot,"" you pay and they will cook it in the back. There is no buzzer or anything so you have to make sure to come back often and check if your food is ready (or just stand there waiting for it to come out.) You also get to choose a level of spice, personally I think that medium spicy is the best.

That's what you get in those giant food bowls.If it's one thing me and all of my friends can get behind, its a huge serving of ""spicy pot."" I still remember my first big heaping of it in 2009, in Beijing, De-li-cious. This Flushing food court pretty much serves the same thing, but instead of having to fly across the world to Beijing or Chengdu for it, I can come here. (I once carried on two tubs of it on a plane to HK, true story... and I might have dragged my boyfriend to a ma la xiang guo place on our only night in Chengdu.)The best part is that it's in a food court, where a lot of ma la xiang guo places are commonly found in China. At least they got that part right.This stand pretty much has everything that a typical ma la xiang guo place offers - except the thick chewy, translucent noodles I used to love in my pot. They also have the largest selection of meat I've ever seen. Vegetables are a fixed price per pound, same with meat; If you're doing vegetables only, its fixed at $9.But never fear, the girl behind the counter said noodles were also available, for an extra $2. What I ended up was getting looked like a bunch of clear thin soupy vermicelli noodles in the pot. Ok, not what I was expecting, but hey, my taste buds are still primordially happy. I ended up skipping the meat, cause I'm not used to too much meat in my ma la. The total price ended up being about $11, which is more or less pretty much the same price it is China for the same type of portions.The medium is a good medium; has a definite kick, but it lets you eat in pleasure before you feel like you're on the verge of dying. A little bit less oily than what I'm used to, but that's pretty much a good thing: you don't want to drink vats of chili oil. I wouldn't have them minded tossing the stir fry a bit longer to soak in a little bit more flavor, but here's the thing with spicy pot: You can't really go wrong.Good combos to go? Potato, tofu skin, enoki, sliced mushroom, lotus root, peppers, noodles and here's where I'd throw in a meat or two.

In fact, this is probably the only thing I get. For those who don't know what MaLaTang is, it is essentially a bowl of spicy glass noddles with a variety of toppings that include your choice of meat, bok-choy, napa cabbage, sliced potato, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, seaweed, rice cakes, winter-melon, tofu and a lot more! You can choose your spice level, so if you can't handle too much, you can have them adjust it to your liking. A bowl is less than $10 and it is a pretty good portion. I think this bowl of noodle soup is the perfect meal for the winter! Aside from the MaLaTang, the hotpot bowl is also superb~ My boyfriend and I also come here a lot to share a huge hotpot bowl, where we get to choose exactly what toppings to put in it. (They charge you by the pound and for 2-3 people you can look to spend $30-$40) A hotpot bowl is a spicy stir fry version of your favorite hotpot toppings.

You order how many pounds you want first, pick your choice(s) of meat/seafood and then your choice of vegetables.What we ordered: 4.5 POUNDS of food (the girl's eyes behind the counter widened in shock) to split between two girls and one bodybuilding dad (we ended up packing a good pound or so to go). Kind of embarrassing. Anyway, we had tripe, beef, pork, fish fillets, slices of coagulated blood, tofu, bok choy, spinach, oyster mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms and broccoli. A tiny crab claw and one lotus root snuck its way into our bowl, but that's okay.You get a bowl of white rice for each person and there's a bottle of soy sauce and chili sauce out on the front if you want to use it.Recommendations:We're a Korean family and we love spicy food. However, we do like to actually taste our food and not have our tongue and mouth become completely numb. We got the second ""level"" that they call ""a little bit spicy"" and found it to be the perfect balance.Beverage wise, order the herbal tea that comes in a red can. It's $1.50 and is supposed to be ""the correct tea"" to drink when eating spicy food. It tastes like grass jelly and as it leaves you with a cooling effect, I found that it really countered the spiciness very well. Note: Make sure to use a straw with the can just in case since it's not safe/sanitary to drink directly from the can.Price/Choices (just off the top of my head from what I remember):- $8/lb of meat or seafood: beef, chicken, pork, lamb, tripe, slices of coagulated blood slices, shrimp, blue crab, fish fillets, and imitation crab meat.-$7.50/lb of vegetables/tofu: spinach, oyster mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, bok choy, tofu, bell peppers, lotus roots, cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage.

A pound of meat/seafood is not a lot so if you grab a little of everything you like, you will end up spending at least $20.  For $20, I basically had a take out contaner full of stir-fry (like a regular styrofoam  take-out box) and one small rice.  In comparison to the other restaurants in Flushing, that's pricey.  However, the food was tasty and fragrant.  (I think it might be the 5 spice powder.  Not exactly sure what the ingredients are.)  Although we ordered mild, it was still very spicy.  So if you can't really handle any type of heat, get it with NO spice.Definitely something to try, but not sure if I would become a die hard fan of this ""poon choy"" -- Literal translation in Cantonese: ""bowl of veggies""",3.0 star rating,"Beechhurst, NY",2,0,0.0,5.30000019073,"hype,bowl,seafood,meat,lot,seafood,assortment,vegetables,meat,pricing,stir-fry,vegetables,excl,lobster,basket,clam meat,meat,pound,prince mushroom,straw mushroom,stir-fry,pork,spinach,fried tofu,chicken,beef,fish,little,everything,box,styrofoam,rice,comparison,restaurants,spice.,bowl,heat,something,type,Flushing,fan,poon choy,translation,veggies,spice powder,food,ingredients,Cantonese","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,5,7,6,7,7,2","0.109714157879,0.105134829879,0.06857573241,0.0598134472966,0.0566766150296,0.0556305386126,0.0542416423559,0.0506607294083,0.0229096915573,0.0202391147614,0.0194741412997,0.019304478541,0.0169597063214,0.0168981831521,0.0168981831521,0.0153899136931,0.0153544945642,0.013908745721,0.0130112385377,0.0130112385377,0.0118582770228,0.0113870259374,0.0113870259374,0.0113870259374,0.0113870259374,0.0113870259374,0.0113870259374,0.0113607924432,0.0113607924432,0.0103775952011,0.0103775952011,0.0103775952011,0.0103600751609,0.0103600751609,0.00879456941038,0.00784741248935,0.0076956585981,0.0076956585981,0.00669487239793,0.00613726582378,0.00604965025559,0.00532973045483,0.00532973045483,0.00532973045483,0.00415022065863,0.00405174028128,0.00317637459375,0.00315560004674"

LaoMa MaLaTang,5400,"New World Mall136-20 Roosevelt Ave, Ste 16",Flushing,11354.0,40297,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place. The concept is you that choose the meat/seafood & vegetables from behind a glass display that you want to be stir-fried into a giant pot of deliciousness. You tell the server what you want and you will watch as she fills the metal bowl, weighs it, and passes it to the kitchen. Meat/seafood are charged by weight while vegetables are charged by baskets. But this is the most frustrating part and the ONLY reason why I will not come here as often as my stomach wants me to. When I tell her I want beef, she grabs multiple handfuls of beef and dumps it into the bowl, then proceed to stare at me nonchalantly and ask me very rudely ""NEXT?"" When I tell her I do not want that much beef and only want half of what's in the container, she tells me that it's really not a lot of beef and half of that is not enough. I KNOW WHAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Then as if to get back at me, everything i order after that is dumped into the metal bowl as hard as possible. So, while she tries to dump as much meat/seafood into my bowl as possible (because it's weighed), the basket of vegetables is barely full before she refuses to put any more vegetables into it. Also, if you even freeze for a second to think about what else you want, it's too late; your metal bowl will get passed into the kitchen.   Despite the amazing flavors, LaoMa MaLaTang is far from an honest business and I do not see myself returning to this frustrating establishment ever again.

We chose the big bowl (from the right hand side, not the soup side).You pick your proteins ($8.50/lb.) which are combined with veggies ($8/bowl) and select a spice level. Not knowing what to order I asked for medium, saying I didn't want it too spicy.About five minutes after submitting your order, your number is called. Our well filled bowl ran just under $30 bucks and would have fed 3-4 with the included rice.Among the vegetables, the lotus root, sea beans (not sure about that one) and cloud ear fungus stood out, but more prosaic items fill out your bowl.The beef was tender, the shrimp was fresh, a flatfish lightly coated was excellent. Crab was a little difficult to handle. Calamari in rings were tender. The veggies were nicely cooked.The problem was the seasoning, basically just the ma la pepper, chili and maybe salt. There was a sprig of coriander for relief. I didn't taste any thing else if it was in there.  The oil used was not the best. That may have been the problem. Overall the flavor of the dish just wasn't enjoyable, my wife could hardly eat it.

LaRina Pastificio & Vino,5401,387 Myrtle Ave,Brooklyn,11205.0,11083,Found LaRina by accident and is a pleasant surprise. We were looking for something different. A neighborhood we do not normally explore and found this gem in Fort Green. Boy has Brooklyn changed for the better! Absolutely beautiful space. From tin walls to ceilings and rustic wood bar and trims just so pretty to look at. Really cozy outdoor space but we walked in on one of the hottest days this August so we couldn't sit out with the kids. They will have a sitter our next visit. Pressed for time and not enough company with us to sample more of the menu we only shared three brunch items which were all good but I needed more. We shared the Insalata mista with addition of a perfect sliced avocado. Pickled onions were a great touch. Then we skipped the breakfast and went for two pastas. Gnocchi alla sorrentina. Very tasty and not a heavy gnocchi like I'm used to. Perfect mozzarella. We also tried the smoked spaghetti carbonara. I enjoyed it as it also wasn't a carbonara I was familiar with either. It was a thick sauce rather than the the milky I grew up with. Very good. I had breakfast earlier and was really looking for early lunch so it was a tough position for us. I really wanted to try the dinner menu and wish I went for the breakfast side of the menu because the breakfast that were coming to the other tables looked really really good. If I come next time for brunch it will be on an empty stomach. I can't wait to try their dinner.

We were greeted by a friendly employee who told us to sit anywhere we liked and brought us water and menus. I wasn't very hungry so I was going to order an appetizer and husband ordered a main. I ordered the Asparagi and he, the Lasagna which was per the waiters recommendation. We also ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail. The restaurant was fairly empty with a couple of other patrons there so it was weird that the drinks took over 5 minutes to come to us but we let it slide. But then when the food took a while to come too it became a little frustrating. Anyways, food arrives and we begin to eat. The asapargi was OK. It was roasted asparagus with a poached egg, parm and some other blob of something cheesy atop. My husband was really enjoying his lasagna when all of a sudden he digs in and his fork catches a hair that was seriously cooked deep into the dish. I may or may not have gagged but ugh, you know, it's everyones worst nightmare. We stopped eating and asked for the bill. When the waiter came back to the table we showed him the treasure we found and he was really sorry. He did take the dish off the bill and if it was anything less than a hair I'd give them more stars but I can't get passed that.

The menu is varied enough and it was hard to decide because there were lots of really delicious-sounding options. We started with a salad of greens and edible blossoms that I expected to be boring but was quite flavorful and unusual (in a very good way). The two pastas we ordered were really excellent! Cooked just perfectly and really flavorful and fresh. It's clear that they take their food seriously there.

When my sister said she wanted to go to the place where she likes the lighting (they're quite nice, globes, in bunches like buds of flowers) for her birthday, I had no idea this would be some of the best modern Italian food I've had in ages. Our waiter was delightful and knew a lot about the menu and wine list. The rest of the staff left a bit to be desired. Gotta love a the vacant stares from the maitre d and other waiters. The food: shared the special burrata, which was presented as a birds nest with bitter micro greens and cherry tomatoes, doused with sriracha, next to thin crispy cornmeal crackers. As a main I went with the lemony pasta with rabbit ragu, which was insanely fresh and bright. I don't usually go in for pasta but I ate every bite of it and most of the rabbit. There was a lot of gristle and other detritus but I ate around it and the rest was so good I'm letting that go. I had a little jug of wine that perfectly complemented my meal and was spot-on described by the waiter. The name is escaping me but the two I was deciding between were among a group of not-your-usual Italian wines. I couldn't even recognize any grapes! But the two I tasted were wonderful. Impressed by the attention to detail here and the variety. My sister had the navy blue Manhattan and it was STRONG. I sensed that the other cocktails that were ordered by our group were the same. Not cheap by any means but I'm always happy to pay for a great meal, and this one was totally worth it.

LaRina Pastificio & Vino,5401,387 Myrtle Ave,Brooklyn,11205.0,31202,"Hot and new spot, which you NEED to visit, especially if you're a pasta lover AND love variety because LaRina offers a 3 for $38 pasta option, where the chef selects 3 pasta dishes for you to eat. Think sushi omasake, but at super affordable prices as for $38, this easily feeds 2 without leaving you super stuffed. Portion wise, it's pretty generous as I would say the 3 pastas are equivalent to 1.5 of a real pasta plate serving. Definitely make a reservation as this place is small and packed as word has already gotten out. We had a reservation for 2 at 7 pm and still had to wait 10 minutes for a table - that's how popular this place is.The tasting pastas we were given were the smoked spaghetti, rosemary pappardelle, and the special of the day (I don't recall the name, but it was a pasta similar to rigatoni accompanied by a wild boar ragu. The fact that they chose 2 pastas from their regular menu and added the special for tasting was impressive to me - I hate when the tasting menu is nothing from the actual menu. Hands down, the smoked spaghetti was our favorite - surprising because I never order spaghetti. This spaghetti however, was truly unique as it was spicy and was paired so well with the hazelnuts. So much flavor for a dish without being drowned with toppings or meat! Seriously, I'm not doing this dish justice by describing it - you just have to go and try it. We both looked at each other after our first bite and immediately knew we'd be back - I would definitely order this again. The pappardelle was our second favorite as we enjoyed the ragu and pasta. You can tell the pasta was made in house. The pasta special was good as well, but when compared to the other two, it fell flat as the sauce was too tomatoey and I didn't really enjoy the pasta shape. All pastas were perfectly al dente though. While waiting, we smelled something SO good from the tables around us, which was the mushroom tagliatelle. Almost every table had one, so next time that's on my list! My only compliant with this place is that we weren't served a bread basket, which I so desperately wanted. Some tables had one though, so maybe you just have to ask? Besides the amazing food, service is great and the atmosphere is super cute and homey - there's a map which displays regions of cheeses and wines, which I loved. Really took me back to my visits to Italy.

The interior of the restaurant is great and very romantic if you're looking for a nice date spot.We ordered and shared the spaghetti aglio e oglio peperoncino and the ravioli di burrata. The ravioli was good but not great because of one issue both dishes shared...TOO MUCH SALT. First, let me say that I am a fan of salt and usually have the tendency to add salt to things. The ravioli had only slightly too much salt, the spaghetti had so much salt it was almost not edible. We ate it because we were so hungry but I think we both drank three gallons of water just to survive the ordeal. It's disappointing because I could tell there were some amazing flavors in the spaghetti but I could barely taste them because my mouth was overwhelmed by all the salt.Judging by all the positive reviews I'm going to guess that we came on an off night.

LaRina Pastificio & Vino,5401,387 Myrtle Ave,Brooklyn,11205.0,194484,"So let me start by saying I am a native Manhattanite, but have lived in Italy for many years. I KNOW good Italian food- especially good pasta. Most Americans don't, simply put. Principally because of the Italian-American restaurants that serve ""penne a la vodka"" and chicken parm- things that don't actually exist in Italy. So I can understand when some people send pasta back and say it's ""undercooke."" It's because they truly don't know what ""al dente"" is really supposed to taste like. Anyway good pasta is simple: it doesn't depend on the sauce, contrary to what most people think. Good pasta is good on its own, and coupled with high-quality, simple ingredients, it becomes a thing of splendor. This is what La Rina gives its patrons: pasta of pure SPLENDOR.  You cannot go wrong with any of the pastas, but the smoked spaghetti and rigatoni with seafood were especially exceptional. Burrata was excellent and I usually don't mess with American style burrata. The side dishes- like broccoli and potatoes were excellent too. Anyway I think we did the 5 course tasting and then added the cacio e pepe. Absolutely magnificent. This chef makes fresh pasta, not boxed processed pasta, so you can also buy some to take home with you.This chef is a lovely, hospitable woman who certainly has a strong culinary background but manages to deliver Michelin worthy pasta dishes in a very casual setting. You can tell that a lot of love and attention goes into every one of these dishes so ignore the haters who leave bad reviews. This place deserves five stars, and if it was in Manhattan you'd never get a table, hipsters, so please be quiet.

The funny folded menu is concise but it packs a punch.We went for 5 pastas to share for $ 60, The showstoppers were certainly the smoked spaghetti g&o w peperoncino, the tagliatelle in the saffron sauce, the shell pasta w smoked eggplant ,nduja n caprino, blk ink bucatini n anchovies. The pastas come out in small bowls to be shared and it worked perfectly for our party of 6.

Table service was excellent, however after spending nearly $200 on dinner for 3, we didn't expect to be rushed out upon receiving the check by the blond finger-pointing hostess who kept assuring the couple at the bar that we would soon be leaving.

Why must you disappoint me? :(Imagine my excitement when I realized that LaoMa had opened up a new location right across the counter from Chatime! My favorite food has finally moved to a place above ground where I can enjoy the food and have cell phone service. Sadly, however, I was disappointed in both aspects, but let's just focus on the food here.(If you're not sure what ma la tang is, read my review for their location in New World Mall here: yelp.com/biz/laoma-malat…)The meal started off great. I ordered, and they brought the food to the table I and my three friends were sitting at. I immediately started hunting for the bottle of black vinegar, only to find one on a nearby counter that was almost empty. I asked the cooks if we could get more, only for them to browse their shelves and tell me that they have run out. Luckily, only one other friend wanted the vinegar, so we were able to split the remains and proceed to enjoy our dinner.About 2/3 of the way through, I started noticing that the broth was becoming progressively saltier. At first I ignored it, thinking it would go away. I was so wrong: not only did it not go away, but it also got progressively worse to the point that I didn't even want to finish the rest of the vegetables in the pot because they, too, were afflicted with saltiness. (Thank goodness Chatime's right there so I can buy something to drink to offset it.) I thought I was the only one, but friend #2 also commented on the broth being too salty. Then I thought, ""Maybe it's the vinegar. Maybe it's actually soy sauce and not vinegar."" But friend #3, who hadn't added vinegar, also said her broth was too salty. Maybe we went on a bad day? *sad face*So, fail #1: not enough resources; fail #2: salty broth. (I'm not going to comment on the lack of cell phone service there.) I still enjoyed 2/3 of the meal, and I'm considering the possibility of it being an off-day for them, so I'm still giving them 3 stars.

Seriously this happened just today - the employee told me my total, then stopped talking to me to answer another customer's question. Then she started putting together that person's order!

You were the first modern coffee shop in my area, at first, you were so good to me--your baristas were trained, your sandwiches were decent, and your vibe was good, but there wasn't much competition, over time you have slowly slipped into complacency.Your sandwiches are tasty but small and no longer include a side salad. At $8.50 and up they feel a bit stiff for something that is just headed up by the barista. The cappuccino today was ok but not quite good and for the prices should be of a higher grade. You have the beans and the machine, but there is little passion. Maybe part of it is you're understaffed. I came in recently, and the cafe staff was missing. After a few minutes of waiting a woman emerged from the bathroom. By now four customers were waiting to put in orders, and one maybe gave up. Because there is only one employee they are forced to do the register, be the barista and handle the food. The young woman handled herself fine, but you could tell she was a bIt frazzled. The frazzling carried over to my order as she forgot to head my sandwich and 25 minutes later I had to go up and remind her. Lark, I am tempted to give a two-star review here, but I will hold off.

They understand grown adults need their caffeine. So much so that they offer a children's play area. How nice is that? I don't have kids but I can imagine families in the area appreciate that. Usually when I stop in for coffee I get it to go, but this past week I decided to chill and get some work done. In need of a sugary pick me up, I grabbed one of the strawberry poptart(esque) pastries they always have on rotation. These were flaky, light and just the right amount of sweetness.

I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere inside, which wasn't too ritzy but clean, with lots of tables and open space. I decided to get lunch, and ordered the toasted prosciutto sandwich and salad. Let me just say, the sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Tons of meat, greens, and pesto grilled to perfection. Prosciutto is one of my all-time favorite things, so I was in heaven. The side salad wasn't anything too fancy, just some mixed greens with a light dressing, but it complemented the sandwich very well. Together, the sandwich and salad were $8.75, which is a great price considering the ingredients and quality. I'm not much of a coffee connoisseur, so I got an iced flavoured latte, which was super sweet and delicious, though the almost $5 price tag was surprising. There's a bin to drop your dishes as you leave, though I could see it hadn't been bussed in quite a while and things were starting to pile up.

Lark Cafe,5403,1007 Church Ave,New York,11218.0,160070,"The point of Lark Cafe, from all that I have read about it, is that it's meant as a family-friendly eatery. Come with your rugrat, flop him down somewhere, and commune with other parents around java and pastries. Though the pastries are sort of interesting and the Americano isn't too burnt, the cafe itself is a mockery of its remit.The shop is divided by sliding door into two rooms; to the left is the play area, to the right is the eating area. There isn't a setup where you can eat while you watch your kids; you have to wall them away, for some reason. If you have a stroller, you can only enter through the play area; the other door has a large drop-off in front. Also, the floors in both sections are bare concrete. Even with the thin squares of rug, I cringed every time I saw a child fall. That's got to hurt. And it ought to be freezing. Where's the rubberized coating? For that matter, why does the play area open to the street? That's a disaster in the making.The atmosphere in both rooms is sterile: white, mirrors, clean lines, modernist stools.

Lark Cafe,5403,1007 Church Ave,New York,11218.0,44670,"I wish this place was better. The only reason I gave it two stars is because they have good coffee (Stumptown) and brew it well. Sandwiches are quite bad and the waitstaff seems really out of it.For starters, I ordered a large coffee, and the guy behind the counter gave me a small. I waited saying since I ordered a large, it must be for somebody else, but kept insisting what he gave me was a large; it was only when he put down another coffee in a larger cup right next to it (!) that he realized he actually gave me a small. Whatever, I thought, it's a Saturday morning and simple enough mistake.I got the smoked salmon sandwich, which would have been overpriced (for what it was) at $6.50, but cost $9.50. If your coffee shop sandwich is around that price point, it should definitely not suck. The bread was good and the salmon okay, but everything else was not so good. This thing had three paper-thin wisps of mandolined red onion, four capers, and no mascarpone like it was supposed to, and just seemed carelessly thrown together. Since it was almost ten bucks, I wanted to make sure I at least got the mascarpone, as the sandwich was completely dry. When I brought it up and asked if it was supposed to have mascarpone on it, the dazed guy behind the counter just said, ""You wanted it cold."" I said, ""No, sorry, what I mean is that I think there's supposed to be mascarpone cheese on this, and there's not."" He responded with, ""Mascarpone isn't a cheese, it's a spread,"" at which point I cut my losses and gave up.Looking back at other reviews, it seems like service has always been not great, and doesn't really look like it's changing.

The cafe part is so cute and definitely needs a more cozy feel especially with the wooden benches. The playroom definitely doesn't give off a fun play vibe for kids. White walls, some random animal heads. I think it should be added with some color and just really pitch to the little ones visuals. Now the last couple of days I've gone it has been relatively clean in the playroom unlike others days that it irked me to see my kid on the floor. I saw one of the nannies actually sweep and clean up the playroom. That's not her job your employees should be cleaning up after the sing alongs. I agree with some other post your staff seems under the influence of something because they are some serious space cadets. They forget your order or take forever to make it OR even worse stare at you like they haven't a clue of what you just said. I find them very unprofessional when their friends are lingering around and they pay more attention to them while customers are waiting.

So Lark did the obvious: find the places that make great coffee, pastries, doughnuts, cookies, and bagels... and then sell them in your shop.All of the food and drink I've had here has been fantastic. The espresso and coffee are great, the doughnuts from Dough are delicious, and the mustard + cheddar scones from Ovenly are so good.The service is great. Baristas and cashiers are friendly and helpful.They have free wifi, although the signal is pretty weak, as another commenter noted.The atmosphere is the only drawback, and it's a small one. There are times when the children can be a bit overwhelming. While there is a designated area for kids, they can sometimes overflow into the rest of the shop.

I sit down on the floor with him and sit my coffee while playing with him and the cool toys. Instead of me trying to hold a six month old bucking bronco in my lap, he can play and I can have a coffee and socialize a bit. He is just starting to show an interest in looking at other kids and smiling at them, so this is great! Plus I meet other moms and that's a nice way to connect with other neighbors and learn more about the upcoming stages of infancy for my son/motherhood for me. There are so many nice events planned, which I haven't made it to yet,  but in the end it has really been a great place to hang out on a hot or rainy day.If I can allow a complaint, the air conditioning in the play area was blasting and it was freezing in there.

Lark Cafe,5403,1007 Church Ave,New York,11218.0,127658,"Today was my first visit to Lark, and I am more than excited that there is finally a decent little coffee shop/cafe in the neighborhood.I went on a busy Saturday morning, and there was something happening in the room they have to the side. So, this is clearly a VERY family friendly place as there were strollers parked out front and the noises coming from the kids room sounded like a maternity ward on steroids. For those of us eating in the actual seating part, a little music would have been helpful to drown out the noise of the children, instead of them waiting to put on music after whatever was going on in the playroom ended. If you don't like kids or the noise that accompanies them, check their  schedule first. After play session was over, it was nice, quiet, and relaxing inside.The interior has a very clean aesthetic and is nicely decorated with white walls, wood accents and pops of yellow, which is a nice change from the lack of anything like this in the neighborhood. The coffee was good, and the prices on all the food are reasonable. I had the banana and Nutella on toast for breakfast, and it was good, nothing to rave about, but certainly perfect for sitting and enjoying the paper and a cup of coffee with. I am certainly looking forward to coming back and trying the assortment of lunch sandwiches they have available.As comes with any cafe that offers free WiFi, there were quite a few people lingering and taking up tables on this busy Saturday morning. But, it is NYC, and this is to be expected. That Community room must bring in a lot of breakfast, because it sure would be nice to have some more seating in that space.My only disappointment was the full bin of dirty dishes that was sitting next to my seat, for an entire hour.

Hypothetically, if such a thing were to occur, it would happen at Lark Cafe. The coffee is pretty good - I used to come a lot in the fall/winter and drink my fill of cappuccinos, which had a great milk-to-espresso ratio. I'm not a huge fan of their iced drinks since they put the ice in AFTER the liquids, which tends to make the whole thing taste kind of room temperature instead of cold and refreshing. I like the turkey sandwiches! Also, the baristas are super friendly - to the point where I'd want to climb over the glass case and hang out with them instead of doing whatever I came to Lark to do in the first place.My only complaint is that the decor/furniture are a little cold -- literally and metaphorically. Like, I'd go on a super hot day in July and have to leave after an hour because that place is COLD. The seats are generally uncomfortable, but that's good if you need to get work done.

The time was 3:30 on a Saturday. There was only 1 guy working. Lots of dirty dishes piled in the corner and no paper towels in the bathroom. The cappuccino was luke warm :(  We only got a pop tart, and a coolhause ice cream cookie. Wife got a latte. The plate was a little dirty with finger marks. Cost was $19 and change. Mmmmm ok I guess that's standard? Fancy coffee and treats cost the amount of a dinner these days. Its an epidemic everywhere. Even in Flatbush...sighThey offer classes which is cool but we weren't going for that. We wanted food! I hope they can be more in stock with their goods. I have a gut feeling everything is bought in and nothing is freshly made by staff. Granted everything they serve is made by amazing vendors weather its coffee, pies, ice cream sandwiches, pastries etc. But I think they need to get more help to make sure everything is tidy. I kinda felt like we went after a tornado hit the place and was slightly disappointed but the guy up front was really nice and was working hard but just not enough support.I'd also suggest slapping on some new coat of paint or cleaning the walls.

As my co-workers and I chatted and ate to our contentment, we would also watch the latest soccer match that was blaring 24/7 on the TV. I don't know if they make empanadas anymore since I last came here, but they make everything else. They make 'em good. When I crave hot chocolate that's not in a packet, I come here.

Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,53839,"Okay, it's a new restaurant, so I will cut them a little bit of slack.Let's start with the good - the food was delicious.  My buddy and I split the Campechano, which was a pretty sizeable plate of three kinds of meat (we chose beef, chicken and pork), rice, and guac, and ""10"" tortillas on the side (will get to this in a minute).  The quality of the meat was excellent, and the meal was surprisingly very filling.  I do wish that there were more vegetables - the plate was probably 75% meat, with about 3 or 4 stray string beans lazily buried beneath the rice.  Would it kill them to throw a spoonful of black beans onto the plate?Sorry, I may have jumped the gun a bit with the bad.  So my friend and I ordered the guacamole appetizer to start, and I swear, I could count the number of chips they gave us.  Jesus guys, can you spare 'em?  And ease up on the lime on the guacamole.  It tasted like someone dipped an avocado into a Bud Light Lime.The second thing that peeved me was the number of tortillas with the Campechano plate.  Now bear with me here, because I'm going somewhere with this.  The waitress made a big show of the fact that there would be 10 tortillas on the plate.  My friend and I asked her three times if the Campechano would be filling enough for two people.  She said ""definitely, it comes with TEN tortillas, so I think you guys will be fine.""  Well wouldn't you think that when she brings the basket of tortillas, we only counted 8 in the stack?  Guess the busboy got a little hungry on the walk to the table, huh?Speaking of the service, I literally had to swat the busboys away from my plates several times as I was finishing my meal.  It was almost as if the building was on fire, and if my table didn't evacuate the restaurant that minute, the place would burn to the ground.  GUYS -  CHILL.  I'm eating my meal slowly, trying to enjoy it with my friends.  No need to ask me four times if I'm done.  Ask me once, and when I say no, take that as a polite indication to move away from my table and let me finish my meal in peace.  Jesus Christ.The last thing that really got on my nerves was when it came time to pay the bill.  I guess this restaurant uses an automated iPad for this sort of thing.  So my friend gave our waitress his credit card, and she swiped it right away.  In theory, this is an amazing system.  No need to wait 10 minutes to get your card back or anything like that.  But here's the caveat.  After the waitress swipes your card, she hands you back the iPad so you can indicate how much you want to tip her while she hovers over your shoulder.  Aside from the fact that this is unbelievably awkward, it also borders on unprofessional.  I don't mean the waitress- she was fine- I mostly mean the system itself.  There has got to be a better way to do this so that customers can decide on an appropriate tip amount without feeling pressured or rushed or like their privacy has been impeded.  Just a few candid thoughts from Richie.  It was a fine meal which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1.  But if they really want to take this place to the next level, they have some work to do.",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",4,0,0.0,14.8999996185,"friend,restaurant,Campechano,meat,bit,number,food,plate,meal,slack.,plate,system,tortillas,meal,guac,quality,rice,buddy,side,pork,chicken,beef,kinds,card,waitress,meal,fact,plate,tortillas,string beans,rice,bit,black beans,guys,plate,plate,bad,gun,spoonful,guacamole appetizer,busboy,tortillas,tortillas,tortillas,waitress,plates,times,guys,guacamole,table,friends,times,thing,number,lime,restaurant,table,fact,customers,building,busboys,place,need,waitress,chips,avocado,someone,somewhere,show,people,stack,walk,credit card,service,fire,ground,basket,Jesus Christ.,need,iPad,Bud Light Lime.,anything,caveat,shoulder,vegetables,place,way,GUYS - CHILL,Campechano,system,tip amount,privacy,thoughts,stars,level,work,table,thing,restaurant,indication,peace,bill,nerves,sort,theory,Richie","1,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,6,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,6,4,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,2,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,2,5,1,7,4,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,5,7,7,7,1","0.13288487494,0.127244636416,0.0545533746481,0.0504784658551,0.0346757024527,0.0310655906796,0.0299919806421,0.0293764080852,0.0251778140664,0.0251454636455,0.0192662905902,0.0180548503995,0.0171955265105,0.0170285608619,0.0150517625734,0.014232837595,0.0136942174286,0.0119854612276,0.0119854612276,0.0119854612276,0.0119854612276,0.0119854612276,0.0119854612276,0.0112030683085,0.0111641362309,0.00781053584069,0.00728972861543,0.00683789746836,0.00532130058855,0.00518748071045,0.00518748071045,0.0051728351973,0.0051728351973,0.0046460730955,0.00458278832957,0.0045711491257,0.00452599395066,0.00452599395066,0.00452599395066,0.00451554870233,0.0044375914149,0.00435583340004,0.00433558132499,0.00433151144534,0.00430419435725,0.00416668877006,0.0040869214572,0.0038232030347,0.00381673756056,0.0037864476908,0.0037207629066,0.00371821387671,0.00371366925538,0.00348417460918,0.00347149162553,0.00346211274154,0.00346211274154,0.00345750595443,0.00342522119172,0.00329002528451,0.00315149337985,0.00314891594462,0.00314206304029,0.00309838214889,0.00304830935784,0.00303267966956,0.00303267966956,0.00302863144316,0.00302497413941,0.00302163907327,0.00301573937759,0.00301310280338,0.00287865963764,0.00275721331127,0.00275495811366,0.00275495811366,0.00259010586888,0.0024424912408,0.00233913166448,0.00217505148612,0.002051967429,0.00204642605968,0.00204540835693,0.00204442976974,0.00196585361846,0.00187887938228,0.0017313726712,0.00162947562058,0.00161651009694,0.0016162720276,0.00141337653622,0.00141337653622,0.00141278875526,0.00141221995,0.00141166883986,0.00141166883986,0.00113097741269,0.00112961092964,0.00103363092057,0.000899847073015,0.000899847073015,0.000899290258531,0.000899290258531,0.000898759695701,0.000897768244613,0.000836134480778"

However, the bottom line for me is food - it's not great. We tried the fajitas and the huitlacoche quesadilla and both were below par- for the neighborhood and Mexican food in general. The huitlacoche wasn't even huitlacoche (which is a fungus and has a very distinct taste, different from regular mushrooms). What i received was just bland button mushrooms. And both dishes were really boring and under seasoned. Even the rice and beans on the side were awful. It's tough to F up Mexican food - it's either high end or fun and greasy, you can't go wrong. So I'm surprised that this place is so strangely in the middle and the food is a miss. It's not bad food, but it is far from good. The margaritas were poorly made and tasted like bottled sour mix and both (we tried two types) were too sweet.

Even when we asked for more chips were told us it would be $2 extra (which by the way, was also ridiculous, who charges extra for more chips?)...then when the food finally did come all the tacos came out on communal plates so it was impossible to sort out which was which, and they charged us for an extra taco. I get it, things happen and maybe their supplier messed up on the avocados, but they should offer a reasonable way of making up for it and try extra hard to appease customers if something like this happens, rather than asking people to pay full price for a lesser experience.

The chicharron app was AMAZING! It was a pickled chicharron slaw served on top of ONE HUGE crispy fried chicharron! It took us a while to figure out what it was and once we did we were impressed! I'd never had chicharron pickled like in the slaw before. It was a strange soft, chewy texture but once I got over the strangeness the slaw was an amazing tart and textural counterpoint to the rich, crispy chicharron underneath! Wow!The guacamole was great! The ceviche was tasty, but I think I would've enjoyed it more chopped up in a smaller dice like a salsa. But that could be my personal preference. The pork carnitas taco was AMAZING! So perfectly juicy and fatty and countered perfectly with the acid and toppings! I wish I'd had room for more but I got full from the apps. My husband really enjoyed his taco al pastor as well. Next time I'll be back for just a crap load of tacos, I want to try more!It's too bad they don't have a liquor license yet. I hope they'll get the go ahead to allow BYOB in the meantime.

The food tasted like it was sitting out for a while which means, it was probably waited to get bused to our table. Food was bland and no where near Mexican tasting. The meats were dry and flavorless.

Our entrees took a bit too get to us (nothing too outrages) my partners meal was good, but my tacos were cold and lacked flavor. The Al Pastor was the biggest let down as it was almost ice cold, and it had a tiny sliver of pineapple on it. I also thought it was odd that I had to pay 2 dollars extra for a tiny side of sour cream (anything is possible in Queens I guess). We had run out of water and never got out little jug refilled.

Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,30717,"Three.four stars.I gave them a forced four star review basically for their sangria because I love me my sangria. I had noticed that they just received their liquor license so I decided to wait a week or two after that.So after seeing them open during Cinco de Mayo weekend, I found out it was a ""soft open"" without a liquor license. I was skeptical about this location. Years ago it as a crepes place and then the short lived PS (Postscriptum) Pizza. Additionally, between the main train stops (30th avenue and 36th avenue) we have a plethora of Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants. So what is going to make Las Catrinas different from the other locations?Well, finally tried the place. First off, if you're familiar with the previous place that it's not a big location. Bar tables by the window and tightly packed tables inside and that same bar by the wall is there as well. It was semi-full around eight pm and we decided to sit by the window facing out. Once seated we waited a good fifteen minutes before anyone came up to us to ask us what we'd like to drink, eat or even offer us water. In fact, there was a couple who came in after that ended up getting served on prior, receiving drinks and food before us.I had their La Mujer Dormida Sangria (red) and it was absolutely delicious. With an assortment of fruits such as blackberries, green apple, blue berries and strawberries it was sweet as can be and that's my kind of sangria. I also had the La Riviera Maya Sangria (white) and that tasted quite different with its orange fruits.. It sort of had a tangy taste to it. Their Watermelon Agua Fresca (vodka-based) wasn't too bad either, not too sweet but there was some light juice flavor in there.We both had their steak quesadilla and sadly I wasn't too impressed. Although there was a good flavor to the steak, the tortilla imo was dry. I barely tasted any of the guac that they topped it off with. Oddly, one of the quesadillas had way more steak in it as well. I know that they just opened, but the service was subpar. When our waitress finally come over to take our order she looked like a deer lost in headlights. She came back once to ask how everything was which was nice but man, they needed at least another server there checking in on things.Additionally, you're kind of forced to give 20% 25% 30% tip regardless of how bad service may be. I'm not into to that.Tacos were also priced kind of high, we're close to Manhattan but come on man. There are dozens of other spots in the area that serve great tacos for less and sometimes even half the price.I'd definitely come back for their sangria and try their other drinks. I'd come back to try their tacos as well at some point. But if you just want to eat tacos or Mexican, like I previously mentioned there are dozens of options. It's not to say I dislike Las Catrinas, but I just wasn't too impressed with my quesadilla (and I've had them from all over New York).",3.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",3,0,0.0,12.0,"sangria,open,sangria,place,star review,location,liquor license,liquor license,La Riviera Maya Sangria,fact,Postscriptum,couple,spots,any,us.,dozens,that.So,Cinco de Mayo,one,place,locations,Mexican,place,avenue,avenue,sangria,train stops,restaurants,plethora,Bar tables,location,juice flavor,drinks,tables,window,bar,window,steak quesadilla,steak,water,fruits,flavor,anyone,tortilla imo,everything,tacos,service,fruits,Las Catrinas,wall,food,strawberries,kind,berries,apple,assortment,blackberries,tacos,taste,La Mujer Dormida Sangria,drinks,PS,Tex-Mex,man,guac,things.,price.,area,Watermelon Agua Fresca,tacos,quesadilla,Tacos,dozens,tip,point,options,service,Manhattan,waitress,steak,quesadillas,order,man,server,headlights,deer,New York","7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,4,1,7,2,2,7,2,2,7,4,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,3,3,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2","0.222572445869,0.106793403625,0.0608849897981,0.0449207685888,0.0389657281339,0.0232216026634,0.0217807497829,0.0212376024574,0.0200929008424,0.0190897621214,0.0158524475992,0.0157931093127,0.0132743678987,0.0123511385173,0.0119567429647,0.0114010525867,0.0110193453729,0.0110193453729,0.00910870078951,0.008849542588,0.00880422070622,0.00872623641044,0.00847600679845,0.00802701245993,0.00802701245993,0.00708581972867,0.00702358409762,0.00702358409762,0.00702358409762,0.00659848935902,0.00593326007947,0.00584061956033,0.0055036121048,0.00538756791502,0.00538756791502,0.00538756791502,0.00537953199819,0.00537741230801,0.00537301599979,0.00537235336378,0.00535995420069,0.00520678237081,0.0052020275034,0.00510600628331,0.00507589941844,0.00494162086397,0.00489994604141,0.00489993579686,0.00474245334044,0.00471373088658,0.00469474261627,0.00468956725672,0.00468956725672,0.00468956725672,0.00468956725672,0.00468956725672,0.00468956725672,0.00452449498698,0.00428300304338,0.00420033326373,0.00417819665745,0.00417060824111,0.0041588274762,0.00363638089038,0.00356883136556,0.00318328710273,0.00317961722612,0.00317961722612,0.00302531872876,0.00297447037883,0.00276212068275,0.00254739262164,0.00235898979008,0.00226035714149,0.00220001512207,0.00219887634739,0.00209797569551,0.00188311142847,0.00186992133968,0.00175784912426,0.00175784912426,0.00162640691269,0.0015956191346,0.00148771284148,0.00139676372055,0.00139676372055,0.0013007724192"
Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,50760,"Soft opening so no booze for now! But still very friendly staff. They use tablets to take your order and accept payments so it's nice and fast when you're ready to pay. Menu is simple--strong selection of appetizers and entrees, plus a taco selection, and a few salads, quesadillas and cemitas (sandwiches). Specials vary and were listed on the drink menu (for now consisting of craft mocktails, Jarritos, and soda). We got something to share (the Nopal one with homemade chorizo) with tortilla chips (amazing--perfectly seasoned), and then each got an entree. The app comes with a blanket of queso over chorizo and the queso was extremely hard to separate but worth the effort. I got the shrimp and subbed Mexican rice for some extra flavor. The diabla sauce was great--it had a nice kick that complemented the flavors. They give a decent amount of shrimp for the price (~$16). Recommend trying. The other entrees we got were fajitas with beef and the pork cemita. The cemita comes covered in queso and it's amazing looking. The fajitas are standard, comes with corn tortillas (packed up in a little basket and wrapped in a nice cloth), beans and rice. The corn tortillas were pretty on point. The service was good--our food was taking a while and the waiter came over to apologize, which was thoughtful of him. The host is very friendly, too, and was apologetic about not being able to serve alcohol/allow BYOB (they changed the policy to be on the safe side). The overall vibe was nice, place was clean and quiet enough that you can have a conversation at a comfortable volume.

She then took our order. I ordered 3 steak tacos and my cousin ordered a steak quesadilla. What I got back was a joke. They were 3 mini tacos...not the size of the tortillas that they sell in stores and they were way overpriced. They didn't come with anything else (no rice with beans, that's also extra). In my honest opinion, they werent good. It tasted so plain, no flavor to the meat. My cousins quesadilla looked decent. She said it was okay, nothing to rave about.

Ordered:Husband had the spicy habanero margarita, a steak taco and two of their spicy pork tacos. I had the al pastor tacos and a watermelon cocktail (I can't recall the name).Pros:1) Service was friendly, we were seated and served promptly. I also enjoy their use of tablets to input orders and check you out (the waiter doesn't have to walk away with your card). 2) The cocktails were enjoyable. My husband said his drink was really spicy which he enjoys. 3) Atmosphere was enjoyable with the open air feel3) Prices seemed fair, $3 or so per taco, and I think each cocktail was around $11 (not sure if they have any happy hour deals).Cons:1) Food....was just not good. I didn't know that tacos with meat made on a spic where all the fat should flavor the meat could be dry and tasteless. (Note, I compare all pork tacos to those at Chelsea Market, and these were no where near the deliciousness). Happy there was salsa.  2) When handed the tablet to check out, my options for tip were 20%, 25%, 30% or other.

To be fair it was somewhat full inside at 6:00pm and I think everything can be easily fixed. Both our appetizer and entrees came out before our drinks did. When the food runner dropped off our guacamole all we could do was stare at it because we were given no utensils, no napkins, side plates or hot sauce. It wasn't long before we flagged someone down to give it to us. When our drinks were finally dropped the salt was forgotten on my margarita so I told the drink runner i had asked for salt.

From the tortillas, made on site, to the chips and guacamole, the carnitas, chicken, rice, beans! All the food is cooked to high standards. Kudos to the kitchen staff for an amazing job!! This place received 1 star because the table service and bar(drinks) were so deplorable. Upon arriving a waitress asked my husband and I how many we were, we said 2, she told us to wait one second and she never came back. Twenty minutes later we were seated by another gentleman who got us seats immediately (we had noticed 20 minutes prior there were several tables for 2 open). It took ANOTHER 23 minutes to finally meet our waitress and get a menu. The waitress was nice but VERY distracted, having long conversations with all her tables. After 15 minutes we signaled the gentleman who sat us because the waitress never came back to take our orders, he took them and we waited again. After watching the bartender making a pink margaritas ( which was awful), we watched our drinks sit at the bar for another 12 minutes after which I decided I would get up and get it myself. The gentleman must have noticed because he then brought it to us. The rest of the evening went the same way, a very distracted waitress and extremely slow turn around. We were sitting in front of the kitchen so we were able to see that our meals were sitting there for us and our waitress was too busy giggling and conversing with other patrons. It took the couple next to us 20 minutes to close out their bill. When we asked another waitress there for assistance she simply replied "" these aren't my tables"". Who does this!?

My bf & I arrived late on a Saturday night after scrupulously examining the yelp reviews for nearby Mexican spots. I have seen a lot of social media hype over this spot & had been meaning to check it out with my bf who doesn't know much about the Queens foodie scene. First of all, it was like 60° outside and it was at least 80 inside. Now I would much rather be a little bit warm than too cold when I'm eating but it was so fucking hot in this place I just wanted to take a nap. I don't know if this is like a one-time glitch and they just had an issue but it was uncomfortably hot.We order drinks, I was intrigued by the dios mio margarita, bf had the apple pie mule. I love a spicy marg & this one was on the money. All of the flavors married well to add just enough of a kick but careful not overpower the basic margarita flavor. I guess my bf liked his drink we both ordered another round. In my second round my drink appeared to be the same aesthetically but tasted totally different. It had much more of a smoke flavor than spice, not into inconsistency. I got the mussels & they came with 3 pieces of garlic toast that lined the bowl of soupy mussels so they were soupy too! They should def rethink that. Mussels were spicy af which I wasn't really feeling. The spice was overpowering. The guacamole was well done & we both loved the chips. Def 4 star guac & chips.I had 2 tacos: the al pastor & the fish. The al pastor was tasty but the fish had this glob of spicy mayo that robbed the flavor of the fish. This spicy mayo was so pungent that it could've been on anything & still been the main flavor. Not into that. It also seeped down my hand with every bite, not cute. The ambiance was really cute despite feeling like I was in a bikram yoga class. There were only two overhead lighting fixtures, the rest of the light was from candles. They also had great art work. So super cute for a date. They did well with the limited space. Overall, not impressed.

We arrived with a 6 pack of Corona - nothing crazy - and were told that we couldn't bring it in and that their lawyer advised they shouldn't market byob so they could get their liquor license quicker. Fine. We proceeded and ordered accordingly. The food was not good or as expected (quesadilla did NOT look like a traditional quesadilla). Fajitas we're not served with all the typical accoutrements. We gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and figured they needed to sort out a few kinks.4 months later today, I tired to give this place another shot. I live in the area so I felt they deserved it. Nope. They ran out of guacamole. This restaurant is next to a 24 hour organic produce market! There is no reason to run out of guac. I asked for at least chips and salsa instead. We were given pico and their house sauces. The pico and chips were later on the check which really upset me. We paid regardless and didn't make a fuss because honestly the way to pay is extremely awkward. Server gives you an iPad and stands there while you decide what to tip.Chicken quesadilla was very bland with no flavor. Elotes appetizer was ok. Corn should be grilled not boiled. Fish tacos were ok, al pastor was dry. The drinks were tasty but overpriced for the area.

But besides the decor the food is definitely worth itStarted with the guac and elote. BIG BIG BIG fan of elote it was really good and the portion was huge. I really just wished the guac was salter though it felt a little under seasoned but besides that it was great.We split 4 tacos. I fell in love with the al pastor the grilled pineapple gave it the extra flavor kick. The white fish taco with chipotle mayo was also amazing it was juicy and the fish wasn't dry.Two side notes: try the drinks they are super good.the hot sauces aren't that spicy but they cute in their little beer bottles.IF YOU DO LIKE SPICY... THEY HAVE A SHRIMP DISH called something diabalo it was really good. If you like spicy wow it had a great kick.

I was in love with all the decor from the moment I stepped in. It was a hot day, and the entire restaurant was open but the inside still felt cool. I got a mango margarita while my friend got the classic margarita. Both were really strong!! To start we got guac and chips and ceviche. The guac : chips ratio was off, the plate was surrounded by chips with a medium sized circle of guac in the middle. I wish they took more time to mush the guac more, because there were some hefty chunks of avocado in there. Nonetheless, it was still really good. The ceviche had nice chunks of fish, the perfect amount of tanginess and the cucumber really tied it all together. We ordered 8 tacos amongst the 2 of us: 2 al pastor, 2 carnitas, 2 chicken and 2 fish. All of them were stuffed to the max so it was very messy; not a bad thing though! My favorite was definitely the al pastor, I loved the sweetness of the pineapple paired with the meat. The meat was on the dryer side, but their homemade sauces fixed that. Bottled in Corona bottles, our waitress explained they were all homemade and the different spice levels.

Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,19205,"I came here last night with my girlfriend. Located in the heart of Astoria, Queens (32nd st & Broadway) this cozy little spot for Mexican cuisine certainly has potential to go far.It's important to note they've just opened up, and are in the process of getting their liquor license so although they're not serving drinks for the meantime you're more than welcome to bring in your own 6-pack or bottle of wine etc. to pair with your meal. I gladly walked to the deli located directly across the street, and purchased two 22oz cans of Modelo for me & my girlfriend it seemed right for the occasion.The place was packed, but luckily we got seated right away. The interior was beautifully designed. There is a nice bar area off to the side as well as another bar overlooking the kitchen where you can sit,eat, and watch the cooks do their thing. Kind of like how you'd see in a sushi bar. The staff was perfect. Our waitress had a smile on the entire time we were there. It was a very warm embrace you don't usually get often. Ok now to the food. I think my favorite dish so far in this place would have to be the Guacamole. How many of you are in love with the Guac like I am? Then you know this is important when you walk into a Mexican joint. It was so fresh and well portioned with corn chips to dip included of course. We even had left over to scoop on our tacos. At 11$ it was well worth it. So after the Chips & Guac I also ordered 4 tacos. Reasonably priced on the menu (along with other selections) at 3-4$ a pop their well worth the price in weight. I ordered the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Chicken, and the Cecina? All were fine especially paired with their 3 hot sauces they provide (Mild,Medium,Chipotle Hot) which were very good. I'd personally go with the Medium it's got the right kick if you're into hot sauce on everything like I am. The Al Pastor was definitely my favorite of the bunch the pulled pork was packed with flavor that's certainly their gem. Although I personally find the BYOB part for the meantime wallet satisfying I am interested to see what this place has up its sleeve as far as cocktail menu, and happy hour specials. I'll definitely have to return soon once they acquire that.I wish the owner the best of luck with the place  Astoria can be a tough neighborhood for new business's as I'm sure all you locals see new spots open, and close all the time. The way the place was filled wall to wall? It's got that neighborhood staple feel.

(Jarritos are disgusting) Customers need sweet drinks to alleviate some of the strong spice in your foods!That being said, the food was very tasty! The service was perfect! My friend and I ordered the ceviche as an appetizer, and we shared a ""Arabe"" sandwich.The server was sweet, attentive, passive, and prompt- perfect! Everything a server should be!The restaurant was quaint, beautiful, and clean. The only tiny thing I would change is take the plant off the table when customers sit down.NOW FOR THE FOOD--Ceviche- phenomenal. On par with some of the best Peruvian ceviches I've ever tasted. Strong fresh lemon taste, a wealth of fresh white fish hidden underneath the crisp green and red peppers. Thankfully my partner didn't like vegetables, so I had more to myself :-)Celima ""Arabe"" (sandwich)- pretty good, all the ingredients (cheese, pork, bread, yum) were fresh, but could use a bit more condiments (vinegar? And salt? I think) for more of that bite I am used to for the roasted pork.The part where I almost died- Because the sandwich needed a little more flavor, I tried the hot sauces. The red one was spicy, as expected. The green one was actually a bit sweet, surprisingly (good). Then I tried the brownish one with tomatoes and onions. That was very spicy! Ouch.. so I went to take a bite of the aforementioned sandwich to help qualm the  heat... cheese, bread, pork, no risk there. When I did, I tasted something sweet- then a huge wave of heat spread from my mouth to my face and then to my stomach. (Jalapeño?) I didn't expect this as I didn't see any spicy ingredients on the menu. Now by this point, I could barely breathe, being that my only options for drinks were jarritos (no) and water. I got up to go next door for something sweet to eat, all of a sudden my legs went cold and numb.. yes, I suffered a severe anxiety attack (first ever) from the spice in your food! A little warning would be nice! No joke, I literally almost passed out! I'm no expert in the spice realm, I've only delved Into it for about two years now, but I've NEVER had a reaction like this.

Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,75747,"The 3 stars are for the ceviche, guac, & margs. The ceviche was good and I would order it again if I were to go back (which I won't). The guacamole was VERY spicy, at times uncomfortably so but we liked it. The margaritas were also decent. We tried blood orange & tamarind. The chicken cemita was terrible. Overly fried chicken with no flavor on a role with things that sound great (cheese, smoked or dried? chipotle peppers, avocado, & onion). For some reason it just didn't work. The bread to ingredients ratio was too much, the cheese although delicious alone, just didnt add anything special to the sandwich, and the spicy chipotle taste was in EVERYTHING. There was also a stem from the dried pepper on the sandwich. All the food tasted the same, like they make some chipotle hot sauce and put it in every dish and it was hard to taste any flavor but that. Spicy doesn't equal flavorful. The feeling when something is so spicy that you can't taste much else.Tacos:Al pastor: Did not taste one pineapple. Literally, I looked.

Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,19200,"May the fourth be with you....my boyfriend & I ventured here last night for a pre Cinco De Mayo turn up Taco Night figuring we wouldn't be able to get through the doors today. Looking through the big, bay windows we saw that it was already packed but came in anyway..and were seated immediately. Our waitress who I have to say was extremely pleasant, always had a smile from ear to ear had informed us that they did not have a liquor license right now but we were free to bring our own drinks in (sweet!)..and that the quesadillas on the menu were not available at this time.. (bummer). She did offer us a watermelon fruit juice but we kindly declined and had water instead while my boyfriend went to the corner store to get Modelos to pair with our tacos we were about to order. The decor of this place gets a solid 5 stars...although it is a small place...there was room for a small bar across from where we were sitting with a few stools anddddd the highlight is you can see the chefs in the back prepping and cooking the food. There is even room to sit at another bar to watch them cook...super cool. The 3 homemade sauces that were placed on our tables were neat as well and come in Corona bottles in what looks like a 4 pack of beer. A small cactus is at every table in the middle which I found to be super cute and simple. I can honestly rave about the decor here all day because it was simple but very impressive. Food....for starters we ordered the Guacamole with warm tortilla chips. The guacamole was presented beautifully with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and a corn chip in the middle....AND it tasted even better than it looked. It was a decent portion for 2 people to kick off the night...for only $11. I ordered 4 tacos which were; Carne Asada, Pollo, Birria & Cecina which was suggested by our waitress to order. Maybe my review of these tacos isn't so great because I had really high expectations after trying the guac and being so in love with the decor and ambiance of this place as well. The Pollo & Carne Asada tacos were good...although the Carne Asada (steak) had little to no flavor but with the help of some green picante sauce & guacamole it was amazing. The Cecina & Birria tacos...I couldn't tell the difference between either one but both were beef...I was not impressed with the texture of the meat nor the flavoring. I was able to finish one by loading up on the green sauce but the other I left on my plate because it was way too chewy for my liking.However...the tacos were very decently priced as well as the other items on the menu.  I would like to give this place another shot and maybe try some other dishes off the menu. The staff is super sweet and friendly, decor is perfect and the whole idea of BYOB is great so I will be returning again...especially for the guac.",4.0 star rating,"East Elmhurst, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,10.8999996185,"boyfriend,waitress,decor,fourth,doors,room,Cinco De Mayo,portion,guacamole,bay windows,decor,Taco Night,table,other,tacos,menu,ear,ear,water,tacos,smile,bummer,liquor license,watermelon fruit juice,chefs,sauces,place,Guacamole,drinks,highlight,cactus,people,food,stars,bar,bar,tables,middle,Food,starters,tortilla chips,middle,corn chip,corner store,stools,back,bottles,pack,beer,guacamole,tacos,onions,tomatoes,picante sauce,green sauce,dishes,decor,flavoring,tacos,Birria,Cecina,help,meat,texture,beef,plate,guac,place,quesadillas,Modelos,Corona,menu,menu,staff,idea,difference,tacos,liking.,items,guac,place,review,flavor,shot,ambiance,love,expectations,steak,both,Carne Asada,BYOB,Pollo,tacos","1,1,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,1,7,1,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7","0.212443709373,0.134198069572,0.0684764683247,0.046788200736,0.0382757559419,0.0294264405966,0.0227403398603,0.0223921630532,0.022386489436,0.018269514665,0.0176179558039,0.0149944350123,0.0134831219912,0.0119908619672,0.0102659529075,0.00873084366322,0.00794191751629,0.00794191751629,0.00791303720325,0.00738077796996,0.00694930413738,0.00694930413738,0.00694930413738,0.0069240280427,0.00656336219981,0.00643906462938,0.00630450062454,0.00607301667333,0.00596927665174,0.00570956990123,0.00567566975951,0.00557549111545,0.0053280564025,0.0053280564025,0.0053280564025,0.00531576108187,0.00530538754538,0.00529641797766,0.00483313575387,0.00483313575387,0.00483313575387,0.0048273014836,0.0048273014836,0.00467494502664,0.00466174259782,0.00466174259782,0.00464190542698,0.00464190542698,0.00464190542698,0.00451436499134,0.00448102829978,0.00422354275361,0.00422354275361,0.00394970597699,0.00394344469532,0.00360498088412,0.00359446159564,0.0035894701723,0.003431111807,0.0033411225304,0.0033411225304,0.00314297503792,0.00314040435478,0.00314040435478,0.00314040435478,0.00313799129799,0.00311629171483,0.00305037130602,0.00301072513685,0.00276768580079,0.00274811615236,0.00273022986948,0.00272825174034,0.0026573734358,0.0026573734358,0.002229958307,0.00217900052667,0.00217243866064,0.00217243866064,0.00198180228472,0.00186616601422,0.00168988131918,0.00157547520939,0.00154138996731,0.00137949059717,0.00137949059717,0.00137949059717,0.00137828383595,0.00135979766492,0.00130851485301,0.00128398858942,0.00105358310975,0.000942551589105"
Las Catrinas Mexican Bar & Eatery,5408,32-02 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,187814,"We are from the neighborhood and decided to try this restaurant for the first time last night.  I guess they just recently received their liquor license after taking over the space on Broadway that was a lame pizza place.  There is a lot of competition in the area with all types of ethnic restaurants so to win you really need to standout from other options. This restaurant is trying to position themselves as upscale authentic Mexican rather than TexMex.  The price point has moved up accordingly. There are some unusual items on the menu.The space is smallish but the ambiance is good.  The service was very good although our server was difficult to hear because she spoke softly in a place with background noise, but not a big problem.  We split an order of guacamole which was fresh made and spiced well.  Taste was very good and portion was a good size but I felt the price @ $11 for the basic house guac in this neighborhood is a bit high.Tacos are priced individually and come with nothing.  We ordered 2 tacos each.  They range from $3 to $4 each depending on topping.  They were good but not outstanding and on the smallish side.  We wanted to have something to accompany the tacos so we split a side order of rice and a side order of black beans.  Each side order was only enough for 1 person and they were $5 each.  So that means $10 extra for a single order of rice and beans.  There is no option to get an individual rice and beans supplement for ala carte taco order.  A fair price would be 5 bucks for a rice and beans add on to the taco plate.I had a tasty Dog Fish  IPA pint draft beer for 7 which was priced right for the area.  My girlfriend had a house margarita for $11 which came in a small rocks glass.  The margarita taste was good but the glass was full of ice so it was gone with a few sips.  The other mixed drink prices went up from here.For checkout the restaurant uses a tablet where you enter the tip and sign with your finger.  To speed up your tip calculation, the tablet provides a suggested tip click box for 15, 20, 25% of your total bill as well as a manual entry option.  The problem l had with the fixed calculation is that it used tax in its calculation.  It is standard that a tip is based on the food and beverage  cost with tax excluded.  If they are going to suggest % tipping it should be without tax.To summarize, we will probably give them somewhat of a pass since they are new and try them 1 more time in a month or so.  There are several high quality Mexican places offering more in the area like Tacuba, so Las Catrinas needs to consider a few adjustments in a crowded field to solidify their customer base.",3.0 star rating,"Old Bridge, NJ",3,1,0.10000000149,9.89999961853,"restaurant,space,time,neighborhood,restaurants,pizza place,options,area,lot,order,portion,rice,problem,liquor license,competition,types,@ $11,house margarita,Broadway,IPA pint draft beer,space,service,server,restaurant,place,Mexican,ambiance,side order,rice,side order,side order,price,order,price point,background noise,Tacos,tacos,tacos,places,option,items,carte taco order,Taste,side,black beans,beans,beans,rice,beans,problem,guacamole,neighborhood,house guac,area,glass,nothing,something,person,girlfriend,tip,Dog Fish,taco plate.,TexMex,tablet,entry option,calculation,calculation,tax,tax,bucks,bill,cost,beverage,food,area,more,tip click box,mixed drink prices,pass,adjustments,field,margarita taste,tip,tip calculation,restaurant,customer base,rocks glass,tablet,ice,sips,finger,checkout,tax.To,Tacuba,Las Catrinas","2,2,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,3","0.0944863185287,0.0822666436434,0.0486406795681,0.0486406795681,0.0273482948542,0.0272120926529,0.0254200622439,0.0254200622439,0.0247803367674,0.0228002723306,0.0221401881427,0.0217130128294,0.0215130094439,0.0208752993494,0.0202510412782,0.0202510412782,0.0192089788616,0.0121474023908,0.0120707098395,0.0119213601574,0.0107436133549,0.0104547087103,0.0104547087103,0.0104337055236,0.00962661672384,0.00958706438541,0.00940170791,0.00925113353878,0.00816321652383,0.00775570468977,0.00775570468977,0.0077540804632,0.00774166267365,0.00769540807232,0.00766268745065,0.00740628503263,0.00739640928805,0.00737187312916,0.0072431685403,0.00721030635759,0.00720656337216,0.00707909837365,0.00703847454861,0.00694934045896,0.00694229826331,0.00634171953425,0.00633653672412,0.00633167242631,0.00633167242631,0.00591343222186,0.00590343633667,0.00589463347569,0.00589463347569,0.0058829751797,0.00533033534884,0.00515756709501,0.00513358926401,0.005128770601,0.0049845171161,0.0047128922306,0.00468185916543,0.00468185916543,0.00457025784999,0.00446086609736,0.00438383221626,0.00438124826178,0.00438124826178,0.00419221166521,0.00398271065205,0.00354250101373,0.00348851690069,0.00348449591547,0.00348449591547,0.00348449591547,0.00302854296751,0.00275451783091,0.00267304759473,0.00266872439533,0.00241109472699,0.00240984698758,0.00240984698758,0.00209120172076,0.00207088445313,0.00192278949544,0.00189496146049,0.00184640497901,0.00175219099037,0.00174876849633,0.00153183983639,0.00153183983639,0.00153084355406,0.00153084355406,0.00142709352076,0.00142635474913,0.00142635474913"

So Sunday afternoon we stopped by for brunch on a beautiful sunny day. We were seating promptly and loved that there's a brunch and regular menu. There was no more than 5 other tables at this time. I ordered a blood orange margarita and my friend a Bloody Mary. He marg was great but the bloody was too chunky. We ordered Guac, chilaquiles, and huevo ranchero. While we were enjoying our drinks, about 20 minutes passed and still no guac. So we asked and finally it came. It looked pretty but unfortunately it was very under-seasoned and bland.

The secret to a good taco is the tortilla and theirs is airy and yum! I recommend the carne asada, pescado and al pastor tacos. Unclear what was going on but the service staff had no intention of making our experience memorable. The restaurant had 4-6 tables, so it wasn't busy. There was a host, 3 servers and maybe 5-6 people in the kitchen. I waited 5-10 minutes after finishing my first drink before going straight to the bar to order another because the server hadn't passed by. My boyfriend was never asked if he wanted anything else. Our food took 30-40 minutes to arrive - 4 tacos and a sandwich. We asked about 15-20 minutes in what was taking so long and it's possible it was never ordered? We left pretty frustrated. We really like this place and want to go back for the tacos but the staff is just not attentive. A manager would usually pass by in these situations but nobody did.

Not sure which bc I picked those out. I had the skirt steak, and it was delicious when paired with some green spicy sauce they gave us. The Colombian rice is so different from the Chinese rice I have been used to. The Colombian rice was super soft and it was flavorful, with a hint of salt, and it smelled great. I tried the $9 seafood soup, and it was so creamy and had so much flavor in one spoonful. I also tried the chicken fried rice, and it was really good! Worth trying because this was my favorite dish!

This is a place where the basic rotisserie chicken is not the main dish. This is a place that offers the diversity found in the Peruvian gastronomy. Overall, the food was amazing. The Choros a la Marinera were delightful and so was the Ocopa. On point!!! However, I chose Lomo Saltado and it was not what I expected. Onions were too thin and the little pieces of parsley were missing.

Strips of Beef, Tomato, Onions and French Fries with Cumin Seasoning and Soy Sauce.Arroz Frito con Camarones: Another popular dish. Nothing big like fried rice.Papa con Huacania Sauce: Excuse my spelling for this dish. It is boiled potatoes with creamy cheese sauce.Ceviche: It is pieces of fish cooked in lime juice. Please caution that they put a lot of red onions on it! Jalea: Dish filled with fried yummy fish that you can share for up to 4 people. No... there is no oil puddle in the bottom, it fried just right.Don't pick the ""usual dishes like chicken with rice and beans"". You will be disappointed! Take a risk and try something new like Picante de Mariscos, Aji de Gallina, Chupe de Camarones, Papa Rellena... but like I said you have to know some spanish to try their food.

My family still goes occasionally, but up until last Saturday I hadn't been here in a really long time. I decided to take my boyfriend here to check it out.The place is still as small as I remember and hasn't changed a bit. To some, it may seem too small and cramped but I actually kind of like it. It's homey and from a business perspective - I'd rather Nico keep the place small than have to hike up the prices just to pay the rent for a bigger place, but anyway. We must have come at the perfect time (around 6pm) because there was only one other table occupied (it wasn't until about 7 that more people started trickling in). For appetizers we ordered the ceviche mixto and causa rellena. I loved them both, very good. My boyfriend usually doesn't like causa but after a little coaxing he tried this one and became a fan. The chicken and sauce in the causa was very creamy and soft with the perfect amount of flavor in the potato. For our entrees we both ordered our favorite dishes - lomo saltado and tallarines verdes con bistec. The lomo saltado was very appetizing, very juicy and flavorful. The tallarines verdes was mouthwatering, perfect color (some other places put way too much cream or milk for the sauce and it comes out all wrong) and great taste and the steak was perfect.To my surprise the have helado de lucuma.

When I received my food it was a good size portion, and was the perfect amount of spice! The seafood was fresh and firm, not mushy or stale! The Ceviche had so much flavor! It was really amazing and I was super satisfied with my order. After dinner, I asked about desserts, they gave me a few choices and I chose the Lucama ice cream. I took it to go, and it is made locally and was about a half pint I believe. I ate that back at my hotel room, and it was very good also!

Las Llaves De Chile,5413,108-02B Northern Blvd,Corona,11368.0,194591,"Oh, how I wish I could give this place a better rating. There are comparatively few Chilean restaurants and bakeries, so it's important to support the ones that exist. But this place, they need to work on a couple of issues.1. Operating Hours: More than one friend has told me they arrived at Las Llaves and found the place was closed during what was suppose to be their normal operating hours. This is supremely frustrating and an effective way to discourage customers from coming. Fortunately, for us, it was open on our most recent visit.2. Competent Staff: Though they claim to be a bakery, the evening I was there, unbelievably there were zero -- ZERO -- Chilean pastries. We were told the baker was sick that day. Seriously? Only one person knows how to bake at a bakery? We were there on a Saturday at 9:00 PM, certainly there was plenty of time to get someone to pitch in. 3. Limited Food Options: Empanadas are a staple in Chilean cuisine; most likely the introduction to Chilean noms to us non-Chileans. The evening we were there -- there were no empanadas. They had not had any all day, because...you guessed it...only the baker makes the empanadas! For reals?  Also, my visit to Chile was seasoned with beautiful fresh salads and vegetable options. This place did not have even one salad on their menu. They did not even have a measly chopped lettuce with a few tomatoes to offer a hungry traveler. Come on, people! How is one to enjoy the simple, yet diving lemon juice and olive oil dressing that Chileans have perfected, without a bed of lettuce?4. Noise pollution: This place is not large in size:  I'm approximating that there were ten four-tops. Yet, the musicians were amped for a venue easily quadruple that size. I could barely hear across the table and had to literally shout to have friends hear me. I told my husband not to be surprised if blood started dripping from my ears.5. To Charge or Not to Charge: While it clearly states on their menus that they accept credit cards, the waitress informed us they did not. We pointed this out to her. She kindly referred us to the brightly lit ATM in the corner of the bakery. Sure. Don't mind at all using highly unsecured ATMs and pay a $4 users fee. The food was adequate. Both my husband and I had the Biffe a lo Pobre and found the steak a little chewy -- not the best cut of meat. Can't recall what my other friends had specifically, one was a beef stew/soup. She thought it was OK, certainly nothing to write home about. They do deliver, which excited one of my friends. That is, until she was told that she has to call ahead to see if they have someone there that can deliver. Evidently as experienced by the baker, their hours, and their business policy -- consistency is not really their thing.",2.0 star rating,"Rochester, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,15.3000001907,"place,ones,Chilean,bakeries,rating,place,place,friend,couple,restaurants,bakery,baker,Las Llaves,lemon juice,nothing,place,bakery,baker,staple,way,customers,Staff,pastries,place,plenty,Empanadas,someone,Food Options,visit,vegetable options,salads,salad,menu,lettuce,bakery,lettuce,size,size,noms,introduction,cuisine,reals,tomatoes,traveler,friends,empanadas,food,people,bed,olive oil dressing,Noise pollution,musicians,venue,husband,credit cards,baker,corner,users fee,steak,chewy,cut,meat,beef stew,Chile,one,friends,non-Chileans,thing,consistency,person,empanadas,someone,soup,home,business policy,blood,ATMs,lo Pobre,Biffe,friends,menus,table,waitress,husband","7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,1,2,2,1,3,7,7,7,2,1,6,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,2,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,3,1,7,1,7,7,1,1","0.0871716737747,0.0709443837404,0.0612793527544,0.0441371835768,0.0417833849788,0.0399630852044,0.0398184470832,0.0375086627901,0.0278702396899,0.026298860088,0.0203706659377,0.0198284015059,0.0164634604007,0.0163591299206,0.015372030437,0.0112910289317,0.0111868642271,0.0111295636743,0.0107281133533,0.010587118566,0.010587118566,0.0105420928448,0.0105420928448,0.00972355995327,0.00845097005367,0.00832922197878,0.00808867625892,0.00807157158852,0.00804418046027,0.00804418046027,0.00804418046027,0.00803835596889,0.00803835596889,0.00803284998983,0.00755054596812,0.00734164752066,0.00733732059598,0.00733318831772,0.00706215435639,0.00706215435639,0.00706215435639,0.0070435940288,0.0070282695815,0.0070282695815,0.0068759736605,0.0068748164922,0.00651794765145,0.0064273881726,0.00642341421917,0.00642341421917,0.00641962792724,0.00641601160169,0.00641601160169,0.0058128722012,0.00535111408681,0.00520957261324,0.00478138308972,0.00477720238268,0.00477329501882,0.00477329501882,0.00477329501882,0.00477329501882,0.004771433305,0.00476266210899,0.00474158627912,0.00446499465033,0.00418095802888,0.00409203255549,0.00404047174379,0.0039048907347,0.00384033354931,0.00377159961499,0.00351951178163,0.00330202281475,0.00329848378897,0.00295735173859,0.00283024436794,0.00282545527443,0.00282545527443,0.00256782746874,0.00239901104942,0.00210087536834,0.00209874333814,0.00186239834875"

The first time was on Valentine's Day and we both ordered the Texas omelet ($14) and a pitcher of mimosa (for $26, which was weak). The food was OK at best as well as the mimosas. We decided that the special occasion may not be an accurate representation of how they usually do, so we gave it another shot.The second time we came with a Groupon and it was NOT any better. In fact, it was WORSE. We told him we came with a Groupon when we were seated, and I felt as though he immediately treated is differently. He took away the original menus (understood), but then he also took away all of the napkins. I had to get napkins from the next table over!This time around, we both ordered the steak and eggs, which took forever to come out. We both asked for our steak well done, but that does not explain why when I cut through my steak, I could see blood!  after sending it back, it did look much better. The steak and eggs cost $14 as well, but it was obvious why. The steak was smaller than the size of my palm! We tried to do a pitcher of mimosas again, but they said they ran out, so we were given sangria instead. The waiter informed us that the sangria was stronger and more expensive than the mimosas ($35) and that he would make it ""special"" for us. The white sangria literally tasted like food-colored water with fruit in it... We also asked for toast which is normally free (it was free the first time we went) and they gave us 3 slices and charged $4!I'm giving them 2 stars because the potatoes were actually tasty.

Las Lunitas,5414,195 Stanhope St,Brooklyn,11237.0,180871,"Groupon prompted us to this place and unfortunately, we had a really, REALLY unpleasant experience. Upon being seated we were given menus which we noticed included free deserts (nice!) we then ordered a pitcher of mimosas, which were a part of our deal...When the mimosas arrived at our table they were a bit watered down, but due to the 100 degree day, we weren't really complaining...Our waitress then took our orders, I ordered the Texas omelette with steak...my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs initially, but was told there was no steak in the house...he brought up retrospectively, the fact that my dish had steak in it, so how was there no steak in the house? We laughed about it and thought why/how that could be...but brushed it off. He ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict. Oh well, we were starved!At the time that order was placed ourselves, and another table were the only customers in the place...the other table had gotten their food shortly after we placed our order and we thought, ""Great! Our food should come out fairly quick...""Quite some time had gone by...the other table that had been there before us came and went and by then, three other tables had been sat and served after us...More time passes....about an hour and we noticed all three of those tables had received their food before us...this was bothersome and so I got the waitresses attention. I asked what was up? She apologized, and admitted that a mistake had been made on her part and I was understanding...I myself waited tables for 8 years. Cool. Mistakes happen. Then my boyfriend interjected and asked the waitress how much longer our food would be? ...at this point it seemed her whole apologetic demeanor changed and she became very upset. She said something in Spanish, walked away and came back to our table with a desert for us to share. Saying that our meals would be out in another ten minutes. My boyfriend kindly declined on the desert mentioning, ""...isn't desert supposed to be complimentary? We would rather have food first, and desert after"" she became even MORE upset at this point...saying something about how that complimentary desert doesn't apply to groupon customers, which really confused us...then she took the plate of desert off our table and said, ""You don't want? Fine."" It was so so rude and unnecessary. Eventually the food came out was dropped to our table without a word, I ate my food, not sure if it was because I was so starved or that it was actually good. My boyfriend had two bites of his overly salted, eggs Benedict. Needless to say it was subpar. My boyfriend asked the waitress in Spanish if he could speak with a manager. Of course one wasn't there to speak with us. After we finished a very quiet and mood-killing brunch, the waitress came over and dropped a check charging us $4 for tax. Tax? You have got to be kidding me. When we DECLINED to pay the tax due to the terrible experience, the waitress along with the rest of the staff proceeded to talk nastily amongst eachother in Spanish about us.

I bought a groupon for this place for $30 which gives us brunch for 2 up to a $60 Value plus  bottomless mimosas. We arrived on a Sunday morning and was soooo pleased with the decor despite the place being cold inside.  We presented our groupon to the waiter who looked sloppy and sweaty for no reason.  We were given two mimosas in 3oz glasses that were not even full .Less than 5 sips it was done. Are you kidding me??? .. Anyways the waiter tells us that we are allowed $30 in food from the breakfast and sandwiches section only the costs of the food was between $6.99 and $9.99.. UMMMMM did your groupon offer not say it was $60 worth of food? wow. I held my tongue asked the waiter for the brunch menu instead of the regular menu and he gave me a run down. I ordered an entree for $10.99 my friend ordered a $7.99 breakfast.  That makes $18.98 total right? ... lets continue . I waited nearly 15 mins to get a mimosa refill cause the owner walked in and started having a heated exchange with the employee . Could you not have taken it to the back away from customers??????. I repeated my order nearly 4 times and after waiting nearly 30 minutes my steak was raw in the middle despite me saying well done. I overheard other patrons complaining about their food being cold and tasteless but we remained optimistic.   Waiting waiting..... My friend bit into her wrap. Cold and tasteless and why is there onions??? did she not say no onions??? wow wow wow.. She picks them out and humbly eats her wrap. My steak returns .....it was ok but way way too salty. When we were done he took  our plates away and we ordered two more mimosas. The waiter informed me that I had $11 credit left. I looked over the menu and order 2 cappuccinos.  I saw the owner look over at us then called the waiter to the side . They were going back and forth and back and forth then the waiter comes out and says ""Sorry my boss says that you are only allowed 2 entrees so I cannot give you any more food  and when you complete your meal you cannot get any more  refills on the mimosa. huh??????.He then hands me a bill for the 2 cappuchinos plus tax on $30 (tax on the value of the groupon which I paid which I only used $18.98 of)... I was soooooo pissed ... I paid for more food than I actually got???? So I donated $11 to this restaurant??? When I voiced my displeasure the boss dismissed me. He is rude and nasty. Thing is I ordered $25 and $30 lunches from these guys on seamless and to walk in here for the first time and see how they treat their patrons.. wow.....I thought I found a little gem in the neighborhood that I can bring my kids to every week for breakfast cause the prices are reasonable but boy was I wrong...

I was surprised how empty it was for a Saturday afternoon, but decided to give it a try since I was starving. Based on the name, I was expecting a mostly Latin American menu. Instead it was full of mostly classic American fare with a just a few Latin options. Since I had my heart set on something Latin, I ordered the huevos rancheros and absolutely LOVED them. It had this amazing tomato sauce that wasn't too spicy, and the dish as a whole wasn't too heavy. It came with a side of rice and beans. I steered clear of the beans (I'm not a bean person), but the rice was incredible. I don't know what they cooked it in, maybe they added some oil, but it had the most delicious flavor. After I finished the huevos rancheros, I dumped the remaining rice in the sauce to keep the fun going just a little bit longer...mmm...In terms of ambiance, I would say it's a little lacking.

Went here one Sunday when my cousin wanted to treat my sister, sister's son and girlfriend to A brunch via Groupon. The deal was a brunch for 2 for $30 bucks with bottomless mimosas. She also purchased an additional brunch (as stated) as a gift for my nephew and his girlfriend. At the last minute, my hubby and I decided to join them so we purchased our own Groupon for 2. The server Oscar greeted us very nicely and took our orders after we informed him of our Groupon that he redeemed for us. After waiting what seemed like eeons, he comes back out to inform us there was a limit on the Groupons. Only 1 per order; however the Groupon clearly states that there was a limit if 1 and one additional as a gift. Well that took care of the party of 4, but my hubby and I had purchased our own so if it was just a matter of seating, we could've moved our seats no problem. This was a minor misunderstanding that could've been sorted out in the back office; especially since it was only a matter of seating. Well, after some time calling the manager to confirm that it was ok, I already had a bad taste in my mouth about this place...and to make matters worse, they messed up my order completely and had to take it back! Meanwhile my hubby had already finished his food! How disappointing that after waiting so long for service (no glass of water , bread while we waited; nothing!) oh and I ordered a Spanish omelette, which turned out to be an omelette with onions and green peppers. I asked for some salsa to go with it as it was very dry and tasteless and they bring me some tomato paste concoction that was equally dissatisfying...I felt that they were punishing us for using Groupons,... I knew we had made a HUGE mistake patronizing this place, so much for supporting local business!

Delivery guy was friendly and I didn't have to wait for him at my doorway in my PJs.Grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes were barely warm, but they were good. Nothing special, but reminds me of grandma's cooking, RIP. I will probably order them again. My main reason for ordering: Strawberry short cake and marble cheese cake. Oh my god, I have never been so disappointed. :( The slices were SO small. $3.50 & $4 for a slice that was four inches long. The strawberry short cake was basically vanilla birthday cake with a strip of strawberry filling in the center. The marble cheese cake was tasteless, hardly had any chocolate and didn't even have a crust!! I thought chocolate graham crust was essentially for marble cheese cake. I thought having bakery in their name would imply awesome cakes. I was wrong. Maybe the fact I ordered late had something to do with it?

So the hostess here was super nice and let us hang at the bar while we waited for a table to open up outside on a perfect Memorial Day Monday evening. That was, unfortunately, the height of my service experience at Las Margaritas.After being seated, we were given menus by the hostess and then promptly ignored by our server for a solid 10-15 minutes. When she finally did come around to take our drink order, she gave me a blank stare when I asked her if they had any margs with agave nectar (instead of triple sec), which I took to mean a ""no"" - so I ordered a traditional marg and a water. Before we could order any apps, she was gone! About 10-15 min later, she came back with our margs and no water. When I mentioned the water, she gave me an exasperated stare and went to ostensibly fetch some for us.Many, many minutes later we finally got our app order in, as well as our entrees. I asked for a side of salsa and got ignored. I asked for more chips, since we had so much guac left and her response was to take the side of guac away. Hmmm. Ordering more drinks was a herculean effort. I can probably count on my hand 3 times in my life I've ever tipped someone below 20% and this girl got the privilege of being my fourth. And look, I know you're busy - it's a busy restaurant- so I don't mind waiting- but for goodness sake, just try and act like you're sorry or be slightly apologetic about it!

Because I hadn't been there in so long I decided to give the food a shot (to give them the benefit of the doubt) and ordered the steak nachos. The nachos were not made with steak but with ground beef - this isn't your traditional plate of nachos its LITERALLY 8 tortilla chips with ground beef, beans, sour cream and guac. TERRIBLE! The plate of 8 tortilla chips were $8.95 by the way.We also ordered a pitcher of strawberry margarita ($38). Now, I'm not a fan of flavored margarita so from my first sip I absolutely hated it. My boyfriend enjoys strawberry margaritas but even he (who is fairly shy) wanted the waitress to take the margarita back because AWFUL!

I had calamari another and their calamari was quite awful and my friends steak was cooked to the point where it was hard to chew. I personally haven't tried anything else but from what my friend said the chicken was good. Another disappointment was the service. As soon as we walked into the door we didn't know if to find seats ourselves or to wait. We waited for about three minutes and we decided to just go in. The waitress seemed quite lost but gave us a table. Throughout the diner of both my visits they were not helpful and seemed annoyed. I wanted to love this place but didn't :/If you still want to try this place out I would recommend going in and staying at the bar and enjoying their appetizers.

This Friday I came here with two of my girlfriends and decided to eat and start to drink for the night which usually consists of more food then that, and of course more drink as well.  I swear we were all trying to consume and with our experience were convinced by the end that the waitress didn't want us too.  She started off nice and then I don't know what happen, maybe she got over whelmed and then when she caught up was scared to come to the table again?..who knows.  I'm in the industry as well and know how it can be sometimes but think it could have been handled a little better.  I ordered guac, and did not receive it until after I got my other food and I had to ask for it, then when I got it I was full.  Of course I kept it and took it home but still.  Also all three of us stressed when we ordered (very nicely of course) that we need a lot of sour cream for our tacos and all the plates came out with no sour and trying to flag down the waitress for it was impossible.  We had to get someone else to get it.  We also had to keep asking for water.Oh! And it's a Mexican place with THE WEIRDEST selection of music.   Like one song would be like rock n roll the next salsa, the next some jazz or country, the next some shit to put me to sleep.  I asked the waitress to put on something else and she said she couldn't and that it was pandora....My place uses pandora as well and we are perfectly capable of changing the channel, maybe not to hard core hip hop or like heavy metal but at least some good Latina music or something.  Not really that important I know but I figure I add it in their anyways.

We started off with the Chorizo Fundido appetizer and the Fried Calamari. There were like, three pieces of Chorizo and the rest was just cheese.... it was meh. The fried calamari were good. As for our meals, we ordered the Enchilada suiza, the fajita and the Chorizo torta. Our food wasn't exactly the best Mexican I've had in my life but it wasn't as terrible as yelp suggests. We shared both the tres leches and the flan for dessert. The flan was homemade and delish and the tres leches was the frozen tres leches they serve like... everywhere. Overall our meal was not bad. As far as drinks, we ordered margaritas which were very, very  strong which might be good for some but lacked any lime flavor. We specifically told our waitress we wanted them on the rocks but granted, she brought them frozen. My coconut margarita kinda tasted like tequila with coconut and my sisters strawberry margarita was like pure rubbing alcohol with strawberry syrup. We also ordered a Mexican coffee which was way way strong and undrinkable. The service was near non-existent. The waitress seemed nice but she rarely checked up on us to see if we were ok. We were the only customers at the time yet we waited like 20 minutes for dessert. At the end of the day, I go to a restaurant for the food not the service. Our waitress wasn't like, rude or anything... she just did't really seem to care if we wanted anything else. We are really no fuss people so yes, we will probably be back.

Las Margaritas Restaurant and Lounge,5416,3801 Broadway,Astoria,11103.0,195112,"After checking out a movie today in Astoria, a friend and I decided to get Mexican food. This is like my third time here so I knew pretty much what to expect in terms of food quality here. Typically the food and service is  average and no where near as good as my neighborhoods El Paso's taqueria in El Barrio. Today however, the cook must have been in a especially good mood because the food was pretty damn good.  Better than usual. I ordered a multi-itemed plate consisting of a cheese burrito, (the corn meal wrapped in corn husk) forgot the name, and an enchilada.  While waiting for our food, we were seated near what appeared to be a son and father aggressively arguing about whose generation is/had screwing/screwed up the country. After 5 minutes of trying not to be annoyed by this intruding and stupid conversation, I noticed that the father and son were about to throw down. At that point things started to get interesting. But our food arrived and I asked the waitress to turn the music up to drown out the noise coming from the other table. She did and the music did drown out the ruckus. We chowed down, the food was on point, the waitress was attentive and before we realized it, the two  annoying political analysts were long gone.   Overall it was a decent experience.  The bill came out to $29 so it wasn't super expensive either.",3.0 star rating,"Kaneohe, HI",2,1,0.0,7.90000009537,"food,friend,movie,food,Astoria,Mexican,waitress,food,father,experience,food,average,cook,bill,terms,food quality,service,neighborhoods,taqueria,son,food,mood,name,plate,cheese burrito,corn meal,corn husk,enchilada,waitress,generation,country,intruding,conversation,El Barrio,El Paso,music,noise,table,ruckus,analysts,father,things,son,music","7,1,5,7,2,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,1,2,4,7,2,2,5,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,5","0.174150526524,0.0834406763315,0.0774552971125,0.0686252862215,0.0524035841227,0.0524035841227,0.0322903804481,0.0310556832701,0.0289631877095,0.0205734185874,0.0204170159996,0.0199696179479,0.0171002708375,0.017003916204,0.0161949116737,0.0161949116737,0.0161121748388,0.0161121748388,0.0161121748388,0.0150676295161,0.0137853724882,0.0108485622332,0.0107930572703,0.0107930572703,0.0107930572703,0.0107930572703,0.0107930572703,0.0107930572703,0.00998493470252,0.0098589938134,0.0098589938134,0.00984234921634,0.00984234921634,0.00955157913268,0.00955157913268,0.00837276596576,0.00733541278169,0.00733541278169,0.00732656475157,0.0050685252063,0.00487622292712,0.00453872745857,0.00368969189003,0.00192718976177"

How is that possible? we were seating ontop of invisible people?   Ok... We were moved. Fine, lets give this place a chance.   We all ordered our drinks a margarita pitcher a sampler and our entrees.  I ordered the margaritas enchiladas, mom had chicken quesadillas and hubby had a steak burrito.  10 minutes passed and we had no drinks.  Hmmmm? I see the waitress chatting by the bar, thought she was pushing them to make our drinks.  The food runner arrives with our appetizer sampler.... We still had no drinks, plus we were staring at our appetizers for 2 minutes because we had no silverware or plates.  Did I mention I work in the restaurant service industry?.  But honestly I think this background doesnt affect my judgement as much, At this point i just want common sence service.   We get our silverware and plates after we admired our appetizers presentation, which wasnt bad, it actually made me understand why this place is still standing.  Just when I was getting up to pick up my own margarita pitcher at the bar, someone arrived with our pitcher.  Not the waitress she was still too busy chatting... I dont even know her name cause she wasnt even wearing a name tag nor presented herself to us all i know is she worked saturday, september 19 at 3pm. Lets just call her terrible server,  like most people in there.  I think there is lack of management, the food was decent quality, I hated the look of mounster cheese floating on my enchiladas.  NOT MEXICAN!  But the flavours were good. Uniforms should be required, cause I dont know why everyone looked like they were hanging out at home on their day off.  I was just frustrated by the lack of obvious details missing in this place.  Maybe better management, professional service, name tags, service etiquette, traditional garnishes on food and drinks.  No mounster cheese, maybe chopped cilantro, no orange defintely lime on margaritas, no weekend bumming attire more mexican inspired or neat uniforms.  And defintely a good manager, someone to check up on people, no one asked if everything was ok, no one offered us an opology, or a dessert like most restaurants do.   I dont want anything for free, but wow this was a dissaster.",1.0 star rating,"Long Island City, NY",3,0,0.0,12.6999998093,"host,table,group,toddler,drinks,someone,Las Margaritas,sidewalk,silverware,waitress,appetizers presentation,manager,place,people,margarita pitcher,sampler,margaritas enchiladas,name tag,quality,Fine,hubby,mom,ontop,entrees,steak burrito,chicken quesadillas,drinks,drinks,sence service,anything,appetizers,place,pitcher,margarita pitcher,name,bar,appetizer sampler,plates,silverware,plates,chance,bar,waitress,food runner,restaurant service industry,judgement,background,drinks,service,margaritas,no one,place,food,management,lack,mounster cheese,home,details,name tags,service etiquette,garnishes,lime,cilantro,everything,people,uniforms,restaurants,dissaster,attire,opology,dessert,Uniforms,server,no one,lack,people,management,mounster cheese,enchiladas,everyone,look,MEXICAN,cause,flavours","1,7,3,1,7,1,2,2,7,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,6,7,6,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,2,1,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7","0.115103326738,0.0666199624538,0.055399402976,0.055399402976,0.0523771867156,0.0472119413316,0.0471772998571,0.0264540333301,0.0261717326939,0.0194058995694,0.0169142913073,0.013278436847,0.0129720456898,0.0125632043928,0.012470073998,0.0113434232771,0.0113283004612,0.0111456150189,0.0107433572412,0.0105904629454,0.0105605795979,0.0105605795979,0.0100000118837,0.00992584694177,0.00991261098534,0.00991261098534,0.00959984678775,0.00956220924854,0.00954706221819,0.00950370635837,0.00836687162519,0.00834756810218,0.00763389654458,0.00763389654458,0.00762422196567,0.00762420659885,0.00761705078185,0.00761039508507,0.00761039508507,0.00759283499792,0.00706098461524,0.00694360258058,0.00693909078836,0.00666455877945,0.00665329070762,0.00664818100631,0.00664818100631,0.00648712925613,0.00648712925613,0.00648424495012,0.00615937123075,0.00567839387804,0.00567577732727,0.00567577732727,0.00516475085169,0.00516007468104,0.00452080881223,0.00451864628121,0.00451656337827,0.00451656337827,0.00451656337827,0.00451455451548,0.00451455451548,0.0042646410875,0.00392626039684,0.00357253430411,0.00357099901885,0.00332727143541,0.00312549481168,0.00312415137887,0.00312415137887,0.00295779528096,0.00285420613363,0.00284221465699,0.0027803836856,0.00249700970016,0.00249560223892,0.00226973532699,0.00226973532699,0.00215410161763,0.0019856558647,0.00134259613696,0.00109218771104,0.000858674407937"

Las Margaritas Restaurant and Lounge,5416,3801 Broadway,Astoria,11103.0,53053,"I must be missing something. I don't understand why this place is so packed seemingly every time I walk by it. It's TERRIBLE.Every now and then, I like to avoid checking my Yelp reviews before going out and just see where I end up, just to try something out of my comfort zone. The hubby and I needed a quick bite, but it was late, so a lot of the kitchens at the places we'd normally go were closed. So we ended up here. We thought since it looked busy it must be pretty good. Too bad I didn't check Yelp until we'd already gotten a table. I instantly knew to set my expectations low. They were somehow not low enough.The hostess was fine, took us right to a table. The table was clean. Our server came over pretty quickly with water and then to take our order. Apparently we were wrong to just want Diet Cokes, because we didn't receive them until we were halfway through our meal. Our waters had been empty for some time by then too. The Diet Cokes were in cans. I just don't understand why it was so difficult to grab a couple of cans of Diet Coke. I could have gone to a convenience store, bought two sodas, come back, and finished them in the time it took to get our drinks. RIDICULOUS.The food came out in a timely manner, but it's not tasty. We started with the queso fundido with chorizo. It was okay. The cheese was mostly congealed when it came to our table. They served it with tortillas, which is the only thing that saved it. It was like having mini-quesadillas. We had saved some chips thinking we'd be able to use them with the queso, but no, definitely not. The queso was way too congealed to be scooped onto a chip. The salsa has a bit of a kick, so it was decent. We both had enchiladas. I had the ones with mole sauce. Worst mole sauce I have ever had. I scarfed the food only because I was that hungry. I didn't finish it. And after eating it, I just felt icky. Don't even get me started on the sorry excuse for rice. We barely saw our server after she took our order. She wouldn't even look over at our table when she was walking by to check on other tables. To her credit, she was insanely busy, and I actually believed her when she said she was having a bad night, which is the only reason I left a decent tip. And by insanely busy, I mean she had several tables outside and inside. In fact, I never saw most of the servers have time to breathe because they were running around so much getting things for people. Our server was nice when she was around, but like I said, drinks took forever, and we never got a water refill. She apologized and apologized, but things only went downhill. This is definitely a poor management problem. I've worked in restaurants before, and I can tell you, these servers have way more tables per person than they should. They can't give any time to any table. That's ridiculous. Either this place is understaffed or the mangers have no clue how to assign server stations. No one should have tables outside and inside. The hubby and I really tried to be patient and nice. Having worked at restaurants, we know when to cut slack to a place. But this restaurant deserves no slack.

Las Margaritas Restaurant and Lounge,5416,3801 Broadway,Astoria,11103.0,31670,"WORST RESTAURANT IN ASTORIA (maybe even all of NYC)Last Friday night, four of us stopped in for a quick bite to celebrate a friend's birthday. Las Margaritas looked crowded and we thought the food could be decent. Unfortunately we had the worst dining experience I've ever had in New York City. We sat down and waited twenty-five minutes until our waitress came over. She refused to take both our food and drink order. When another waitress came over to take our food order, I asked for a substitution on one of their combination platters. The waitress was enraged. She told me it was too confusing and then told everyone else not to bother her with changes. She then came back 5 minutes later demanding our drink order again. When she brought our drinks to us, she threw them onto the table. One can of coke that she gave us was coated in a red sticky liquid. We all ordered waters, but literally asked for them 5 times. Finally we had to go to the bar ourselves to get the waters. It then took over an hour after we ordered for our food to show up. We were starving and hoping that the food would redeem the entire experience, but my meal was ice cold. I had a cheese enchilada, tamale and chile rellano. Everything was coated in canned sauces and became soggy, half of it had ice crystals on it, the cheese was congealed and I had to eat chips instead of my meal. When I complained to the waitress she didn't offer to reheat my meal. Considering that it took a full hour for us to get food, I figured why wait another hour to get more inedible food. Plus every waitress seemed to be outraged if we talked to them or asked for our food or drinks.

The rice and beans were absolutely without flavor. Now how do you mess THAT up? For $15.95. Bleh. But I was SO starving, I ate it. It sat on the bottom of my stomach all night and hasn't digested yet!The chips and salsa: so easy to make really, were stale tortillas with bland jarred tomato salsa.

The margaritas were decent but pricey, and I love their enchiladas suizas.We usually only go during brunch, and the prices aren't too high. HOWEVER, in the last month or so they have began blaring  the most awful techno music at 1 p.m. It's usually stationed to a Hispanic music party radio station full of screaming commercials in Spanish and the worst music that I've ever heard.The last time we went, after a 45 minute game we usually have to play in our neighborhood of ""What's the least offensive restaurant to have brunch in Astoria?"", we were beaten into having to go to Las Margaritas with knowledge of the offensive sounds pounding from their speakers. There were three other people in the restaurant, most of whom were alone and  trying to read their book, and we sat down as we were unbelievably thirsty and hungry. Unfortunately, I just couldn't take it and we walked out. We would go back IF the management turned this restaurant back into a restaurant and quit playing in to the trashy techno disco cafe theme that abounds in my neighborhood.Come on, Astoria, get it together.",2.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",2,0,-0.300000011921,5.0,"Astoria,restaurant,restaurant,boyfriend,review,Texas,restaurant,chips,salsa,patron,legitimacy,staple,music,chips,salsa,Mexican,I,restaurant,margaritas,techno music,music,techno disco cafe theme,brunch,people,neighborhood,enchiladas,radio station,commercials,prices,book,game,sounds,restaurant,Spanish,neighborhood.,restaurant,management,restaurant,brunch,knowledge,speakers,most,Las Margaritas","2,2,2,1,5,2,2,7,7,1,7,6,5,7,7,2,2,2,7,5,5,7,4,1,2,7,3,5,7,5,4,7,2,2,2,2,1,2,4,7,1,1,2","0.396844834089,0.0726323798299,0.0706957951188,0.059582926333,0.0464843437076,0.0413877032697,0.0282125826925,0.0204790588468,0.0204790588468,0.0179339051247,0.0179339051247,0.0179339051247,0.0167208649218,0.0138570815325,0.0138570815325,0.0137070082128,0.010644284077,0.00962183158845,0.00728491367772,0.00721784867346,0.00719162682071,0.00685611693189,0.00659985328093,0.00599059043452,0.0059875510633,0.00577547214925,0.00572501728311,0.00572501728311,0.00542122405022,0.00529127661139,0.00523948622867,0.00437743961811,0.0042506060563,0.00310312816873,0.00307700806297,0.0027051740326,0.00269217183813,0.00222723186016,0.00196347362362,0.00171780656092,0.00171780656092,0.00169136968907,0.00116224109661"

First, one should never trust a place with notoriously bad service on a holiday. It was beyond comically bad. We were seated quickly and that would be the last time the word quick will be used in this review. After spending some time memorizing the menu, our waitress finally came over and took a drink order. We waited. And waited. And waited some more. Finally, she comes over again to take our drink order. Yes, I know I mentioned that she took it earlier, dear Yelp reader, and both you and I remember that happening, but alas, she did not. This time, however, we were ready to order it all - and so we did. Twice. Because after the first time, she thought it might be a good idea to write it down. Ok, no problem. So we sit there and wait. And wait. And wait some more. Meanwhile, our eardrums begin to bleed from the incredibly loud music. After dabbing our bloody ears with our sleeves (because we still haven't got napkins, utensils, or chips and salsa), we flag down our harried waitress and ask her where our drinks are. Apologetically, she says they're coming. We ask if we can get chips, utensils and napkins. Sure. She actually comes back with that stuff (eventually). Now our mouths are on fire from the salsa, with no drinks to soothe the pain. FINALLY, our drinks come (yay!) only for our meal to be interrupted by the sound of shattering glasses right behind us. A different waitress comes hurrying over and moves us to another table, as our original table was surrounded by shards of glass. Okay, fine. Now FINALLY, we can relax and enjoy our drinks... or can we? No. The strawberry frozen margarita tasted like cheap tequila and little more. The Diet Coke was excellent, however, as the Coca Cola bottling company sure knows how to put that stuff in a can. Heck, at this point I didn't even want the waitress popping the top of said can! So fast forward to about 30-40  minutes later and we get our food. I ordered the chicken fajitas (because frankly, with how poor the service was, I was starting to worry about the food... and who can screw up fajitas? Even I can make those!). The waitress drops them off, seeming almost proud of herself for actually bringing us something. Comes back with the tortilla holder and rice and beans. I open the holder and -- uh, where are the tortillas? I had to go hunt down the waitress for the tortillas. Ok. I've got my food, my wife has her food and we can finally eat. At the first opportunity we get the check, pay it (to her credit, the waitress did take the drinks off). Never, EVER ignore Yelp reviews.

Las Nortenas has migrated west, down Roosevelt from Corona, capitalizing on the $2.50 taco price that is sadly becoming commonplace all over Queens, especially in this part of town.The woman behind the cart is a sweet woman (Ximena?) who knows her taco meats and knows we love it late at night. Though she speaks English well, her face always lights up when folks dish out their best attempt at ordering in Espanol. She's not exactly the quickest taco maker ever, which means a small crowd can develop here at any given time.Most of the time, the tacos are made with love. At $2.50 a pop, I still cringe at the thought of paying for these babies, especially when they're a tad on the smaller side. They're usually served on a small corn tortilla, with a choice of meat with one's usual garnishes of onions, cilantro, and salsa roja/verde. I've eaten several carnitas and lengua tacos from here, all of which are solid but not better than anything in Jackson Heights or even in Sunnyside.What I do like is their quesadillas. They're not your taco bell version but the more traditional Mexican version, which for some folks resembles a large taco that is folded over in a flour tortilla. Their quesadillas de chicharon and de papa are pretty tasty, especially during those nights when there are one too many cervezas in the system.Las Nortenas is not a cart to write off any time soon. If things get better I can see this becoming a popular spot for commuters coming from the 7 Train.

Las Margaritas,5418,83-22 37th Ave,Jackson Heights,11372.0,166491,"My partner and I went to this place today, and put simply, it was really bad. It was a good reminder of why we try to eat at home.Right after we sat down, we got some free chips and salsa, which was cool, we thought, until we tasted the salsa. It seemed as though the chef had accidentally spilled about 5 tablespoons of salt into the tiny salsa cup. It was almost inedible. The chips were also salt overload, and I couldn't really eat too many. We moved on to the food and started off with what the menu referred to as ""Fresh Guacamole."" This consisted of (from what we could tell) an avocado or two mashed up in a little bowl, with super salty tortilla chips around it, for 7 bucks. Not good. Not guacamole, even. And the chips, again, looked as though they had ice crystals attached to them, they were so unbelievably salty. We also ordered what the menu referred to as ""Jalapeno Rellenos,"" which were, let's be serious here, jalapeno poppers. These things had a dense crust of disgusting chemically-tasting breading surrounding some tasteless, limp, pepper-like vegetables, with very artificial, neon-orange cheese inside. You could probably get better cheese-filled jalapenos at a movie theater, or maybe from a box, or perhaps in a garbage can. Those things were also ridiculously salty.Being vegetarian (as of a month ago), we were kind of disappointed at the menu options, though maybe if you like sketchy meat this would be a good place for you to go. For us, though, our entree choices seemed limited to a vegetable burrito and a vegetable chimichanga. I ordered the burrito and my partner had the chimichanga. Yuck. Both were ginormous, but they were seriously grody. The ""vegetables"" turned out to be the kind that had obviously been frozen in a large bag only minutes before our order was placed, consisting mostly of green bell pepper chunks. The inside of my burrito was comprised of those and some watery cheesy goo. The handful of limp greens added to the plate did not much improve matters. There was also a hair in my food, ick. Everything, again, was ocean water salty. I drank 3 glasses of water while we were there and I left feeling as though I had ingested a handful of water softener pellets.We still feel rather ill, and we only ate about 5 bites of this nastiness. We pretty much asked for the check as soon as the waitress (who was very nice - it's not her fault) came to ask how everything was. We politely refused ""to-go"" boxes.To conclude, do not go to this place. It is gross and entirely too much money for the grossness.

Such a disappointment that falls just too short . Had the chicken quesadillas and those were tasty , the best out of the 5 options of food we had at the table . The calamari tasted too ""fishy"" as it was just at Verge of going bad . No Bueno The entrees were no exception to our disappointment in flavor. The arroz con pollo was so tasteless , I had 3 bites and was done . Chicken tastes like a grocery store bought rotisserie chicken, shredded and tossed in whatever rice they had let . The bandeja classica was terrible , friends chicken tacos again awful , one bite and they were done .

The sandwich comes out and it has cheese. My guest is allergic to cheese so we let the waiter know. Our waiter insists the menu says the sandwich comes with cheese and he will not change it. He shouts, grabs the menu, turns on his flashlight repeating that the menu says it comes with cheese, he then he finds the item. On the menu, it DOES NOT say it comes with cheese. He has embarrassed my guest and more importantly treated us with an incredible amount of hostility and disrespect. You do not yell at a child and shove a menu in their face. The waiter's name is DARIO. Yet when we asked for a manager the host told me no one was available. How is there no one in charge on a Friday night? Then I asked that we get another waiter and explained the situation. The host then laughs and does nothing. We end up still having the same waiter. When then later find out, the manager has been at the bar the whole time.

You better remove that comment, I'm gonna keep an eye on you, if you don't remove it, you are in big trouble"" This entire experience is outrageous.

I have to say that they give you a lot of food for the prices that they offer. Now its true what the previous reviews have said about price. This place is a bit pricey but its worth it when you see the amount and quality of the food that they give you. My cousin ordered some rice and it came in a small pot but as he kept on scooping some out it seemed like it didn't go down. It brought so much he took more than 70% home and let me say that he ate a lot of it. I had the empanadas at this place and it was really good. Nice crunchy exterior and delicious filling. The rest of the menu features a lot of interesting dishes and dishes that sound very delicious. Wish I had tried some of the other things on the menu.Bar:This time I sat at the bar with two other people and the service at the bar is great. They have three TVs so you get the perfect viewing spot no matter where you sit at the bar. At first we had a guy serve us - he was great- but then this young Venezuelan girl and she started serving us. She was very friendly and she seemed like she enjoyed what she was doing.

We wound up ordering typical Colombian food. Of course it wound up being way too much food to consume at once but we had leftovers for later.The service was fast and the waitress was very nice and eager to please.I ordered churrasco chicken. Which is basically a grilled chicken breast it came with rice, salad and fries but I substituted fries for tostones. I didn't like the texture of the chicken in some parts it was mushy and had no flavor. Rice was fine, tostones were two huge pieces, mushy as well. I added chimuchrri sauce and salsa verde which wasn't spicy at all.  My bf ordered the bandeja it comes with rice, beans, grilled steak, chicharron, arepa, fried egg, avocado and sweet plantain all for 15.50. I tasted his and it was ok We also ordered guacamole and a soup of the day which happened to be beef rib soup. I didn't try it but my bf said it was good. The guacamole was ok but needed a little heat, salt & lime juice.Overall their food was bland and the menu was overwhelming. It claims a Mexican place but they have cuisine from several different Latin American countries,  perhaps they're trying to cater to the diverse population.

We only had a mixed fajitas and took forever to come out and the beef was horrible. The only good thing was the guacamole but nothing special.

We came for food and did not order drinks. This, it seems, was a mistake. I ordered a beef burrito and my wife ordered chicken fajitas. The beef burrito was the worst burrito I have ever had. It was ridiculous, as if made by someone who has never actually seen or eaten a burrito.  It consisted of tons of sliced (not ground) beef wrapped in a shell, with a little cheese and a few random pieces of green pepper. That's it. Completely disgusting and ultimately indelible, though I did try.  The burrito came with rice and beans. Some grains of the rice were crunchy, as if either waaay undercooked, or very old. The chicken fajitas were similarly bizarre, all chicken and almost nothing else. Truly the worst Mexican or tex-mex food we have ever had.

On their menu is says Tex Mex but when we looked over the menu it was not that at all. It seemed like a mix of Portuguese and Spanish food. The menu was just whatever. Very bland it all seemed. I ordered beef tacos and when they came I was equally surprised and let down. Instead of ground beef it was chunks of dry ass meat tossed in the center of a tortilla. How do you serve tacos with no sauce or greens in it? Solid 3/10. Our server was extremely slow.....EXTREMELY. Things were also sort of getting lost in translation.

Las Margaritas,5418,83-22 37th Ave,Jackson Heights,11372.0,35310,"Not bad, not great either. I got the chimichanga with chicken, which was fairly small, and average tasting. Half the plate was taken up with a half-hearted salad and a ramekin of weak and thin vinaigrette. I like salad, but it wasn't mentioned on the menu as coming with the chimichanga, so it seems a bit like the purpose is to hide the small size of the ENTREE itself.But we were mainly there to satisfy my wife's semi-annual craving for steak in some form. When her sandwich arrived at the table, it was a respectable size. However, most of the sandwich was bread. The pieces of steak were very tender and fairly juicy, but it lacked the sort of spices you'd normally expect to get with steak. The only additional flavor came from several slices of generic American cheese melted onto the sandwich. No onions or peppers or other vegetables. No surprise salad either. Yet somehow the grilled steak salad menu item costs $2.50 more. The second half of her sandwich did do well coming home in the box, but it was eaten relatively soon after getting back, and we don't live that far away.Neither of our meals had especially attractive presentation, We were also given a free bowl of chips before ordering. The chips were okay, but the ""salsa"" that came with it might as well have been marinara.My wife ordered a Long Island Iced Tea which had been mixed waaay too strongly (which says a lot as she has a very high alcohol tolerance). The waiter took it off the bill when she complained, and for that we give more points than are lost by the mis-mixed drink.

Las Margaritas,5418,83-22 37th Ave,Jackson Heights,11372.0,5847,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because my boyfriend finally found a local place that makes good churrasco. He was in heaven! So basically my bf ordered churrasco (duh) w a side of white rice, fries & a house salad. I ordered the vegetable tacos (3 tacos per order). My order was cool but it was a corn taco instead of flour and I hate corn tacos. The vegetable mix for the filling was really bland. So I jazzed it up w more salt, pepper, some lime and guacamole. We did order chips & Guac only to deduce that the Guac was bland. So my bf and I added lime and salt. Big difference! The frozen passion fruit margaritas were good. Not enough alcohol for me but I should have ordered an extra shot in all fairness. We got here at around 10-ish. Most places are dying to kick you out on a late Sunday night but they were open till late so we got some great service.

The bill was $106 and I added a $20 tip to the bill. When I checked my credit card statement I was surprised to see that I was billed for an extra $20. I called my bank and we did a conference call with the restaurant to try to get the bill fix which I have a copy of it, and the person who answered the phone said that she was a waitress by the name of Valentina and asked me to call later to speak with the assistant manager since the manager was off on Tuesdays. I called and spoke with Frank ( assistant manager) and he said that he couldn't help that I needed to come in the next day and speak with the manager.   I went to the business to speak to the manager since I was in the area, one of the bartender told me that he wasn't around to come back I explained to her what happened when the manager happen to walk in, as I tried to approach him in a very rude manner he kept on walking  toward the back of the restaurant and said he will be back. I waited 10 minutes to see if he would return that's when I decided to leave. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt , I went out of my way to try to get this corrected and it seems that the management in this place does not care. $20 is not a lot of money and I know I will be getting it back and I'm sure I have wasted more than $20 by doing all of this however  If you go to this place and you pay with credit card make sure to double check your statement!!!!Bad way of doing business!!!",1.0 star rating,"East Elmhurst, NY",2,0,-0.20000000298,3.20000004768,"time,manager,place,review,Frank,waitress,bill fix,Yelp,group,friends,friends,dinner,drinks,couple,manager,one,bill,manager,bill,assistant manager,manager,credit card charges,credit card statement,tip,bank,restaurant,business,copy,name,phone,conference call,area,bartender,place,lot,way,management,doubt,money,Valentina,credit card,place,way,business,benefit,statement,all,restaurant,back,manner","7,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,3,1,1,7,7,1,1,1,5,1,5,1,1,7,7,7,3,2,3,6,7,7,4,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7","0.405211240053,0.10296677053,0.0529242269695,0.0502768903971,0.0469775535166,0.0282395314425,0.0236397348344,0.0203341878951,0.0190120469779,0.0186663120985,0.0186663120985,0.0163452550769,0.0163452550769,0.0163452550769,0.0152690187097,0.0115615613759,0.00933457817882,0.00787098426372,0.00782028026879,0.00659345462918,0.0065782610327,0.00625791633502,0.00624596467242,0.00622588675469,0.00618576677516,0.00477434694767,0.00435073021799,0.00417761597782,0.00417761597782,0.00417761597782,0.00417761597782,0.00380686088465,0.00380686088465,0.00356281548738,0.00351698650047,0.00324065960012,0.00283695897087,0.00283538992517,0.00283538992517,0.00247382139787,0.00246707443148,0.00246707443148,0.00230152206495,0.00224390346557,0.0020135990344,0.00197672192007,0.00196318258531,0.00142610573675,0.00124764058273,0.00124764058273"

(This says a lot though, because I have a respectably high tolerance for mixed drinks, beer, and wines.)Free chips and a small plastic cup of ""salsa"" came when we sat down. I don't like many spicy foods, but even I thought this tasted more like a weak red sauce then salsa. I've MADE better salsa than that!We ordered our food. The chicken chimichangas for him and a steak sandwich for me. (I had asked how big the more $$ Grilled Steak Salad was and I got a hald hearted ""eh...well... you could say it's big I guess..."" So I went with the simpler sandwich. It came on the plate as a sandwich and nothing more. Bread, steak, and supermarket American cheese.

This place is no where like the Latin American ""Applebees"" equivalent.  Applebees is actually... better. The menu seems delectable - with many dishes flaunting ""Las Margarita's own special marinade"" - but disappoint on arrival.  In a neighborhood that is so well known for great Colombian/Mexican/bar establishments, it's a wonder how this place still survives.  Save yourself the trip and walk down a few blocks to a real Colombian steak place...and if you're in the mood for drinks?

Las Margaritas,5419,7206 3rd Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,34597,"Las Margaritas continues to be my go-to spot for Mexican food. I've had their Chicken burrito with the special sauce several times and it is big and yummy, so flavorful and moist. They don't skimp on the chicken either. For the longest time burritos were the really the only thing I'd order when I'm in the mood for Mexican because the other items, from other places, that I've tried over the years have been bland by my standards. But last night I decided to branch out and try their cemitas (I would describe this as a Mexican version of a mega panini on a sesame bun ), I ordered the spicy pork one.  Oh wow!! It blew my taste buds away, that sandwich has really made me appreciate Mexican flavors, which I never really understood. This sandwich was jam-packed with delicious, multilayered flavor. It had cheese, avocado, tomatoes, black beans, some kind of Mexican pepper (not hot) and thin slices of the best tasting pork I've had in a long time. It was da bomb!  I also ordered their shrimp tacos. I'm usually not a fan of corn tortillas but the contents of this one was so delicious and guacamole so luscious, I didn't mind it at all.  The only thing I didn't like about the fish tacos was the side...there wasn't one. You have the option of fries or salad, I chose salad and all I got was 3 pieces of radish, which I don't  like. I refrain from giving this place 5 stars because I haven't tried most of items on the menu, they were 15 mins late with my last order, and I tried the chirozo burrito once which was tasty but the chirozo itself was less than stellar.

It is bigger than other taco places I have been too, so it does cost a little more than the other places, but worth it. I usually order the chicken and al pastor tacos. They are my favorite. The only thing I am not fully satisfy with is ordering take out. I would order through Yelp/Eat 24 or through the phone. I would be told 5-10 minutes; however, when I get to the restaurants 10-15 minutes later, I still need to wait for my food.

And it was the only thing that was wrapped in the tortillas. The green sauce had a metallic tang to it, and was not very good. There was no cheese in the enchilada; instead there was some kind of cheese (slice) that had been laid across two of the enchiladas and melted. Not sure what kind of cheese, but it didn't compliment the enchiladas at all.

Las Margaritas,5419,7206 3rd Ave,Brooklyn,11209.0,3726,"*More like 3.5*I've heard a lot of neat things and have seen a lot of amazing food pictures from Las Margaritas. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner with our friends and luckily, the restaurant was quite empty so we were able to choose anywhere we wanted to sit.The restaurant was quite spacious, but with minimal decor. Staff was friendly and helpful. The food I had a love/hate type of feelings.Chips and salsa - these were complimentary and the staff gave us a complimentary basket of tortilla chips and salsa which was quite tasty.Fried Pork & Lamb Tacos - these were the tacos I ordered, but I only tried the fried pork taco because the lamb taco was very spicy. The fried pork tacos were delish! The fried pork was really crispy and had an excellent crunch to it and that was the BEST part! Unfortunately, the rest of the taco wasn't mindblowingly delicious. I felt it was rather mediocre in terms of taste. The tacos from Las Margaritas are similar to the ones from Tacos El Bronco, but the taste and the size is different.Beef Tostadas - I've never had a tostada before, but I was curious so I ordered it. The presentation of it was beautiful and vibrant. The beef tostada was delightful with so many layers of flavors, textures, and colors. I would order this again.Horchata - I accidentally ordered a large horchata, because past reviews said that the small size is really small. I really enjoyed the horchata because it was very refreshing, cool, and not too sweet. The perfect drink for a hot night!Other items our friends ordered, but we didn't try -* Chicken Chimichanga * Beef ChimichangaBoth the chimichangas were huge! I was very impressed.* CactusThis is the first time I've seen a restaurant served cactus. Our friends ordered this and tried it, but my boyfriend and I weren't as daring as they were.Sweet Plantains - as a side dish, we also ordered this and they were cooked perfectly, but I wished there was more of a crunch to it.Overall, I am glad we tried Las Margaritas, but I felt the quality wasn't as great as the food from Tacos El Bronco. It felt like there was a missing touch.

I was a bit incredulous to learn that mole (the generic word for ""sauce"") has a chocolate base. Chocolate in my dinner entree? Yes, please. Along with the enchiladas came a side plate of yellow rice and black beans, which were extremely flavorful.

Every time we eat them we can't believe how tasty they are and not to mention LOADED with meat! They use corn tortillas rather than flour for their tacos. Heavenly! You can't get a better deal for your money. My boyfriend is a steak connoisseur and he loves their steak. It's grilled to the level that is asked for with a nice char on the outside. He tried the rib eye steaks and was truly impressed with the flavor. We were first hooked when we tried their chips and salsa. The salsa is so unique and unbelievably delicious.

I also remember this place being better when it was on the other side of the street.The first thing I had was the mojito which was good but wasn't fresh with the sugar cane. The Pina coladas tasted as if their was no liquor in them so was not too impressed with that either. For food I ordered a chicken taco and a carne asada taco. The only thing that really appealed to me was the fact that it was loaded with guacamole. Other than that nothing memorable to me. I also had an empanada and it was extremely dry and the chicken was not flavorful. Im less than impressed with this place. I didn't really think anyone I was with was thrilled with their food either.

We order from there so often that when they moved to the larger space across the street I felt like a booth should have a plaque with our names on it. What to get: any of the tortas. Particularly the chorizo, al pastor or poblano. Any poblano dish is really tasty. The chicken mole platter is good. The tacos are solid. And if you want to throw down for a nonalcoholic beverage, the melon and pina coladas are worth the expense. And the guacamole is consistently tasty.Ok but not great: the burritos.

I had ordered delivery on this cold cold night and my order arrived in less than 40 minutes.My boyfriend and I had ordered a whole bunch with our starving stomachs. I had the Half Chicken with two sides ($8) in which I had rice and beans. The chicken had the perfect, crispy skin and the meat was tender and moist all around, even after it cooled down. I literally had enough to pack for lunch the next day. He had the Al Pastor Torta ($6.95) which we expected it to be like the deli sized sandwich on a roll but NO it was a good 1.5-2x bigger and also STUFFED generously with meat, lettuce, avocado, pickled jalapeños and cheese. Then we also ordered two Al Pastor tacos and a Pollo taco ($2.95 each). Oh and Horchata ($2.95) with expectations it'd be watered down but it was the perfect cinnamon flavor. Everything was PHENOMENAL. We had so much leftover because we underestimated the portion. We were very regretful because we should've tipped way more than we did but Las Margaritas has become one of our go tos in the area.

After I placed an order for pickup and saw she did the same thing again, I confronted her and then she just shrugs her shoulder and basically says she doesn't care. Its such a shame to leave your business in the hands of shitty employees who dont care about the customers. The final straw was when I asked for a container of hot-sauce and she tried to charge me $1 each (shamelessly) for tiny cups of sauce.

Las Palmitas Deli,5420,10915 Jamaica Ave,Richmond Hill,11418.0,99,"There is a reason I did not post pictures of the food which is counter my review methodology. Driving home the aroma coming from my take out bag was just tantalizing enough to keep my attention. The three taco combo and one of my favorite soups from any culture, menudo was secured in the passenger seat as we sped away. Menudo is the best cure for a hangover and with the night I had last night with crazy friends who have not been together in a while add in a live band, kegs, bonfires and that was the basics of a super long night.The aluminum wrapped packets were endless as I emptied out the bag's contents onto my dining room table. The Lengua taco was the first on the plate and I generously added spicy guacamole, which I added as a side order for $3.25. Once the taco opened the meat literally rolled out as it was bursting from the tortilla like an over stuffed sausage casing. The last thing on my mind was taking pictures. Tender and flavorful the meat was so prominent. I could only muster up the appetite for one bite of the Chorizo taco as the Lengua was so filling and I was scooping intermittant ladle sized helpings of menudo into my mouth.

Las Perlas Salvadorian Restaurant,5421,16008 46th Ave,Flushing,11358.0,47729,I am definitely a fan of this place. Don't be fooled by looks. The outside and inside doesn't look like the greatest but that's where the not the greatest pretty much ends. This place has some of the most amazing Yucca fries I have ever tasted. Something airy like your first time as a child with a donut. And they are pretty cheap in terms of price. If you are a french fry lover I highly recommend trying Yucca Fries but only from this place. I order them without the chicharron accompaniment. It comes served with like this no mayo coleslaw that has a vague sour craut and it also comes with some sort of watered down marinara sauce that isn't bad. But try them with ketchup. You will love it. I can vouch highly for this place on the Yucca fries alone. I also sometimes get grilled chicken tacos. I tell them to use chicken breast though. This place is El Salvadorian but they sure do know how to fill that spot for a craving of Mexican food. Oh and their chicken Parm is OUTFREAKINGSTANDING. The customer service is amazing too.

At night, it feels like the resto has undergone a complete make-over. Walking in, we were soon seated in the restaurant front but little did I know that the resto extended all the way back, with cosier tables at the back. And there was where we ended up. Since the name of the resto touted lasagna, I couldn't give it a pass. Huge servings of lasagna appeared at the table beside us and I already had in mind to pack 1/2 of my portion home before I contemplate starting on it. I opted for the veal lasagna and happy to report that I enjoyed it to the last bite. The thing though was most of the veal ended up at the sides of the lasagna. So while I worked from one side to another, reaching the middle part, I was somewhat dis-satisfied with the pasta sheets with sauce sans meat. Then when I discovered more veal at the other end, I had to make my way through it.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,194907,"So me and a friend of mine came to this restaurant for bottomless brunch after our Saturday class because we came here last year, sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely attentive so we thought ""hey it should be the same again this time."" So we came here last weekend by 3:30 I believe, we got seated and got our menus. We knew we wanted the bottomless drinks so that's what we asked the waiter to start with. Got our first Bellini and drank it pretty quick, also put in our food order. We got our food and finally got another refill (so keeping count on the drinks here, that's 2 bellinis) my eggs were made over-easy instead of sunny side which is no big deal because the yolk is still runny, my friend also got hers over-easy after asking for over-medium. We were just chatting while eating and noticed that we weren't getting a refill on our bellinis so o called the waiter over for another one, he clearly says ""oh, this is almost finished, let me make another one."" Our cups were only filled half way. Once again eating and chatting, the waiter never came back to refill our cups or even make another batch of bellinis. The bill came up to over $60 for 2 mediocre meals and 2 and a half bellinis! The waiters catered to other people quicker than they catered to us, why pay $11 for bottomless drinks if you only get 2 and a half drinks while you're there and then seem to be rushed out when the waiter gives us the check before we even asked for it which is very rude. I would totally understand if they close the restaurant for dinner service but why didn't he let us know that they literally cut off making more mimosas or bellinis exactly at 4. If we knew that then we would've just ordered regular drinks that were stronger. It was so upsetting and to be honest, the waiter didn't deserve the tip we gave him.This place is lucky I chose 2 stars because I thought about the service the first time we came which by the way was amazing only at that time.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.20000000298,8.69999980927,"bartender,side,restaurant,friend,waiters,mine,brunch,class,bar,bellinis,waiter,friend,cups,waiter,drinks,waiter,bellinis,drinks,bellinis,bellinis,yolk,eggs,refill,menus,drinks,way,bellinis,bill,food order,over-medium,o,Bellini,count,meals,one,mimosas,refill,dinner service,people,waiter,time,waiter,batch,tip,restaurant,half drinks,service,way,him.,place,stars,drinks,pay,check","1,7,2,1,1,2,4,4,2,7,1,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,4,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7","0.0718397200108,0.071270018816,0.0688045024872,0.0688045024872,0.067079693079,0.0603090748191,0.0603090748191,0.0603090748191,0.0603090748191,0.0462961159647,0.02752558887,0.027233036235,0.0259012691677,0.01812203601,0.0157681554556,0.0112097561359,0.0111091500148,0.0105840396136,0.0101302023977,0.0101151093841,0.00902756117284,0.00847368035465,0.00840525235981,0.00814912468195,0.00790288578719,0.00767712853849,0.00754006113857,0.00741023011506,0.00739250378683,0.00737163703889,0.00735463155434,0.00722780125216,0.00718721887097,0.00669602490962,0.00652414700016,0.00642991950735,0.00621607480571,0.00570371607319,0.00558629678562,0.00543039385229,0.00524025037885,0.0052104499191,0.00520475208759,0.00422328617424,0.00420774333179,0.00405674381182,0.00394095573574,0.00394095573574,0.00344790983945,0.00344790983945,0.00344790983945,0.00314813409932,0.00219149258919,0.00155601231381"

She was very warm and welcoming.Atmosphere- decent decor, confortable to stay for a while and located in a great part of town.Food- was horrible I expect a lasagne restaurant to have the best. The pasta was ok But the sauce wasnt made with love probably canned. The meatballs weren't made in house they seemed frozen and had an off texture.the cheese seemed microwaved not broiled/In the oven.I ordered the chicken parmesan, pasta wasnt fresh maybe precooked or bad quality. The chicken tasted frozen and was chewy and dry.Besides the food the place had a minor incident where the bar caught on fire and i was worried. Luckily the kitchen staff was able to get things under control.Maybe I came on a off day, maybe this is what the regulars consider good food but i am extremely disappointed.

It is not extremely loud which is nice when you are trying to catch up with friends/family. ServiceThey aren't overly attentive which in my point is great. There when you need something but not annoying. The waiter we had allowed me to change my unlimited brunch option to regular since I realized I actually only be sticking to one drink; he also gave me the second drunk on the house. However, the other employee brought out a bloody mary opposed to a screwdriver while rushing to close up. They changed it quickly without an issue. PricesGreat prices for brunch. Its $17 and they have a nice selection from french toast, eggs, pancakes, and of course lasagna. Unlimited drinks is only $11 extra. Food/DrinksFor brunch I'm more of a Bellini girl and this place knows how to make them! Ive had difficulty finding a good spot. I ordered the french toast and it was very good.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,3050,"Came here for brunch last Saturday with two of my favorite ladies. I found this place randomly after chatting with Ingrid S. for like 2 hours while we both executed a search for a brunch place that was reasonably priced, a good bang for our buck but also with tasty food, good service and a cool vibe - oh, and another caveat was that that it had to be a place that none of us had ever been to. This was actually a bit of a challenge, but enter Lasagna Restaurant.So there are actually 2 locations in Manhattan. Being that we were planning this on a Friday afternoon, I wanted to get a quick reservation in and so Lasagna in Chelsea it was. 1:30 reservation seamlessly confirmed via Open Table? Dunno.The following morning the restaurant called me like 3 or 4 times to confirm. I wasn't up at 11am, lol. I returned their call and they were super nice in saying there was a 15 minute grace period in which they would hold our table in the event that we're late. Coming from Queens? On a weekend? At the mercy of the MTA? Sweet, I knew deep down in my heart that I would be taking advantage of this...lol.After I arrived 15 minutes late (lol) Ingrid S., Anna F. and I were seated...conveniently right next to the bar. Smart. We were given water, menus and once we made it clear that we were there to drink (drink, drink, drink, drink) they took our requests and in the blink of an eye there were 2 bellinis, 1 mimosa and a coffee in front of us (I ordered a bellini and a coffee because my innards were requesting caffeine). In all we had about 3 cocktails each before we even ordered our food. Throughout the course of our brunch we also never sat with an empty glass for more than like 2 minutes. I was impressed.Their brunch all inclusively comes out to $25 (before tax and tip) and is broken down as $15.95 for a brunch entree and an extra $9 is you'd like unlimited draaaaaanks. Your drank options are: Mimosas, Bellinis, Screwdrivers or Bloody Mary, Coffee or Tea. I consumed only 1 coffee and a bajillion bellinis. I regret not trying a screwdriver and will make sure I have at least one when I return, haha!Okay, so FOOD. I ordered their Smoked Salmon Scramble which was like 3 scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and spinach (was supposed to also come with onions, but I asked them to leave those suckers out). My eggs were very nicely scrambled, flavorful and the smoked shrimp chunks were really delicious. I also came served with rosemary, thyme oven baked potatoes. Also yummy and a nice, generous portion too. Wins all around for me here!Ingrid S. ordered their Shrimp & Scallop Frittata which they describe as being an open faced omelette with shrimps, scallops, fresh tomatoes ( I would certainly hope so, lol) and scallions. This dish was also described on the menu as being ""spicy"" which is why I didn't get it. Though I tried a piece of one of her scallops and it was pretty good. Anna F. ordered their Cinnamon Brioche French Toast which came topped with Cinnamon, Apples and Roasted Walnuts...I thought the walnuts tasted like almonds, haha! I sampled her French Toast and it was pretty good. Crispy exterior, light and fluffy towards the center. Not bad, not bad at all.Our meals also came with complmentary garlic butter (maybe light pesto?) bread. We shared about 2 baskets and they were delicious, served warm and went perfect with my eggs dish. I haven't picked out a brunch place that's been this successful since I found Scottadito Osteria Toscana in Brooklyn via Yelp (and now it seems to have become popular)..but Manhattan is an easier borough to gather people together in and Lasagna Chelsea (such a hidden gem!) might be my new go-to Manhattan brunch spot. Shout out to Juan for being our amazingly friendly and efficient waiter, shout out to the bartender for being awesome and shoutout to whoever was playing N*Sync, Spice Girls, Aaliyah and other fantastic 90s jams during brunch. 5 Yelpy Yelp Stars!We will most definitely be back!! ...and I also really want to try their namesake Lasagna because I saw some Lasagna orders come out of the kitchen and they looked BANGIN'!",5.0 star rating,"Astoria, Queens, NY",5,0,0.300000011921,18.6000003815,"brunch,brunch place,caveat,Anna F.,two,ladies,reservation,place,none,place,food,Wins,bang,bit,Smoked Salmon Scramble,vibe,service,buck,search,challenge,Ingrid S.,event,locations,Manhattan,Lasagna Restaurant.So,table,brunch place,Yelpy Yelp Stars,suckers,Open Table,reservation,restaurant,innards,Cinnamon Brioche French Toast,brunch,brunch,Shrimp,times,mercy,bellini,coffee,coffee,bellinis,drink,Bellinis,Coffee,coffee,food,bajillion bellinis,advantage,FOOD,eggs,eggs,menus,mimosa,all,Screwdrivers,namesake Lasagna,requests,screwdriver,salmon,Mimosas,draaaaaanks,Lasagna Chelsea,heart,bar,lol.,front,blink,eye,cocktails,course,glass,tax,tip,brunch entree,Tea,call,drank options,spinach,onions,rosemary,potatoes,portion,Dunno.,Queens,MTA,baskets,borough,light,eggs dish,brunch,meals,water,center,exterior,pesto,garlic butter,bread,people,Lasagna orders,Bloody Mary,Yelp,caffeine,brunch spot,gem,shoutout,bartender,waiter,jams,kitchen,French Toast,scallops,scallions,scallops,Osteria Toscana,Scottadito,Brooklyn,Sweet,shrimp chunks,shrimps,dish,menu,one,Walnuts,walnuts,BANGIN,omelette,tomatoes,Apples,almonds,piece,Spice Girls,Aaliyah,Juan,Scallop Frittata,N*Sync","7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,1,4,2,2,7,7,7,3,6,7,7,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,6,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,3,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,1,1,7,2,3,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,5,1,1,1,7,3","0.0538606159389,0.0537455491722,0.0505850538611,0.0397730469704,0.0329226627946,0.0329226627946,0.0265535116196,0.0259467642754,0.0247236769646,0.0211983174086,0.0196993816644,0.0184208955616,0.0179217141122,0.0166230462492,0.0163124464452,0.015684414655,0.015684414655,0.015684414655,0.015684414655,0.0156041625887,0.0150547781959,0.014989649877,0.0146475564688,0.0144198173657,0.0138681111857,0.00959195382893,0.00919227581471,0.00771820312366,0.00712143070996,0.00676748761907,0.00676748761907,0.00675186887383,0.00655048061162,0.00653317058459,0.00646573211998,0.00646076630801,0.00616756547242,0.00590742612258,0.00586221460253,0.00533615238965,0.00533615238965,0.00533615238965,0.00533615238965,0.00533615238965,0.00531917996705,0.00531917996705,0.00531553570181,0.0049534458667,0.0048641692847,0.00466108461842,0.00451629795134,0.0045135053806,0.00451084412634,0.00450925715268,0.00450925715268,0.00450531486422,0.00449491292238,0.00440066959709,0.00436624279246,0.00410768436268,0.00410514418036,0.00404334347695,0.0040364577435,0.00401799893007,0.00395280309021,0.00395280309021,0.00395280309021,0.00394508475438,0.00394508475438,0.00394508475438,0.00394163513556,0.00393841089681,0.00393841089681,0.0039353845641,0.0039353845641,0.0039353845641,0.00393253332004,0.00392311718315,0.00369095220231,0.00359149742872,0.00359149742872,0.00358735676855,0.00358735676855,0.00358542124741,0.00349722150713,0.00347928632982,0.00347044412047,0.00338599109091,0.00326641672291,0.00305282301269,0.00304913544096,0.00303005753085,0.00295474566519,0.00280129956082,0.0026707793586,0.0026707793586,0.00266966898926,0.00266966898926,0.002668594243,0.00266654323786,0.00246936478652,0.00232772273012,0.00198356248438,0.00193918042351,0.00184588169213,0.00184588169213,0.00184520310722,0.00184520310722,0.00184520310722,0.00184520310722,0.00184454384726,0.00180766452104,0.00158788147382,0.00158788147382,0.00158633198589,0.0015782113187,0.0015782113187,0.0015782113187,0.00155913748313,0.00155408983119,0.00147521519102,0.00134100753348,0.00134100753348,0.00134036573581,0.00133974745404,0.00133974745404,0.00124784372747,0.00117372442037,0.00117372442037,0.00117203814443,0.00117203814443,0.0011287907837,0.00109202682506,0.00109202682506,0.00109202682506,0.000694596848916,0.00052986619994"
Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,37242,"I was impressed with Lasagna brunch but not overwhelmingly so. I made a reservation for 15 a couple of weeks in advance, and they were super friendly even when I kept calling back to change the time/date. It's not a huge place, so I wouldn't really try to go for groups bigger than 10. A couple people dropped out of our res (disappointing) but they were still able to accommodate the change and switched our seat to one towards the door. It was a little cramped and cold (we went on a dreary winter day), but the wait staff was attentive and kept filling our drinks. They weren't as friendly as I was expecting from all the reviews and from recommendations from friends, but I think it was just an overwhelmingly busy day. Basically the deal is you get a lunch item plus ONE drink for $15.95, and if you want to do all you can drink, you add $9. Most of us did the all you can drink, and the favorite drinks were mimosas, bellinis, and the bloody marys. The screwdrivers are REALLY strong, just warning you it basically tastes like straight vodka, but if that's what you're going for then absolutely no judgement. The staff was really nice about letting us drink longer because of the confusion with the tables. The food was good quality but not AMAZING. I got the eggs benedict, but the favorites were steak & eggs and even some pasta dishes. The real winner was the bread baskets. HUGE plus with the garlic and pesto sauce. All and all, I recommend but with a smaller crowd.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,194909,"Came here for bottomless brunch. Had a great experience the first time , bartender kept up with the drinks. So this time thought it was going to be the same experience. Wanted to do bottomless brunch again , but didn't realize they closed at 4. Waiter didn't say anything.  Only gave us 2 mimosas for the bottomless brunch price. Food became mediocre. Waste of time and money.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,6718,I came here for lunch and actually placed an order before hand to pick up and eat there. I had their bolognese lasagna with their caesar salad. The place was fairly empty for prime lunch hour. There were only around 2/3 tables that had people in them. I overheard some of the other people come here because they saw them on food network. I came here because of this food app that gave credit to use here. The caesar salad was pretty basic I was looking forward to the lasagna more. When it came out it was very cheesy but also very oily. I ended up eating about half of it. It was a pretty good portion with the salad to fill you up. It was also a pretty good lunch deal.

When my friend arrived we got seated right away, and later was brought a bread basket (YUM). We ordered the unlimited mimosas and was pleased that the waiters will occasionally come around and top us off which was good, my glass was never empty. I checked into YELP when we got seated, and apparently when you check in, you get a free glass of wine, so I showed it to our waiter and he was a little hesitant to give me the wine (ODD). Ones he brought out our food I asked him about the wine again and he said according to his manager, those are only reserved for non brunch hours (RIDICULOUS in my opinion). there's no disclaimer when I checked in so I should have gotten my wine.Nonetheless, I saved my free wine voucher for the next time I go in (non brunch hours).

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,194820,"WORST SERVICE. The old blonde hostess was the rudest women I have ever met. I made a reservation a week in advance for 15 people with no issue. I called the day before to confirm my reservation and they had written down a table for 18 instead of 15 which was incorrect. Also, I confirmed my cell phone number with them. The day of the reservation there was a parade in the city so I was running late. I called and spoke to the hostess to let them know I was late but my party was there, still no issue.  THEN I get I call from my friend saying they only have a table for 8 people. Now you can see there is an issue because 8 is not the number I confirmed multiple times. So I call the hostess back and asked what was going on. This women lies to me and says she tried calling me last night to explain there was no way they can fit 15 people at one table and she claims that the number was incorrect and my phone was not working. I received NO calls from the restaurant and my phone number was correct because I confirmed it the day before. ALSO, I get work calls all day so I find it hard to believe that when they ""called"" my phone suddenly stopped working. Obviously I had a huge issue with this but the hostess tells me she will figure it out. My friends call me back and tell me they were being seated at an appropriate table for the number of people I made and confirmed the reservation for.  But the drama does not end there. When I arrive the hostess immediately jumped down my throat and was yelling at me for being late like I was a child! I could not believe this women's behavior. I felt like I was being verbally assaulted. So I walked away from her and headed to my table but she proceeded to follow me through the restaurant continuing to yell like a lunatic. It was so insane my party and I decided to leave. Then this women starts claiming to be the manager and THEN claims to be the owner of the restaurant. I find that hard to believe because of her lack of professionalism. Then she starts threatening to write a bad review about us, the costumer.  Her behavior was absolutely insane and caused me to leave the restaurant before even sitting down.

It's in the same room! Isn't that something you should tell people when we order them? I mean we are there for brunch like everyone else! The more frustrating thing is the girl looked clueless... which she probably is. Lets get to the good stuff... =) The waitress we got in the dining room was awesome. Attentive and super friendly. Much different from that awful bartender woman. I ordered the salmon scramble which was soooo good! I think it was like 12 bucks... Cheap and delicious! Whats better than that... I know... all you can drink mimosas!! The waitress kept the glasses full too! Brunch ended up being pretty good. Got to catch up with friends and got a little tipsy on a sunday funday. If it wasn't for the awful bar service, This would be a 4 star for sure. My only advice, skip the bar. If theres a wait, go somewhere else until your party arrives..",2.0 star rating,"Boston, MA",2,1,0.0,16.2999992371,"brunch,reservation,place,bar,drinks,party,host,problem,star,friend,mimosas,girl,Brunch,mimosas,bartenders,mimosa,other,attention,people,woman bartender,restaurant computer,bartenders attention,Lets,something,party,dining room,bar pricing,room,glasses,brunch,service,something,bucks,thing,inconvenience,bill,bar,mimosas,everyone,salmon scramble,Facebook,glasses,friends,waitress,Whats,all,wait,party,bar service,funday,advice,somewhere,waitress,dining room,bartender woman,stuff","4,7,7,2,7,3,1,7,1,1,7,1,4,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,6,7,3,7,3,2,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,2,1,2,1,7","0.0941170305014,0.075188010931,0.0646018609405,0.0483380146325,0.0460713803768,0.0451699011028,0.0360077060759,0.0360077060759,0.0336115732789,0.0331948921084,0.0313976481557,0.0245640594512,0.0229793544859,0.0185465887189,0.0184272360057,0.018384821713,0.0162377078086,0.0159778948873,0.0150300869718,0.0136400163174,0.0136025464162,0.0134976170957,0.0121232215315,0.0117790419608,0.0114540979266,0.0114299030975,0.0111410906538,0.010450815782,0.0104458024725,0.0104331625625,0.0104318782687,0.0104192970321,0.0103972833604,0.0101616783068,0.00915411673486,0.00911727268249,0.00842739921063,0.00833988841623,0.00830425415188,0.00825045630336,0.00805869698524,0.00704501708969,0.00703864172101,0.00699873128906,0.00617010844871,0.0061670425348,0.00535193271935,0.00535193271935,0.00487182894722,0.00426422944292,0.00426062569022,0.00425891112536,0.00407629506662,0.00341331795789,0.00310052605346,0.00271785072982"
Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,194815,"A friend and I came here for brunch this Sunday. The lasagna was great, however the service was terrible from one particular woman refilling the mimosas. To begin, our bottomless brunch was cut off 15-20 minutes early on top of waiting some time for the refills in the first place, however we chose not to bring it up to the woman serving the drinks. After paying the bill, we left our tip however continued a conversation. The woman who was originally serving the mimosas was smoking a cigarette, came to our table with the cigarette in hand to take her tip. After seeing the tip (cash portion) she came back to the table, in a rude tone asking if we were displeased with the service because she thought we had left less than 10%. After saying no she slammed the check book and walked away. Completely surprised by this terrible service my friend and I recalculated the 18% tip we had left after having our bottomless cut off early. The woman then came back after realizing the rest of the tip had been left on the card to ""apologize,"" and when I asked to speak to a manager she said i could speak to her, when i ask again she claimed the manager was not in yet.On the other hand, there is a waiter named Benny who was very friendly, professional, and helpful.

The Italian frittata was good and had a nice spiciness to it. A friend had steak and eggs and looked pretty good. As for the drinks, it's a good concept as you can change between bottomless options. But there's very little alcohol in them. Mimosas had a hint of champagne but was mainly juice. Bloody Mary was spicy and tasted more like liquid cocktail dipping sauce.

It was SO delicious it left me wanting more. Lasagna was always lasagna to me and I always had a take it or leave it attitude when it came to eating lasagna. Well after eating my Lobster Lasagna my attitude is definitely TAKE IT. The bits of lobster really brightened up the dish and the amount of lobster was generous. When restaurants add lobster or shrimp or any other kind of seafood to their entrees they usually add three pieces and that's it. Not the case with this restaurant.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,5596,"Came here after having a horrible experience at the Rocking Horse (read my review update below for more on that).All I can say is, this lasagna pwns that asshole manager at the Rocking Horse. Even his rude physical prowess and extended arms designed for shoving peoples' girlfriends would NEVER match up to the awesome power of al dente pasta stuffed with mighty ricotta cheese and the positively HUGE dish it was served in. In fact, I could use that dish on said manager and inflict maximum damage no problem. I'd eat the lasagna first though. Don't be silly.In all seriousness, the lasagna and cosmo special combined with the *awesome* concert we went to at Webster Hall more than made up for it.

After another 20 minutes they brought out everyone's meal but mine. Another 10 minutes passed before a DIFFERENT waitress brought mine out. And the icing on the cake? My eggs Benedict was freezing cold. Another person in our party also received a cold burger. The waitress kept blaming the kitchen for the mistakes but I witnessed her slam 5 screw drivers while we were there (not to mention she was probably drinking before we got there). After complaining to the manager, she was very nice and gave us 2 rounds of free shots and 30% off our bill. Then, when our checks were brought out they were all wrong without the 30% discount. A second check was brought our for everyone, also wrong. The third check was the charm and after 2 and a half hours we finally got the hell out of there. Do not go here.

The ambience is casual with a busy bar area serving happy hour cocktails in addition to the restaurant floor, so a table near the bar could be happy with a rowdy local crowd in boozing it up. Wait staff are friendly and efficient. The groupon deal for two is good value with a shared appetizer and individual choice of soup/salad and Lasagna entree. Food is pretty standard fare. My Calamari starter was fairly nice, Minestrone soup inoffensive. The Lasagna, which this restaurant clearly prides itself upon was clearly cooked fresh (nice) but I think there are too many variations that don't lend themselves to Lasagna (whoever heard of salmon Lasagna?).

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,20790,"Friends and I met at Lasagna for a Saturday brunch, which offers a number of selections plus one alcoholic beverage for $15.95. Add $9.00 for unlimited drinks. CASH ONLY.Upon arrival, we were seated and the server immediately spilled water all over two of our friends. Not a huge deal and it was cleaned up, but this was the start to a tedious meal. For a place called Lasagna, there are ZERO pasta dishes on the brunch menu. I've seen other places that have an egg scramble pasta dish and lots of places have lunch items. They do have a hamburger...but no pasta. But because their regular menu is also available, I asked if I could do a regular entrée and the unlimited drinks. The answer was no, but they said they could do a Veggie Lasagna, Meat Lasagna or Penne Vodka as part of brunch. I opted for the Meat Lasagna. It was very yummy, though the portion was smaller than I would have liked. All of my friends went for the unlimited drinks, but because the entire restaurant had just one waiter that morning, we were constantly in need of refreshments, condiments and other things. I don't blame the waiter at all, as we was doing the best he could.

We were a little surprised that no attempt was made to accomodate our 9 year old with, perhaps a half portion, or something less cumbersome.) Furthermore, we asked fora recommendation between two lasagnas, and she said that she preferred the chicken parm over everything.  It seemed weird to us that she wouldn't recommend the signature meal of the restaurant.  When the food arrived, the wrong plate was brought to one of our party by another server from the kitchen.  When we insisted that it was the wrong dish, it felt a little like they wanted us to take the wrong meal.  However, the correct plate was brought and we were able to enjoy our meal.  The waitress made only one stop to top up the wine, and didn't ask us how our food was. She appeared later to slap down the dessert menu without a word.  All in all, the food was excellent.  The garlic bread was, however, cold and a bit bland.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,65916,"We came here for an early dinner- it had been some time since we have dined here as it was a favorite of me and the SO's when we used to live in North Jersey and would drive into the city on a whim for dinner. We were both starving and knew that we would get our fill for not too much here. We were the second group in the restaurant and sat wherever. The staff is made up (mostly) attractive young men and are very friendly and attentive. There were a couple of regulars at the bar that they were chatting up and the place just has a nice neighborhood feel to it. SO and I got the mussels appetizer special to start (in white wine, parsley, and garlic) and were served garlic bread as well. We put in our order for our food- SO got the tortellini and I got (so I thought) the eggplant lasagna. Our food arrived, and it took me a while to realize that I received the eggplant parmagiana instead of the lasagna. Now I think what happened was that I was so tired and hungry (it had been a long day) and I think I was thinking I'd like eggplant parm, and SO also believes I said parm meaning the lasagna- anyway, no matter what happened the parm was so good and filling (it's an appetizer portion) that I didn't miss the lasgana pasta at all (and probably all better for  my diet anyway!)

Also, we were there drinking for well over 2 hours, but we were never rushed out; our waitress let us take our time.The second time I went was on Valentine's Day, and the service wasn't as good, though it was understandable since they were extremely busy. Our meals came out cold, we initially weren't given garlic bread, and we had to ask for refills a couple of times, but our waitress was very sweet, apologetic, and accommodating, making her easily forgivable. I'm not sure if it was because it was of the subpar service we received, or if they were trying to promote their Facebook page, but our waitress gave us two free Fireball shots after liking the page.

It's across from a hostel, so I guess it make sense.  The hostess was extremely perky, and the waitor and busboy seemed just as friendly, but not with the same perkiness. Not too expensive for Manhattan prices.. $12 for a cheese lasgana,  5.75 for dessert. The lasagna took awhile to make - but they make it to order. It tasted just like homemade lasagna. the top was loaded with cheese, I just wish the filling had just as much.  It was kinda hard to cut the lasagna and eat it from the small personal casserole-type dish it was served (and cooked) in.

I've been here twice with friends, and we all loved our meal. Both times, we came here for dinner, at 7:00 on a Monday. The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was quiet enough to enjoy good conversation. We all got lasagna, of course! This last time, I got a wheat lasagna with a crab filling and a pink sauce, which was excellent. I was afraid that the crab would be too harsh, but it was subtle. The waitress asked me what kind of sauce I'd like on it, because apparently they also serve it with a white sauce. My friend customized her own plate by mixing the four cheese and the mushroom lasagna together. My boyfriend enjoyed the huge chunks of sausage in his dinner. The garlic bread was very good, as was the salad, which four of us shared. Despite being full, we managed to order creme brulee for dessert. The lasagna is cooked to order, which does mean you have to wait a little while for your meal. However, I don't believe we waited any longer than the time it took the lasagna to bake. Other reviewers said they waited forever for their meal, but this was not the case for us. Perhaps Monday at 7 is the optimum time to come. The portions are pretty huge, and you may end up with leftovers. This is a good thing.

It is an extra $11 for screwdrivers, mimosas, etc. Name me a place that is cheaper (please because I really want to know for future reference). The entrees were also very good for the wallet. Great garlic bread too.Cons: The drinks were cheap, but they were also week. Not only were they lacking in alcohol content, the waiters were slow to refill. I got the salmon eggs benedict, and found it completely average, if not slightly mediocre. The sauce wasn't that strong, the piece of salmon was small, and the bread was cold. Maybe it was just my dish though, because they got different dishes, and most of them enjoyed it. Overall, I don't think I'll be back.

The portions were HUGE, so you get what you pay for in terms of price, but there was no way either of us could even eat half of it.  Since we were headed to a game, there was no way we could take leftovers with us, so it felt wasteful.  I wish they would offer half portions.  I would say the lasagna was ""good"", but not really the best I ever had, either.  I would suggest going with someone and sharing one dish, but in this case, my son and I wanted to each order something different, so we spent nearly $60 on food we could barely eat.  The service was fine...not the friendliest, but attentive.

I've tried the lunch specials and was less than impressed: they consist of a sub-set of menu items graced by a perfunctory iceberg-lettuce-'n'-grated-carrot salad. Stick with the titanic lasagnas instead.Sometimes, on a whim, they'll throw in about three pounds of free bread with your order, which is quite handy as it allows you to live on French toast for the remainder of the week.UPDATE 5/26/08: I just checked delivery.com and Lasagna Ristorante has upped their minimum delivery order from $20 to $50. $50?

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,22909,"Lasagna is one of my favorite stand-by restaurants in Manhattan. Their specialty is bubbly, hot, baked in it's own dish lasagna. The original is great, and less than $12. My favorite is a combination of the artichoke and caper lasagna in pink sauce, but I've taken to adding goat cheese to it, and damn, it's delicious. The vegetable primavera version is also great - lots of julianned veggies, and you can really enjoy the marinara thats used in everything, and totally on point. I also love the gnocchi or penne a la vodka. mmmmm... gnocchi a la vodka... The extensive Italian menu spans four pages, so I bet you can find a favorite (or six) here. Good, plentiful salads aren't the most incredible, but they are tasty. Some appetizers are more frozen-and-fried (mozzarella sticks) than I like to pay for when out, but the calimari is always good, and the mussels fra diavlo is usually very good too. The simple garlic bread served to each table more than makes up for any inconsistency in my book. Lasagna does a brisk pick up and delivery business, and the lunch specials are a great deal, starting at $7.95 for salad, soda, lasagna or other pasta. I discovered their brunch a while back, and if I wasn't so lazy in the mornings I'd have made the trek back because it's inexpensive, delicious and Justin makes a mean bloody mary mix. The wine list has been improved over the year, and new happy hour specials help with usually slightly higher than normal bar prices. Personally I like a more lounge-y feel (the somewhat utilitarian tables are quite smushed together) but the dozen seats at the bar and some of the tables in the window bays are nice enough to make an evening out of it. The service is casual, fun, (mostly) professional, attractive (I'm looking at you Craig) and I happen to love quite a few of the people who work here. You should go.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,194816,So I've been here twice already but just forgot to review. The five stars are for over all experience. The food here is good enough but this is the spot to go to if you're trying to get your drunk at brunch. It's usually not too busy the drinks are strong and it's reasonably priced with out being pretentious. It's kinda like one of those spots you go to when you don't want anything fancy but just want to get drunk and have some food. The service both times was great. The people are nice and they keep on refilling you. The price is totally reasonable. And best part is that it's not crowded and there's no time limit. I've been to my fair share of brunches in the city that are soooo much more expensive and the drinks suck along with the food. Even though this place isn't super fancy it is deff a good casual boozy brunch.,5.0 star rating,"New Brunswick, NJ",1,1,0.40000000596,5.90000009537,"food,experience,stars,spot,brunches,drunk,brunch,people,food,spots,service,drinks,times,anything,one,drinks,share,city,food,brunch,place,price,part,time limit","7,7,7,2,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,6,4,7,1,6,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7","0.190137907863,0.105810284615,0.0994223579764,0.0574250631034,0.055357914418,0.0522335655987,0.0509506687522,0.0484123304486,0.0313669331372,0.0311776418239,0.0297462139279,0.0293537005782,0.0284758098423,0.0272931903601,0.0272931903601,0.0211587268859,0.0185183491558,0.0185183491558,0.01611732319,0.0160978995264,0.0156913157552,0.00998791866004,0.00997302960604,0.00948031432927"

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,195106,"Came here with a large group. Great atmosphere and wine is fairly priced. Okay, let's get right to it. I only had one of these, but do not get the scallops. That had to be the worst scallop I've ever had. That being said, the other food is alright. Combination Platter (3/5): The mozzarella sticks are good, but nothing special. The calamari was quite good and the eggplant parm was not very eggplant-y. So overall, not the most delicious (given how fried everything is), but still serviceable as a starter for 4-5 people. -- $16Sausage and Onion Lasagna (2/5): There is a lot of cheese and yes it is good but the dish is mostly that. The actual pasta is also a little bit too soft... the entire dish sort of just breaks down. You could barely taste the sausage and onion, everything was overwhelmed by the cheese. Although, truthfully, that might be just because there was so little sausage. And it wasn't even great sausage. All this being said, it is filling. Still, I would probably get something else next time. -- $19Experience (4/5): Pretty fun atmosphere. We sat a bit crowded, but the wait staff helped to make it work.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,25885,"I usually steer clear of ordering lasagna at any restaurant because you can't really get a decent lasagna that isn't home cooked. So if you are going to eat lasagna outside of home, what better place to go than a restaurant that specializes in it, right?Seems like there are a lot of places that specialize in certain comfort foods so it would make sense that there would be places that specialize in Italian comfort foods. It works for The Meatball Shop on the LES, so why not here? Well....it works to an extent but the end product is just pretty average. It's not so much an Italian grandmother serving you a lasagna as it is a dude wearing a tank top when it's 50 degrees outside. Yes, this is Chelsea alright. Side note: A friend of mine once got kicked out of an authentic Italian restuarant for attempting to dine there while wearing a wife beater. It was disrespectful. So this waiter can get away with it because it's Chelsea? It didn't help any that the tank top said the name of the restaurant on it. The point I'm trying to make is that I wouldn't consider this an authentic Italian restaurant. It was refreshing to see a variety of lasagnas on the menu, both meat and vegetable types. I decided to stick with the standard meat lasagna. They called it the ground ""sirloin"" lasagna. Only the best. Well, the sirloin tasted pretty much like ground beef you would find in any lasagna. Nothing special. It came served in a dish rather than a plate. That told me it was probably cut out from a full sheet of lasagna on a tray, cheese and sauce thrown on it, then shoved into a broiler to melt the cheese on top. A lot of times lasagna comes pre-made and has to be reheated at restaurants, which is one of the reasons why I never order it. Guess it was too much for me to hope that an old granny was back in the kitchen whipping out piping hot, fresh lasagnas. Authentic or not, it doesn't seem to stop people from going here. The place was packed. Thankfully, they take reservations. It's not exactly the most quiet place and the table seating here is pretty tight. Maybe I need to come back here for their more unique lasagnas because the regular just didn't seem to do it for me.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,10.1999998093,"lasagna,lasagna,restaurant,lot,restaurant,Italian,lasagna,tank top,places,lasagna,places,place,home,restaurants,name,lasagna,average,wife beater,product,restaurant,comfort foods,comfort foods,lasagnas,meat lasagna,lasagna,restuarant,restaurant,extent,waiter,Chelsea,lasagnas,dude,point,meat,degrees,sense,tank top,grandmother,ground,sirloin,sirloin,mine,friend,Side note,variety,granny,menu,vegetable,types,best,ground beef,LES,The Meatball Shop,lasagnas,one,tray,reasons,kitchen,people,place,table seating,lasagna,times lasagna,reservations,place,regular,lot,top,cheese,cheese,Nothing,plate,dish,broiler,sauce,sheet","7,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,6,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7","0.215401679277,0.0687695890665,0.0679355859756,0.0563501156867,0.0562922470272,0.0448872558773,0.0330324172974,0.0311169456691,0.0305199809372,0.0276644788682,0.0249564535916,0.022057140246,0.017899626866,0.0144559759647,0.011532551609,0.0111772650853,0.00841776933521,0.00835836492479,0.00831191055477,0.00785772688687,0.00782546959817,0.00782546959817,0.00766207603738,0.00765431672335,0.00763422483578,0.00687550473958,0.0068445247598,0.00678794831038,0.00663407100365,0.00577757041901,0.0056857415475,0.00559772085398,0.00554209435359,0.00553752016276,0.00532115949318,0.00531551986933,0.00527609977871,0.0052237873897,0.0047185192816,0.0047185192816,0.00471054296941,0.00455123092979,0.00455123092979,0.00455123092979,0.00429685367271,0.004188392777,0.00413656933233,0.00413656933233,0.00413656933233,0.0041248886846,0.00412151636556,0.00403487449512,0.00403487449512,0.00392681220546,0.0038089544978,0.0034354289528,0.0030706084799,0.00306870997883,0.0030669006519,0.0030450548511,0.00259668962099,0.00249791610986,0.00249629211612,0.00246955943294,0.00233574933372,0.00222907844,0.00206066016108,0.00169360090513,0.00154032779392,0.00154032779392,0.00134945195168,0.00134847394656,0.00134847394656,0.00134754949249,0.00134754949249,0.00134754949249"
Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,195107,"I am writing Lasagna to genuinely thank them for excellent service and food.  This weekend I was entertaining a handful of family members visiting NY who varied in age from10 to 50, including one very precocious and particular teenager and one legit/earned her stripes former New Yorker who spent the 80's living and loving grimy, ungentrified NYC.  I knew the food here to be solid from past visits, but I didn't expect there to be much of a problem getting a table on a Sunday at noon.  I was shocked when I arrived, within minutes of the restaurant opening, to learn that they were fully booked for brunch.  I wanted to go to here primarily because I thought that the kids in our group would easy to please with the simple, but varied fare (plus, I personally think their lasagna is the best I've ever had).  The restaurant host (whose name I regretfully forget) kindly explained to me that they were packed for brunch (and I believed him - there was a line out the door waiting for the place to open) and that there was no way they could seat our party of 6.  Once I told him our circumstances (and promised to eat quickly and vacate our table in a timely, but reasonable manner) this kind and gracious man hooked us up.Our 10 year old couldn't get enough of the garlic bread, going so far as to sneak the entire basket off the table while her mom wasn't looking after repeatedly being told that she could not have any more lest she ruin her appetite.  Our picky (and precious) teenager who ""does NOT eat pasta"" overcame her aversion to gluten to try the ""fancy"" prosciutto lasagna and promptly devoured her entire dish within minutes. Meanwhile, my cousin who was deciding between chicken parm and lasagna went for the parm (against my advice) but was grateful that her daughter filled up on garlic bread because she got to bogart most of her munchkin's Four Cheese lasagna which she deemed ""out of this world"".  Now, I know that Lasagna isn't Bagatelle, Morandi or whatever brunch place is hot this week, but my family has a really fantastic experience thanks to our gracious host and delicious food.  Three cheers (and five stars) for Lasagna.",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,6.59999990463,"Lasagna,New Yorker,food,service,lasagna,teenager,kids,restaurant host,stripes,handful,age,family members,cousin,daughter,NYC,teenager,food,table,much,living,problem,visits,restaurant opening,mom,most,brunch,brunch,line,way,table,place,Cheese lasagna,lasagna,garlic bread,fare,group,name,party,door,kind,manner,man,basket,prosciutto lasagna,garlic bread,chicken parm,parm,circumstances,dish,munchkin,advice,brunch place,family,food,host,cheers,world,experience,stars,table,Bagatelle,appetite,gluten,aversion,pasta,Morandi","7,1,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,1,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,3,7,3,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1","0.129704743624,0.0809740945697,0.069944947958,0.05582819134,0.0548576787114,0.0378628522158,0.0307826716453,0.027044698596,0.026687534526,0.026687534526,0.026687534526,0.026687534526,0.0249730255455,0.0221150293946,0.0206424221396,0.0179398152977,0.0164361726493,0.0127628808841,0.012440526858,0.0102122444659,0.0101599590853,0.0101599590853,0.0101230237633,0.00962935667485,0.00869543477893,0.00858899205923,0.00854500103742,0.00812064856291,0.00812064856291,0.00780477561057,0.00777265476063,0.00730451475829,0.00730451475829,0.00709922704846,0.00681669032201,0.00681669032201,0.00680096261203,0.00680096261203,0.00680096261203,0.00621160399169,0.00621160399169,0.00621160399169,0.00597990583628,0.005329254549,0.00528758671135,0.00528758671135,0.00528758671135,0.00482087489218,0.00463314866647,0.00462623685598,0.00462623685598,0.00447833817452,0.00436622835696,0.0040198424831,0.00365616590716,0.00365175050683,0.00320299528539,0.00319871911779,0.00319485575892,0.00255818222649,0.00234893057495,0.00203549070284,0.00203204643913,0.00203204643913,0.00203204643913,0.00189335586037"

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,20967,"This is a traditional Italian restaurant.  Plating is not top of the line but flavors are.  Cannot give them  5 stars because of the plating and the dated decor.  Prices are not outrageous, I give them that. Service is really good. Staff is kind and very well trained.  Had the angel hair pasta with mushrooms.  I admit that, when served, it was not attractive at all. However, when I tried the sauce... creamy and light tomato sauce, mushrooms cooked just right --not raw and not overcooked nor mushy-- bright green fresh peas, just enough to add an extra sweetness.  The pasta was perfect. Angel hair is a difficult one, either you get it undercooked or overcooked, they have the right point.  The angel hair can be swirled in your fork and won't break. That is excellency!!!! The place, as I mentioned before, looks a bit dated.  Ceilings could use a coat of paint or two.  China definitely needs to be replaced with more up to date and modern designs.  The ones in use are those old fashioned thick plates from the 60's.  If you do not mind the decor or the plates and plating, go for it.  You will enjoy the food.  Bear in mind that there is a lot of competition on 8th avenue. Chelsea rocks and there are many other joints to choose from.  If you are a die hard Italian foodie... this is your place.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,10.1000003815,"restaurant,Prices,Italian,Plating,plating,plates,decor,foodie,line,Angel hair,Cannot,flavors,stars,place,decor,Service,Staff,angel hair pasta,mushrooms,pasta,angel hair,tomato sauce,excellency,sauce,peas,sweetness,place,plating,plates,point,fork,bit,mushrooms,food,mind,lot,competition,avenue,rocks,joints,Ceilings,coat,paint,designs,use,Chelsea,China","2,7,2,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,2,3","0.264982521534,0.0872564986348,0.0574967451394,0.0541599988937,0.0441434979439,0.0356291420758,0.0352343507111,0.0312896184623,0.0310292523354,0.030689433217,0.0299744084477,0.0291417706758,0.0219874102622,0.0163216628134,0.0155577706173,0.0144110862166,0.0143779572099,0.0133944563568,0.0133944563568,0.0107569936663,0.0090458188206,0.00902387313545,0.00892062671483,0.0086878715083,0.00789722986519,0.00789722986519,0.00780783360824,0.00768730370328,0.00768730370328,0.00720943929628,0.00720150442794,0.00718746846542,0.00666047865525,0.00603823456913,0.00534750754014,0.00453564198688,0.00370336929336,0.00370336929336,0.0037010803353,0.00347384391353,0.00235508312471,0.00235508312471,0.00235508312471,0.0023531569168,0.00235134898685,0.00219125207514,0.00139292771928"

While waiting for my bruschetta a basket of 4 pieces of garlic was placed on my table. 4 pieces of bread toasted and topped with olive oil I think garlic and herbs. You could taste copious amounts of garlic.  The bruschetta was given to me after I just finished one piece of garlic bread. I decided to save one piece of garlic bread for my lasagna. The bruschetta had diced tomatoes herbs and some type of spreadable cheese. After I leisurely ate the bruschetta that was cleared shortly after. I was told my order would be out soon. It was less than 3 minutes from then.  The lasagna was baked in on of those single serve dishes. The top was all brown cheesy goodness.  Underneath that was layers of pasta, ground sirloin, and what I believe was ricotta cheese. After a few bites I wanted some black pepper because I like things spicy. I noticed early on there was only salt shakers on the table. No pepper shakers.  So after I asked the waiter for black pepper and he came by with a pepper mill to offer fresh ground pepper.  When i was about done with the lasagna, I took the rest of my garlic bread to sop up the extra sauce and cheese,Once I finished my dishes were  cleared.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,195601,"Last night, a friend called with a personal crisis and asked that I meet him in the ""Circuit Party of New York"".  Yes...he asked me to meet him in Chelsea.  Land of muscle men, tank tops, and washboard abs (I knew I should have worked out yesterday).We walked down 8th ave, and I spotted this place.  Something was different.  Empty tables, most people dressed appropriately, no muscles bulging...My God?  Why is the restaurant have so few people?  We decided to give it a try.Entering the restaurant, our hostess sat us at a table right next to the window.  Why?  Because this is Chelsea...it's all about watching the eye candy walk by.It was at this point, when I opened my menu, I realized why no self respecting circuit boy had walked into this restaurant.  Carbs.  They are the enemy and they had declared full war in this place!  Every item is a garlic infused carbohydrate packed delight.I looked at my waist, and since my pants were feeling a bit on the loose side, I figured I could handle it...as long as I did it in moderation.  Bring on the feast!Our waiter, a cute guy I honestly think I may have dated in the past (so many men...so little that are memorable), recommended the Four Cheese Lasagna with a pink sauce.  Pink sauce?  Could I be any more gay?...I'll take it.  My friend ordered the Chicken Marsala, which comes with of side of guess what?  Pasta!  Bring on the carbs!  Neither of us will be having boyfriends tonight!Our buss boy brought us 8 pieces of garlic bread.  Eight?  Are you serious?  Do you have any idea how many hours on the treadmill I'm going to need to spend to work off these 6 (mmmm...good) pieces of bread?  Just one of these 4 pieces has to be at least 300 calories! (swallow)...they should warn you before they bring 2 pieces of bread to the table!  What?  Yes, please refill our bread basket.My pants were beginning to feel tight, so I thought it best to loosen my belt.Thankfully, as we were finishing our second basket of bread, the lasagna came out.  Now for those of you who don't know this, it's time I set the record straight.  Ladies and gentlemen:Size matters.Specifically when it comes to lasagna, and the Gorgonzola, ricotta, Parmesan and mozzarella goodness that I was about to eat showed just what kind of size queen I can be.   This lasagna was larger than two of my fists put together.  There was no way possible I was going to eat all of that....but damn it...I was going to try!Somehow I had transformed into a pig (read=pig...not PIGGY!) and this lasagna dish was my trough.  My friend, seeing my dinner, tried to take a fork full taste for himself.  He nearly lost an hand in the process.""MINE"", I growled, as I continued to shovel into my mouth the cheesy bubbly goodness that I am going to be working off in the gym for months.  My fellow gay brethren stared from outside, as I shed all sense of decorum and ate...and ate...and ate.""Don't judge me!"" I thought.  I would have said it, but that would have meant pausing in my eating, and stopping was not an option.  This was the best damn lasagna I'd had in 5 years (granted, it's also the only lasagna I've had in 5 years).  Sadly, I had to stop, as if I ate any more food, I would have been sick.  Not to mention, I think I split the back of my pants open.Thankfully our waiter wrapped up the remaining 2/3, which I will be able to eat for breakfast...and lunch, and dinner today. It was that much food!Now some of you (well any of you who've actually read this far down) may be wondering why I only rated this restaurant 4 stars.  Well, you see, I had dinner last night at 8:00 pm.  It is now 12:30 the next day.  I've brushed my teeth twice, flossed, had several cups of coffee and some sugarless gum.  Yet still I'm tasting garlic 16 hours later!  Enough already.  I need to get on a treadmill.  My waist currently resembles a muffin top.",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan/Upper West Side, New York, NY",4,0,0.0,12.8999996185,"friend,friend,crisis,carbohydrate,restaurant,restaurant,Circuit Party,New York,tables,by.It,Something,men,place,people,muscles,people,Chelsea,waiter,Chicken Marsala,tank tops,Land,washboard abs,lasagna,bit,menu,try.,way,basket.My,God,enemy,restaurant,table,Carbs,pants,pieces,lasagna,lasagna,circuit boy,place,side,waist,back,garlic bread,bread,bread,bread,hostess,window,self,war,delight.,lasagna,pants,pieces,pieces,lasagna dish,carbs,table,one,pieces,men,sauce,Pink sauce,side,Pasta,treadmill,basket,lasagna,Size,goodness,pig,pig,all,breakfast,moderation,feast,boyfriends,Neither,Eight,idea,belt.,two,goodness,record,size queen,gentlemen,mozzarella,Parmesan,ricotta,fists,dinner,pants,Four Cheese Lasagna,food,boy,Ladies,waiter,option,kind,eating,lunch,any,restaurant,sense,dinner,Gorgonzola,some,food,treadmill,waist,stars,teeth,cups,coffee,gum,muffin top,brethren,dinner,taste,gym,mouth,hand,decorum,PIGGY,MINE","1,1,4,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,2,1,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,6,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,6,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,1,7,6,6,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,5","0.157580435276,0.0334839224815,0.0311790108681,0.0284289680421,0.0197586677969,0.0190604571253,0.0184949133545,0.0184949133545,0.0184395499527,0.0183188803494,0.0175747461617,0.0168840456754,0.0168840456754,0.0167753100395,0.0167753100395,0.0167366694659,0.0163672789931,0.0157891996205,0.0153051717207,0.0147760333493,0.0147760333493,0.0147760333493,0.0147585012019,0.0122860949486,0.011457153596,0.0103864008561,0.010301261209,0.0095438817516,0.00869717542082,0.00843267515302,0.00752623518929,0.00701509322971,0.0069834580645,0.00696734245867,0.00665175542235,0.00647759344429,0.00638717319816,0.00636039627716,0.00634424109012,0.00633724918589,0.00633724918589,0.00604733452201,0.00562334945425,0.00561290979385,0.00560672255233,0.00560103729367,0.00558263389394,0.00558263389394,0.00556487822905,0.00555074168369,0.00554462289438,0.00535103725269,0.00522054033354,0.00502374535426,0.00502091506496,0.00477731600404,0.00467940093949,0.00466236565262,0.00443298975006,0.00431001326069,0.00427364511415,0.00427364511415,0.00426963157952,0.00426240917295,0.00425913417712,0.00424523418769,0.00423625251278,0.00398492068052,0.0038728301879,0.0038728301879,0.00386944366619,0.00386944366619,0.00386944366619,0.00381069257855,0.00374273397028,0.00373893720098,0.00372098921798,0.00372098921798,0.00371856987476,0.00371407857165,0.0037062196061,0.00365445762873,0.00344079709612,0.00338980159722,0.00338823860511,0.00338823860511,0.00338823860511,0.00338823860511,0.00338823860511,0.00338673125952,0.00316866207868,0.00316866207868,0.00307929213159,0.00288288784213,0.00283454312012,0.00273115257733,0.00270484178327,0.00268911267631,0.00253103487194,0.0025238818489,0.00252125086263,0.00236026197672,0.00236026197672,0.00228206184693,0.00219211238436,0.00200547277927,0.00199434277602,0.00199434277602,0.00199072621763,0.0019901713822,0.0017447200371,0.00174308067653,0.00174308067653,0.00174308067653,0.00174308067653,0.00174107041676,0.00155978580005,0.0013929863926,0.00129053741693,0.0011078522075,0.0011078522075,0.0011078522075,0.00110741972458,0.000656149175484,0.000655612151604"

It was busy but we were greeted with a smile and seated quickly. The service was friendly and fast. Our glasses did not stay empty for long but the cocktails are pre-mixed in pitchers and the Prosecco pour is less than generous. I'm not looking to get blotto on a Sunday afternoon but after 3 glasses i should have felt a little warmth. Nope, nada. It was juice with the barest hint of effervescence. Food came out suspiciously fast. The Italian sausage frittata was fluffy and cheesy, but the accompanying potatoes were lukewarm and underseasoned.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,45911,"So...cute spot, good food and good servers. My problem with this place was the lack of courtesy they had after a problem they could have solved. I bought a $10 Groupon to get 25% off of my bill and long story short, the restaurant ""declined"" my reservation, causing my Groupon's redeem button to disappear. I showed the manager (at least I think he was the manager since he didn't introduce himself) my Groupon confirmation on the app and in my personal email. The ""manager"" repeatedly told me that they had not declined my reservation when the email said ""Lasagna Restaurant declined your reservation"" and then refused to give me the 25% off of my bill. Now...I understand the fact that they couldn't hit the redeem button, which would allow me to use the Groupon again and that's why they refused to honor the offer (even though it was their fault) BUT...they couldn't give me at least 10% off of my bill for the trouble? We had a couple of drinks, we got apps, dinner and desserts! We weren't annoying through out the entire time and even through the Groupon discussion, I remained calm and polite. I know Groupon will refund me the $10 I paid for the offer I didn't use, but who gives me back a ruined night? By the way we still tipped the server 20%.

But I'm going to do my best so heregoes.I came here last Sunday. We had initially planned to go to Intermezzo just a half a block away, but I've done brunch there before and it was slightly overcrowded. Lasagna thankfully wasn't (at least when we first for there), so Scott B., Alex P., and myself got pretty good service. We got that thing where you can drink for 2 hours with the food you buy, so Alex was down to get our money's worth. I can't even really tell you what I had. I think two scrambled eggs and bacon? It ended up being really good, and was ultimately super reasonable for the price we paid. The ambiance of the place was kind of nice. I can't say I always like waiters wearing muscle shirts, mostly because it makes me feel horrible about myself while I'm eating my face off, but we were brunching in Chelsea so I can't really be mad about it.It got super crowded super fast, which is when boozy time basically started screeching to a halt. The waitstaff was limited, at least on the Sunday I was there, so it was our same waiter coming around with mimosa pitchers whenever he got the chance to... which wasn't much. I might avoid this place if it gets packed, but all in all? Great food, reasonably priced...

The atmosphere is informal and friendly, the kind of place where everyone can feel welcome.  The whole menu is basic Italian served in generous portions, the lasagna is hearty, and the kitchen is accommodating: if something on the menu says it comes in a pink sauce and you want it in a red sauce, no problem.  One major complaint: I often get the fish special, but sometimes its price, not listed on the menu, is way out of line, like twice the price of many of the basic pasta dishes, though not quite as as much as you would pay in fancier restaurants with a more varied menu, like Le Zie.  Another complaint but also a complement: when it is busy there, they are understaffed, which is not good, but the energetic waiter and bus staff do a remarkable job of keeping up with the crowd.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.5,3.59999990463,"Lasagna,atmosphere,neighborhood,lot,money,something,food,reservations,tables,pretense,fish,menu,lasagna,menu,price,menu,complaint,sauce,sauce,everyone,place,portions,menu,problem,complement,complaint,Italian,kitchen,restaurants,job,crowd,waiter,bus staff,Le Zie,price,pasta dishes,many,line","7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,1,1,1,3,7,7,1,7","0.24999691546,0.166460037231,0.069690965116,0.069690965116,0.069690965116,0.0494048222899,0.0270988084376,0.0270988084376,0.0270988084376,0.0270988084376,0.0201551411301,0.0144020775333,0.0121807791293,0.0117699699476,0.0111103234813,0.0107354400679,0.00997696071863,0.00995278637856,0.00911037623882,0.00875631254166,0.00875631254166,0.00871155504137,0.00802802760154,0.00797382090241,0.00743915839121,0.00743915839121,0.00640269834548,0.00611376482993,0.00593931507319,0.00508798658848,0.00410258816555,0.00410258816555,0.00410258816555,0.00351837743074,0.00298000569455,0.00260732881725,0.00260732881725,0.00260732881725"

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,470,"I didn't have a great dinner experience at Lasagna. We made a reservation for 10 people, but when we arrived for our reservation, not only were our tables not prepared but when they finally put tables together for us, they gave us enough seating for 8. They quickly corrected this. The hostess was not very friendly and actually seemed to be more attentive to other tables rather than making sure out table was set up properly. The food itself was very underwhelming. Though the complimentary garlic bread appealed to some, I've definitely had better. They were generous enough to keep refilling out bread, though. The mozzarella sticks were disappointing- I eat mozzarella sticks for the never-ending stringy cheese, but their mozzarella sticks were easily bite-able, with none of that hot stringy cheese- boo. I ordered off the specials menu for the night. Shrimp scallop linguine. Never had I had a more disappointing plate of pasta, which is particularly surprisingly, given the fact that it was that night's special. The scallops were overcooked, chewy, and not fresh. The shrimp was also a bit fishy, but was at least crisp. The pasta as a whole left me feeling hungry but not wanting more of it. Even the lasagnas were underwhelming and that's near namesake! Our waiter service was fine, except for the fact that I didn't feel like he was trained well enough. He reached over people to swipe the menus out from under them when they were done ordering, instead of waiting for the menus to be handed to him. He didn't know the menu well enough and asked, ""chicken salmon??"" a few times when my friend ordered ""chicken balsamic"". At least he had the courtesy of showing us our bottle of very expensive Barefoot moscato before he popped it open to pour the glasses. It was a very confusing and off-putting experience but I know they didn't do it on purpose. At least the ambience was pleasant, with a cozy and intimate feel. I've been to their other location for bottomless brunch and enjoyed it immensely, but I definitely won't be back for dinner- sorry, Lasagna!",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,13.1999998093,"tables,dinner experience,special,Lasagna,experience,tables,reservation,people,reservation,seating,plate,people,tables,table,hostess,food,garlic bread,some,mozzarella sticks,shrimp,specials menu,bottle,mozzarella sticks,mozzarella sticks,bread,stringy cheese,pasta,pasta,waiter service,fact,cheese- boo,none,Shrimp scallop linguine,more,namesake,times,friend,chicken balsamic,Barefoot moscato,courtesy,ambience,glasses,lasagnas,scallops,purpose,feel,location,brunch,menus,menus,menu,chicken salmon","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,7,7","0.0986131951213,0.0851245298982,0.0836255326867,0.0729437172413,0.0486508496106,0.0482336245477,0.0408195778728,0.0408195778728,0.0408195778728,0.0357485339046,0.0281728729606,0.0223187692463,0.0183470323682,0.0183470323682,0.0162044540048,0.0161587968469,0.0154318418354,0.013505355455,0.0126037588343,0.0123245036229,0.0122699104249,0.0116989044473,0.0114182475954,0.0114182475954,0.010404295288,0.010386721231,0.0103449290618,0.00992900598794,0.0098444307223,0.00942269153893,0.00908880587667,0.00908880587667,0.00906315911561,0.00825898069888,0.00825176667422,0.00615168595687,0.00615168595687,0.00615168595687,0.00614747265354,0.00614747265354,0.00507674459368,0.00459300260991,0.00449270242825,0.00447811279446,0.00425384519622,0.00425121467561,0.00424870848656,0.00424870848656,0.0036528587807,0.0036528587807,0.00365021266043,0.00294899567962"

My friend ordered cod, which was also very good and nicely prepared. The bread was unusual but good, and our waiter graciously  brought us a second basket at our request. We both liked the wine (pinot grigio), which was $10.00 a glass, and the surprisingly delicious cappucino. Thank you, Lasagna!

I tried the Ground Sausage Lasgna which was on special and it was quite fantastic. My friend tried the Chicken Marsala which also was really good. Both were reasonably priced and the portions were really big. The two downsides were the four cheese polenta cake gratin and while the cheese was great, the polenta was lacking in both taste and seasoning. The second was with the side pasta with tomato sauce as a side to the chicken marsala. Pasta was cooked well, but the tomato sauce was fairly bland.The service could use some improvement, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

The service and staff are still super great! I came to Lasagna before and had a great experience. Everything was fresh and flavorful, but unfortunately today did not hit the spot. It's especially disappointing because I was entertaining guests from out of town and they also thought the food was not good.We started with the spinach salad which was drenched in a nasty vinaigrette. The salad pieces were all mis-sized. Some pieces being so big you couldn't fit in your mouth. For main course we got the beef sirloin lasagna. The cheese was hard and it looked as if it was microwaved. Inside there was barely any beef or ricotta. The tomato sauce definitely was from a can. It was worse than a TV dinner. We also got the penne filet mignon special. I swear it looked like dog food. Nothing was mingnon about it. I think it was old beef. The penne was bland with no flavors and tossed in peppers which looked like they came from frozen peppers from trader joes. Everything was just bad! Sorry.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,195428,I went to brunch here on 9/19 with a group of 9 and had a very disappointing experience. The menu looked great - and we all did the bottomless drinks. A few people tried the Bloody Mary's but said they tasted horrible. I had mimosa's and they were almost entirely orange juice. Additionally - our server came to our table about once every 15 minutes to refill our 4 ounce glasses. So we didn't really get the benefit of the 'all you can drink'. Finally - we went to pay the bill and were told that we could only split the check 8 ways. Not a huge deal. They took our cards and then never came back. After waiting for 20 minutes - I went to speak with the waiter - at which point he said that their credit card machine was broken and we'd need to pay cash. 2 of the members of our group checked their online banks and their cards were charged.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,37459,"Home delivery debacle Today I called for a home delivery for lunch. A lady answered the phone and I asked her if she could tell me what are the lunch specials because I have no menu. She told me that she had customers waiting and that she didn't have time to go through the lunch special list with me. But, I could find their menu online. So, I thought I'd request the same items that I've had in the past here and asked if I could get a meat lasagna with soup and a chicken Parmesan with Caesar salad. The lady told me that my bill would be $36.91.I got off the phone and I thought that the price sounded a bit more expensive than my past charges for these same lunch specials at this restaurant. So, I did take a minute to go online, look at the lunch menu & this is what I found:-Special chicken Parmigiana or Milanese served over pasta marinara for $10.95-Cheese lasagna or lasagna Bolognese for $16.95-Housemade garlic bread accompanied with soup of the day, nice little house salad, or caesar salad comes with each lunch special. So, after reading this online menu, I did the math and the price should've been $27.90 without tax.So, I called back to ask about the discrepancy in price.The same lady again answered the phone and told me that I must've read the menu wrong because both entrées are $16.95. I explained to her that I was sure that I had read it correctly and she asked me if I was certain that I was looking at the restaurant's actual website. Again, I explained to her that I double-checked and that, according to the online menu, the chicken Parmesan is $10.95 and not $16.95.  She told me that she couldn't do anything about it and what did I want her to do now. Since there was no correcting this overcharge with Lasagna Ristorante from my bill, I decided it best to cancel the entire order and take my business elsewhere. I told the lady that I'm very sorry this was happening with a neighbor and that I would not be doing business with Lasagna Ristorante again. She told me she would credit my credit card and cancel the entire order and our conversation ended.After canceling my order, I looked at their online menu a third time and thought that this is clearly false advertisement. I had been overcharged and when bringing it to their attention, they chose not to correct it. A few minutes after our conversation ended, my phone rang and it was the same lady calling me back. She introduced herself to me as Mana, from Lasagna Ristorante. She said that she was looking right at their website and again I was wrong. She told me that she just wanted me to know this and that she had issued me a credit on my credit card and it should take about three days. She asked me if there was anything else. I responded that we already had this conversation and that there was still no solution offered to the overcharge. Mana responded, ""So now you're getting angry!"" I told her that I'm not angry and that I've been very patient through this situation, which still has no solution available. I told Mana that since we were discussing the menu, yet again, that I wanted her to know that I'm also looking at Lasagna Ristorante's website right now too. And there is one group of items for $10.95 and another group of items for $16.95. The very last item under the $10.95 list is the chicken Parmesan. Mana said, ""Let me look at this again."" She then told me that I was correct and she asked me, ""So, what do you want me to do... comp your whole meal for you?"" This unprofessionalism and lack of any tact whatsoever was endless. I just told Mana that I was hungry and I could order from someone else and let's just allow our second phone conversation (where I ended any further business transactions with Lasagna Ristorante) to take precedence over this final phone call, which serves no purpose but to insult a customer. Mana then said, ""No, I'm sending your meals to you now."" She then hung up the phone and in about 10 minutes the food did arrive with a bill of $36.91 for me to sign. Can you believe this? It was still the same incorrect overcharge that I was originally quoted. I told the delivery person that I could not sign for the bill and that if Mana needed to call me back, she is welcome to call me. I tipped the delivery person $10 and wished him a good day. It's very unfortunate, but I seriously doubt I will ever consider ordering from this restaurant again or have another meal inside this establishment. I want to be done with them.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,51179,"Before my friends and I decided to come to this spot, we pondered how would we ""do our Friday night right"" with a robust meal that would defy the dietary expectations of the Chelsea Body-Nazi hegemony, but we didn't want to go so far as dropping a plate of ghetto fried deliciousness at Dallas BBQ. After our three rounds of drinks at FoodBar, we thought, why not carbo load like we were gonna run a marathon the next day? So Lasagna Ristorante we went, and immediately, our fabulous hostess got us seated in this packed restaurant as soon as we walked through the door. I'd like to flatter ourselves in thinking that it is because all four of us are considered very attractive to various and many segments of the populous, but in truth, it is probably because we were just four fags that happened to score an open four-person table right at the window. Note: the place is SNUG--not a lot of room between tables. Keep your over-sized purses, murses, and body bags at home or in the trunks of your cars.So our waiter--gay naturally--was excellent. Very attentive, was trying to, I believe, flirt with my one friend/work colleagues. But he earned his 20% tip. The calamari appetizer was really good. I think my dinner mates noticed how well executed it was--perfectly tender and crispy. Maybe the best fried calamari I've had in Manhattan to date. I probably didn't praise it enough at the table because 1. too many drinks in the bloodstream, 2. we were too busy yabbering on and on about work (we all work at the same company), and 3. I was too busy exchanging looks, mouthing words, fist tapping, high-fiving, getting my nose playfully squeezed, and hand kissed by and with friend sitting diagonal from me who was setting next to his own BF (note: same friend with whom I went to Po; for more on him read my Po restaurant review). A drama free evening though, and the meat-laden food everyone else got seemed to be well received. As a main course, I had the Lasagna Primavera and have to say, for a restaurant lasagna, it was quite delicious. The portion was generous, the vegetables in it were fresh and maintain their texture through the cooking, which nice because there is always that risk of the vegetables becoming a nearly mash-able mess. It was quite a nice night, mostly having to do with stuff that the restaurant had nothing to do with, but the good feeling it left me made my $60 share of the bill not too troubling, even though it was just fried calamari, lasagna and a Tanqueray & tonic.  We left the restaurant iterating our names to the hostess so she would further remember our faces, because that's how you are supposed to work it for preferential treatment.

Lasagna Ristorante,5424,196 8th Ave,New York,10011.0,1971,"This restaurant for brunch turned out to be a genuine surprise. I spent the better part of a Friday morning at work scouring websites for a boozy brunch. Taking in Yelp suggestions, going through lists. . . . it was intense. Some places were booked solid for reservations because I guess everyone still brunches rain, slush, snow, or shine. Noticed this place with Steph P. and it seemed like a reasonable deal for roughly around $25 of unlimited mimosas/bellinis/screwdrivers/bloody marys with an entrée. They also managed to hold our reservation when someone was running 15 minutes late. But they thought it was amusing that someone *cough* called while I was sitting there with my other friend and she was running from the train station out of breath. Lol. Quickly we were situated at a square table with dead flowers (avante garde chic) next to all of the alcohol at the bar. PRIME LOCATION, kids! The screwdriver was heavy on the booze and light on the oj and tasted delicious. The bellinis were pretty much what I stuck with drinking for most of the meal which went well over the allotted two hours. The mimosa and bellini were probably not as strong as the vodka cocktails because it was a pre-made mixture poured from pitchers. Though, they did pack a slight punch. Food was pretty decent. It was your typical brunch food. I ordered the spicy shrimp and scallop frittata with fresh tomatoes and scallions. Scallops were a little rubbery but the shrimp tasted solid. Can't really dock too many points off for it. Everything was seasoned well and of a generous portion with a side of hash potatoes with red peppers and onions. Steph had ordered the smoked salmon scramble with spinach and my friend Anna ordered the cinnamon brioche French toast. Both entrees again were pretty solid. The French toast I wouldn't splurge for though as it came with a very pie filling like compote that was super incredibly sugary and dense. Almost like canned pie filling with a freckle of freshly chopped nuts and sliced fruit. What I would like to come back and try is their actual lasagna. Hey, its the name of their establishment, it has to be eaten. It's not technically on their brunch menu but they said it is their one pasta dish that they can make an exception for cooked either with a meat sauce or vegetable based primavera sauce. I'm down. Service was what really sold me with the 5 stars. As soon as a glass was empty, it was refilled. Garlic bread is complimentary and delicious as hell and that was refilled. They gave me the last of their knock off Sriracha hot sauce when they didn't have any other. Lol. Staff is incredibly kind and actually interacts with you.

Once I got there, we were seated quite quickly and two of us decided on going with the bottomless option. I tried 2 of the four drinks, the mimosa and bellini. They were both very standard, nothing over the top that blew my mind, but the server was quite quick with constantly refilling me. They gave us some complimentary garlic bread which was quite good. It was colored green which isn't the greatest thing atop bread, but it was good breadI ordered the Frittata Alla Cacciatore. This is where my meal went south. While ordering, I ensured the dish was vegetarian as I had not seen anything that would deem it otherwise. After confirming the waiter took my order to the kitchen. When the meal came back there was a piece of ham by the potatoes. After noticing, I asked my friend to eat it and confirm that it was in fact a piece of meat. Although I could have asked them to take it back, I just moved on with my meal as I was quite hungry. I continued eating with the paranoia that there me be meat on any bite. Luckily There was not any, but eating a meal while digging through to discover what my dish contains is not the ideal scenario. Considering, I asked the server specifically if my meal was vegetarian and a piece of ham just ended up on my plate makes for a disappointing meal. Outside of the ham incident, the meal was quite mediocre. Nothing too special, just a frigate with a few different kinda of vegetables. I wish there was some other flavors there, but it was relatively dull. On the other hand, my friend who ordered the Penne Al Vodka was actually very good and flavorful, and I slightly regret not ordering a more Italian pasta dish. Overall, nothing too special about this place, and at 30 dollars for a bottomless brunch, there are other places in the city with better food at this price point.

While it wasn't too busy, we had to to work to get our server's attention and to ask for more water several times. Sitting along the windows on barstools and a high table felt a bit weird next to people at lower tables, as if we were on display. Maybe some like that LOL.

I ordered the pizzas online and was able to pay through PayPal which made me feel safe and it was super easy. My order was confirmed via text with clear pick up instructions. I was greeted on time by a smile as big as Texas worn by the lovely Nicole and her niece and I immediately felt like I was at home. It's rare to find people as passionate for food as I am and you could tell these ladies LOVED their pizza. The excitement was contagious as pictures were snapped and I was welcomed into the last dragon family. My mom and I couldn't get over how phenomenal they smelled in the car and they tasted EVEN BETTER! My mom commented that the pizza was better than a world famous pizza joint in little Italy that we had had the night before!! Her ""Daddy Greens"" pizza had delicious, fresh, gorgeous vegetables piled high and my ""the Glo"" had the perfect proportions of cheese to sauce to dough.

The macaroni salad and a few other deli counter items are very nice as well, but overall L&H is the kind of place where you find a couple of things that they do very well and you go there just for those things.

However, finding Lassen & Hennigs on one of my two days of jury duty was like finding a special treat. After living in three states since I turned 18 and became a registered voter, I had never been selected for jury duty. That has all changed now. After one year of living in Brooklyn, they found me and as part of my civic duty, I spent two days at the Brooklyn Supreme Court down the street. On my one hour lunch break, I wandered into this lovely little deli after the Yelp app on my phone seemed to point out that it was one of the best choices in the area. I was not disappointed! I had the Knickerbocker Sandwich which was delicious. The tomatoes and the chicken were so perfectly sliced and then so delicately stacked on my sandwich. It was a beautiful thing. I also had the rice pudding after finding out that they were out of bread pudding. It was definitely one of the tastiest rice puddings that I have ever experienced. It wasn't as good as my grandmother's rice pudding but that is pretty hard to beat. It's too bad that I don't have to do jury duty again for another 8 years.

The place is very clean and the people are super nice. The dessert selection was fantastic and everything looked fresh and tasty (and from my experience...is). They have a station for custom salads and a station for custom yogurt parfaits which I thought was a nice touch. The sandwiches are great including all the traditional ones and their signature creations. Everything is a tad pricier than it probably should be (like a regular turkey and cheese sandwich on a roll is $7.50). They also squeeze out all the money they can out of customers by doing things like selling their slices of pie by weight so each piece is priced slightly different from the last instead of just sticking with a fixed price.

Now the frosting was the down side of the cake.. what fills and covers it, is not a cream cheese frosting.  It's just a fluffy regular frosting that to my taste was just way too sweet and unfortunately they put way too much. This is why I could not taste the spices in the cake.

I have also picked up birthday cakes from Lassen & Hennigs as well too. They have a wide variety of cakes to choose from and are very moist. I've tried their Waldorf wrap and it is phenomenal! It is hands down, over the top, the best wrap I've ever had. I've had a Waldorf salad before, but a Waldorf salad rolled together in a wrap is a whole different level here. There was chicken, walnuts, sliced apples, raisins, celery, and mayo rolled into the wrap. I love that they add big slices/chunks of apple. It adds a nice crunchiness and sweetness to the wrap. The celery adds a nice crunch to it too! It's a very light, simple, and super filling wrap. I'm starting to enjoy the food at Lassen & Hennigs very much.

Lassen & Hennigs,5428,114 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,41340,"I feel like my review needs a little refresher, especially since I have been averaging about 3.4 visits per week for the past couple of months. The sandwiches are phenomenal and as previously stated, they will not make you feel like you just ate for two at lunch.My go-to sandwiches are The Pierrepont (roast turkey, the real kind, right off the actual turkey, bacon, lettuce, mayo on a roll) and Cranberry Park (roast turkey, hot stuffing, cranberry sauce on a roll). They have tons of fresh salads every day (potato, macaroni, etc.), as well as a whole row of prepared foods on the other side that all look good.Full bakery with almost everything imaginable. For desserts, the carrot cake is very good, as is the cheesecake. Also, the coconut pie is better than the coconut cake. The fruit tarts are also pretty nice. What? Dessert is not a problem for me, I just go here a lot!There is a trick to ordering here though as there is no line or number system. You enter and stay to your left and go to the back area. When crowded, I survey the crowd and look who is inching toward the glass. They will always call next. At that point, I take a look around and if everyone who was there when I got there does not move, I step in and order. Sometimes people are slow on the trigger here and you just need to step in and order or you will be there a while even with their efficient staff behind the counter.",5.0 star rating,"Montclair, NJ",2,1,0.40000000596,6.80000019073,"sandwiches,review,visits,refresher,everyone,Cranberry Park,roast turkey,turkey,sandwiches,kind,bacon,lettuce,mayo,carrot cake,Pierrepont,Dessert,cheesecake,roll,roll,everything,desserts,problem,coconut pie,people,coconut cake,cranberry sauce,stuffing,salads,macaroni,bakery,side,foods,potato,row,all,lot,lunch.My,fruit tarts,look,glass,order,order,trigger,staff,counter,system,trick,number,line,back area,left,crowd","7,5,4,7,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1","0.126967310905,0.0982707440853,0.0982707440853,0.0835768282413,0.0283309966326,0.0274632573128,0.0227053854614,0.0227053854614,0.0193930175155,0.0180808473378,0.0180808473378,0.0180808473378,0.0180808473378,0.0169407296926,0.0162689425051,0.015370006673,0.0150146763772,0.0139585370198,0.0139585370198,0.0138871045783,0.0138366436586,0.0136220464483,0.0135309919715,0.0135053005069,0.0126279015094,0.0122150992975,0.0122150992975,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0121525675058,0.0115525359288,0.0109847309068,0.0107149127871,0.0103484764695,0.00950748007745,0.00818570703268,0.00646374840289,0.0064571951516,0.00564962113276,0.00564962113276,0.00564962113276,0.0044115120545,0.0044115120545,0.00360152055509,0.00360152055509,0.00359614565969,0.00359614565969,0.00359134469181"

Lassen & Hennigs,5428,114 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,23439,"I first wrote a really scathing review for this place because I was really angry that they messed up my sandwich to the point where it was not edible and I literally hadn't eaten all day... I ordered in because I don't think I could have made it to the nearest food establishment or grocery store. That said, they really don't deserve 1 star because whoever makes their sandwiches can't read and/or understand english. They also keep forgetting straws which makes drinking my large iced coffees kind of difficult. Their delivery is kind of sloppy, once I had someone call and say they were out of whatever flavored something or other, but usually they'll just give you whatever muffin despite the fact that you ordered something else. That's really my fault, though because 1) I probably shouldn't be eating any sort of baked anything and 2) If I do east some sort of baked, fattening something or other, I should walk there and back.Anyway, Lassen &amp; Hennigs is a really great gourmet deli and has a really awesome selection of everything, especially if you want to grab something to eat later (like a sandwich or a salad) or a dessert. They have a fantastic selection of prepared meals. The coffee is excellent and if I didn't work at Starbucks, I would totally tell you to go there rather than Sbux which is basically next door. If you like croissants, go there. Their filled croissants are incredible. Like France. So, I'm sorry Lassen &amp; Hennigs.

Yeah, that's right, a little deli has the excellent excellent cheesecake. It's all in the crust. I like the cheese part a tad firmer, but it tastes fabulous. The crust is PERFECT. Just go here, get some, and get back to me. It's so much better than all of the other places I've been to in NYC that claim to have the best - especially Junior's (the most over-rated cheesecake ever). I really just can't believe it! I even ""tried"" it over and over and over again just to reassure myself that it's true.... it is.This really is a 5-star gourmet deli, and what's funny is that it's so very basic for a gourmet deli. But I like that L&H is more old-fashioned - and it's not one of those salad bar places - or flashy, expensive bougie gourmet delis like Garden of Eden. It's kind of no-frills, but the food is really good, and has all the frills for what it costs. Not only that, their yummy take-away food is so much more AFFORDABLE than most of the other gourmet spots that have popped up over the past decade, in my opinion. What's cool is how you can get something here, and take it over to the promenade and have yourself a nice, cheap meal with a lot of ambianceI hear this place has been here forever, and has always been good. The staff seems comfortable in their service ettiquette and jobs which always bodes well for customers, I think cuz when people hate their jobs they take it out on you. Here they are really low-key here, yet happy to help you.

Late Night Deli,5429,905 Metropolitan Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,41631,"Touted on the awning as ""The Best Sandwich in the Neighborhood"", I just had to check it out.  Now, first about the place:Half Bodega, half deli.  The bodega has got to be the CLEANEST and most ORGANIZED bodega I have every stepped foot in.  It is smaller than most, and a lot of the space is aisle, but they have a little bit of all the essentials you could possibly expect from a bodega, and a little bit more.   The beer selection is a little more sparse compared to others, and your standard 6-pack goes for $10.The sandwich:Boar's Head meats and quality sandwich making skills on that French style hero.  The bread was going south by 7pm (I don't consider that out of the ordinary though), and the meats / cheese was sliced ultra thin.  It was tasty and satisfying, but don't expect the all-American style bloated more-than-you-can-eat jammed with meat kind of sandwich.  It was probably about as much as you would put on your sandwich had you made it at home.  At $4.99, its on par with what a sandwich should cost at a deli.I wouldn't say this is the ""best sandwich"" in the neighborhood, but it qualifies as a wholesome, satisfying meal.Bonus star for the cleanliness, order, and organization of the place!  Almost gave them an extra star for the Turkish music blasting from the radio and the counter people singing along.--------As a side note, I think the place has either been redone or changed ownership since Andrea D. has reviewed it.

What kind of friend would I be if I showed up empty-handed at someone's house? I looked around and I saw that there's a wine shop open till 11pm on a Saturday. I walk in and maybe because Trader Joe's Wine shop has spoiled me or something because their selection ain't all that and a bag of chips. And secondly, it's kinda pricey for what it is. I opted to walk out and proceed to Late Night because from the outside, it looks like a seedy bodega where they'd sell some cheap beer.  Key words: Seedy and Bodega.And then I saw 4 Loko in their freezer.

The space was perfect and even the ambiance of the band playing in the background. The band was a bit loud, but that was the point right? Regardless, they only had one guy for our entire section which in my opinion is a 2-3 person job. He did his best and refilled our water as fast as humanly possible. HOWEVER, then the bottom fell out. There was some mix-up in the kitchen -- I am honestly not sure what happened, but our food did not come out for over 2 hours. Now, we had a fixed menu (Chicken, Eggplant, Salmon, or Steak) so they knew what to expect. It was not like we asked for custom dishes for each person.The food was superb, and honestly there are no complaints -- maybe it had a TAD bit too much butter for my tastes.

The service is beyond terrible. I have been there multiple times because I was craving their spinach empanadas and that is and will remain the only reason I ever go back there. The ladies that work behind the counter love to talk to and engage in conversation with the customers that speak Spanish and that is totally okay - in fact, I think it's a great showcase of friendly customer service. However, each time I have gone here and waited patiently on line for them to finish whatever conversation they were having with the person in front of me, they would completely skip over me and talk to the next Hispanic customer after me. Is this intentional? Maybe. Is it okay? Absolutely not. It became almost impossible at that point to get any of their attention to just place any small order of 2-3 empanadas which are right by the window staying warm. And by the time they DO get to little old me, their smiles are gone and I get the feeling they don't want to help me much less look at me.

Latin Bakery Restaurant,5432,41-41 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,71766,"Whenever I tell my friends that there's a Latin restaurant on Main Street in Flushing, they're always pretty surprised. To me, this shows a) how diverse Flushing is and b) how isolated and disjointed our ethnic communities are from each other. I come here for lunch sometimes, and I am always the only Asian person there.But enough with the social commentary/observation... the food here is great, no matter who you are. I've had the chicken soup and rice, which is definitely a full meal. I particularly like the rice, I'm not sure what they put in it but it has a nice subtle flavor. The meals are also great. Most recently I had a beef stew dish with rice, beans, plantains, and a salad. It's definitely a lot of food, but the beans really go well with the rice and meat. I've also had empanadas here, which are an awesome snack when on the go. Especially the spinach. One thing that annoys me a bit is that the counter on the side of the dining area (pretty much the only place to sit at during lunch if you're a solo diner) is way too high. That, or the bar stools/chairs are too low (though they actually are kind of high. Maybe I should just grow a little taller, but eating with a perfectly straight back isn't always something I can keep up throughout a meal.

If I can be picky about anything, the seating area is kinda small/cramped and the seating not very well thought out. A very inconspicuous place too...kinda hidden in plain sight lol.

The young girl sucked her teeth and said, ""I don't know how to make that!"" She then proceeded to shake her head no to her coworker. They had no idea I heard the exchange. Soon after (I'm guessing) the owner of Laten's came out asking, ""Who asked for a LIT?""He made it and then asked me to taste it to see if it was to my liking.

My problem is with the management and employees representing the place.I had arrived expecting to use the $30 Yelp Coupon. This coupon is only good for sit ins. Once there the service was exceptionally slow. Granted, it was a busy Sunday afternoon and they may have been short staffed. 2-3 tables of 3-4 people each with 4 employees. We had to go up and order on our own. Water for our tables came at the end of the meal and when paying the apparent owner/manager was unfamiliar with their specials and tried to overcharge me. Let's evaluate the situation in both cases.Case # 1: The prices were  6.95 x 4 = 27.80 x 1.0875 = 30.45. He told me I owed an additional $7.44 based upon those numbers. He emphasized that the coupon only covered the balance pre tax. Perfectly reasonable. So with all of that in mind, then that would leave me with a balance of 2.65. He asked me for $7.44 That simply didn't add up. When I complained about the blatantly incorrect math, he emphatically expressed that the food is cheap and it's not his fault coupons work that way. I don't mind the law, or the coupons. I mind your attitude and your inability to take the time to review the situation.Case # 2: The prices were 7.95 x 4 = 31.80 x 1.0875 = 34.5825. In this case the 30 dollar coupon would apply in its entirety and the balance of 4.58 was due. Still very reasonable. But not the $7.44 you wanted.Was my problem with the cost? No. It was admittedly cheap. My point is, I was given a condescending attitude and poor service that culminated in an overall mediocre experience.",2.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",2,0,-0.10000000149,10.3000001907,"food,problem,specials,tables,Latin,management,employees,Yelp Coupon,place.,coupon,dollar coupon,service,employees,sit ins,people,owner/manager,food,coupon,specials,tables,balance,situation,Water,balance,order,meal,end,numbers,attitude,case,all,mind,entirety,Case # 1,point,balance pre tax,service,prices,cost,you,experience,fault coupons,coupons,situation.Case # 2,attitude,prices,way,math,law,inability","7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.309901595116,0.172103270888,0.0679510980844,0.0382243730128,0.0341842398047,0.0312268864363,0.0312268864363,0.0244904477149,0.02264486067,0.0192913524806,0.0181812383235,0.0142042497173,0.0118737155572,0.0104453843087,0.0103919589892,0.00954205729067,0.00864280294627,0.0083773182705,0.00799293536693,0.00799293536693,0.00799235142767,0.00798102933913,0.00773984985426,0.00710244383663,0.00700622471049,0.00699438992888,0.00699438992888,0.00697465753183,0.00675858743489,0.00640215585008,0.00636189803481,0.00636189803481,0.00473447097465,0.00472756195813,0.00400296831504,0.00393943721429,0.00373544218019,0.00345919886604,0.00327401887625,0.00327401887625,0.00326822395436,0.00318638049066,0.00314367143437,0.00265116011724,0.00237579434179,0.00234586070292,0.00208182563074,0.00208182563074,0.00208012270741,0.00207852409221"

I give our waitress 5 stars out of 5.Food:I give it 3 stars out of 5.For appetizers we ordered the Potato Balls with Beef & Pork Filling, fried on the outside & nice warm in the inside. The combination & seasoning of the Beef & Pork was tasty. For the kids we ordered French Fries & there wasn't anything special about it. The kids didn't even finished the french fries & when I tried them I didn't blame them since the fries were over done & not under seasoned. For Entrees we ordered Picadillo which happened to be the winner out of all plates. The flavors of the Picadillo was really good, it was juicy & very flavorful. By the way, if you don't know what Picadillo is, just ask for them to give you a sample of it before you pass up on something that you might like. I wished I had ordered the Picadillo but since the reviews & specialty is The Pernil I decided to go with the Pernil with a side of maduros. I was very disappointed since it was under season BUT tender at least. Nothing really special about the Rice & Beans, it just tasted like regular rice & beans. There were 3 adults that ordered Pernil & one of us didn't like it at all that decided to order something else after tasting it so they ordered the Ox Tail. Other than having Ox Tail as a Special for Tuesdays no one is really writing much about Ox Tail, but why not? Well, the same person that didn't like the Pernil also not liking the Ox Tail (not really sure why since I didn't want to try it). My girlfriend had the 6 Piece Shrimp in garlic sauce with a side of Fried Yuca & it was ok, nothing special about it.For Dessert we ordered Rice Pudding & Flan, but we were told that they had not received a shipment of Flan just yet. Really??? You can't make a Flan at the restaurant? The Rice Pudding was just Rice Pudding, once again nothing special. So, since they didn't get there shipment of Flan I decided to go for Dulce de Leche Cortado. Once again nothing special about it, I have had better home made.Do I recommend the place? If you want an Ok Cuban restaurant then yeah. If you want some  really good Cuban No! Perhaps I should give it another try & if I do I'll go for the Ropa Vieja or Bistec Con Cebollas.

You can choose which flavors you'd like just keep in mind that it is $1 per flavor.    My particular mix was mango, papaya, pina (pineapple), banana and passion fruit.Oh was it GOOD!Feel free to use this combo but do give me the credit for kicking your taste buds.To continue to stave off this hungry streak...3) Pernil Special - which is a combo of roasted pulled pork (MM MMM GOOD) that comes with rice (choose yellow) and a side of beans (choose red).     The pork was tender but I would have liked it with BBQ sauce or picante (hot sauce) to give it that flavorful kick a notch higher.    Fortunately, the hot sauce was already on the table.    = D4) Cubano Sandwich -

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,32119,"I'm a big fan of Cuban food and Latin Cabana never disappoints. I've heard great things about the sandwiches but I'm too addicted to the daily specials to branch out. Recently a few friends and I went to a well known Cuban restaurant in Corona and while the place had great service, ambience ( and a bar ), the food just wasn't as good as Latin Cabana.The food at Latin Cabana is so flavorful and tangy you might want to yell SABROSA! The Ropa Vieja is really something else and I'm a big fan of all their Salteado's as well. They also load every dish up with bay leaves so it feels great even if you have a sensitive stomach like me.  The black, yellow, and white rice are all on point but I maybe prefer the rice at Pollos Marios a little bit more (mostly because it's 50% butter).The new location lacks some of the soul of the previous spot and it would be great if these guys got a liquor license. Ambience is probably the weakest thing going for these guys.The one thing I've had that isn't as good as it probably could be would be the Pollo Asado. It's perfectly fine and is pretty tasty but there are too many better options for rotisserie chicken in the neighborhood. Pollos Ala Brasa Mario's has much better chicken. That being said Latin Cabana has the best beans in the neighborhood.

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,3050,"OMG OMG OMG. LATIN CABANA. Let me count the ways...the food here is orgasmic. I've been here a few times and tried their empanadas (pretty good, not Mama's Empanada standard, but still good), tostones (fantastic! not pressed too much so that it becomes a potato chip like thing (although they sells those as well, made on-site of course) but nicely sized and thick tostones, just the way I like them :D.The white rice isn't burnt or overcooked, another one of the gripes I sometimes have with white rice in Latin restaurants - just add a pinch of salt and you're golden - also they have an olive oil/vinegar sauce on the table that also tastes amazing if you put it on the rice...or on anything really.Their yuca is boiled to perfection and simmered in a traditional garlic sauce that's not too powerful (so I like to dip it into a garlic mojo, which they make differently to what I'm used to seeing as I'm half Puerto Rican and half South American and used to a creamier garlic mojo versus a more oil based one) but it's still tasty stuff and great with tostones, meat, rice and of course - boiled [or fried] yuca.The pernil here (which thankfully is a part of their daily special EVERYDAY) is off the charts delicious. Flavorful, perfectly seasoned, slow cooked, pulled pork heaven that's been slow cooked in lime/garlicky goodness. SO FREAKIN' GOOD and tastes deliciously HOMEMADE.Also, I also always ask for their garlic mojo (Mojo is essentially a work for Latin watery yummy sauces that normally use olive oil as a base, think aoli but less buttery) and I use it on my rice, meat, beans, tostones, empanada, sandwich or whatever I get because I think garlic tastes good on anything and I'm not a vampire...so I take advantage.If you come here for your first time and like pork - DO IT. If you come here for your 13th time and like pork - DO IT. If you don't like pork (but are not allergic to it!) then - DO IT, you won't regret it. It's fantastic.My boyfriend has had their large Cuban burger and he loved it, he's also had their sautéed chicken (it's a Wednesday daily special) with yellow rice and red beans and he was quite happy. He's actually the reason we've eaten here a few times as of late! My first encounter was simply 2 take-out empanadas on my way to meeting him at a movie theater. Super happy we've actually gotten to eat here and experience their actual food. They even have traditionally Latin-Caribbean, Mexican and Colombian sodas that are fruit flavored, carbonated but sans caffeine or artificial sweeteners like corn fructose - my kind of sodas! :DPrices here are also crazy reasonable and the portions here are HUGE. The two times I've ordered the daily special I was unable to finish at least half (see my pictures!) and both times I had my excess food wrapped to go and both times other people ate my other half...guess it's that good folks.There's also a lot of social media promotions for this place (not needed, since they're already cheap - but hey, discounts never hurt anyone!) - look on Scoutmob, foursquare and even our darling Yelp . What I did learn (at least with the Scoutmob/foursquare 50% off promo) that you want to mention this to them BEFORE you order.They tried to give me a little trouble last night, but I respectfully reminded them that the coupon said nothing about when to mention and he honored it without a problem. I'll do it correctly the next time and assume perhaps a smaller serving? Which I'm sure would still be more than enough.Latin Cabana is also a preferred Seamless partner (whatever that means, lol) so they deliver (which I have yet to do, but probably will someday in the very near future) and has a cute space which works perfectly for a casual date (especially with them being a hop, skip and a jump away from the Kaufman Astoria movie theater!), group get-together, informal family dinner or alone noms.I really can't say enough positive things about the food here.

Good service with an attentive waitress and clean bathrooms.  I love how they have different specials on different days for like 8.95 with some side orders.  I tried one of my friend's mofongo, and it was delicious.  It was light and fresh and had a nice garlic undertone to it without feeling like that taste of too much seasoning.  To be fair, I am not Cuban, so maybe I don't have a discerning taste.  Yes, the decor is a bit rustic with all the Halloween fare but that's what makes this place so charming.  The sandwich portions are pretty hefty, and you may have enough to go home.  The pricing is fair, so what the heck.

Same food menu.Movie theater is a block & a half away (you can see Pc richards from restaurant storefront). Come here! Instead of bland & fast-food processed Unos or Applebees.Came with groupon deal (no reservation needed). It was a great deal. 2 entrees (no sandwiches), 2 side orders and 2 desserts for $29! We got full sized servings. The yellow rice is delicious!!! Its seasoned with real herbs & flavors (not like pretend yellow rice- white rice colored with achiote). Very homemade. The same is true about the ropa vieja and black beans. My bf had the fried pork chops. They were quite big & looked good. Ordered the empanadas de queso de crema as our side order- they were fresh. Not prepared earlier & refried prior to serving as i have had in other latin restaurants. Ordered both the cascos de guayaba & coco raspado....the cascos are delicious typical cuban desserts. I looooove the combination of guava & cream cheese. And coco raspado is typical of the caribbean though flavored differently than wat im used to here at the restaurant-by itself tasted good. Was not a fan of it with the cream cheese (served in 3 round scoops). Im going to save the cream cheese scoops for breakfast & slap it on a bagel lol I highly recommend this restaurant for awesome authentic cuban food at a great price.

The only reason I am giving this a 3 star is the hiccup I had with the management about the yelp check in coupon.I am also a fan of finding restaurants that's local, family run, and have a more homely feel to it. I just feel like they stay more true to the cuisine and give a better experience. Upon arrival, we were greeted quickly and seated wherever we wanted. The table I picked had nice wide chairs but the table itself was a bit dirty, probably not wiped from a prior customer. As we ordered our food, I checked in and there was this coupon that Yelp stated I can use so I ordered more food to get up to the $25. I got the chicken with their cuban rice w/beans and a separate bean side by itself. The meal was amazing, very filling and delicious. I was craving beans and they definitely fulfilled my cravings. The side salad was very basic and what you typically get at any Latin American restaurant. Finally, their smoothies were delicious and freshly made. Definitely a treat to get.Now I'll get to the ugly part. When the check came, I showed the waiter the yelp coupon. He took my phone to the manager and the manager came to tell me that for me to use the deal, I needed to present this coupon to the waiter in the beginning before I ordered. I thought this reason was complete BS and they didn't want to give me the discount. The waiter was apologetic but still, this was such a BS reason.Overall, the food was delicious and cheap.

Our table was in the middle so he had to pass by us. Anyway we finally ordered and to tell you the truth I didn't like the pork chops too dry. Rice was ok and steak was ok all and all the food was plenty but it wasn't like fresh food. Everything that we order was like ready to eat. The only good thing was that we were hungry and at that point all you want is to eat. You really don't need a groupon to eat there the ad on groupon says it's value $103.60, that not true.

So I asked for another special and once again was turned down. Strike 2.

We approached the counter to pay, but I guess this a trustworthy type of restaurant as the woman at the cash register told us we could sit first, enjoy our food and then pay upon leaving.The serving size of the food on our plates was huge, as expected with many Latin American restaurants. As I said, the food was good, but not extremely great. The Pernil was just a bit too oily for my liking. I understand it's pork and the more oily the better, but the oil was seeping into my rice and plantains and making everything mushy. The Pernil's meat was really good though. Also, the sweet plantains were a bit dry and if I didn't know any better were probably sitting there for awhile. I had a taste of my friend's beans and it would've been wiser for me to go with that option. In closing, the restaurant is pretty small with a few tables and one TV.

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,16484,"**The one star is for service only**Explanation: came here after reading all the great reviews about the food. However, their service was horrendous. We came in at around 7pm and the place was fairly empty. There were only maybe two other tables that were ordering/waiting for their food. We were given the menus and since a waiter didn't come up to us, we had time to decide on what to order. Tried to flag down the waiter several times to get some water and get our order in. Seriously, we had to call on the waiter at least 4x just for the water and each time, they said ""be right with you""...which they never came back. At this point, we were pretty irritated because other people (who came in after us) were getting their water and shakes. We have been sitting at the table for about 30 minutes without water. How hard is it to fill up four cups of tap water?! Meanwhile, while we were dying of thirst, the waiters are running back and forth to give the other table sauces, dishes, etc. Not to mention, once we got our food, they conveniently ""forgot"" our side dishes. We ordered three entrees (each with 2 sides) and they only gave us one side of the maduros. When we asked about the other two sides, the waiter responds ""oh, did you want it?""..... uhhh..what kind of question is that?? If it came with the entrees ofcourse we want it! Seriously, it was three entrees with one small plate of maduros. What!? When the check came, we realized they charged us extra for a side/drink but it would probably have taken another hour to get their attention and get it sorted out so we just said f*** it, lets just get the f*** out of there. Not sure if they were giving special treatment to others because of race but I sure hope, and don't want to think that is the case. Now, on to the fun part...FOOD! 3 * * * stars!1) maduros- so deliciously sweet. They come in small pieces, so each piece is perfectly browned and slightly crisp.2) red snapper- perfectly fried and crispy. the garlic and lime juice definitely adds to the flavor. We ate that down to the bones.3) pernil w/ yellow rice- rice was extremely soft and good. The pernil was good but a bit on the salty side.4) ground beef w/ rice- surprisingly good. It almost tasted like a sloppy joe but drier and better.5) mofongo with crispy pork- the worst dish out of everything. Couldn't find any crispy pork in there. The mofongo was extremely dry, hard and bland. Even with the sauce it tasted horrible. I've never had mofongo like that before. 6) cassava- I didn't understand the sticky consistency. I've never had it before like that. I liked the garlic sauce with it though. 7) flan- it was flan..nothing special. A bit too sweet and it wasn't silky like I expected it to be. The mango (or I think it was mango) that came with it was extremely sour. My friend hated it and spit it back out. 8) mango papaya shake- fresh, wasn't too sweet, didn't really have mango flavor in it. I think they might use a different mango than the ones sold at the market. Perhaps the greener/harder mangoes?I wasn't sure if the food tasted good or we were just super hungry to notice. The service left such a sour taste that I don't think the food could have made up for it. Other yelpers found their service friendly but I guess we were just unlucky. One last thing about the bathroom: there is a buzzer that the waiters press to open the door to the bathroom. But once you get inside, there's no lock. Good thing I was just washing my hands because they buzzed open the door for someone who was waiting outside to go in.

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,23619,"Comfort food, every culture has some form of comfort food. It is not fancy, but solid. It is tasty. It is served fast. It is cheap. It fills your belly and satisfies your hunger pains. By the time you walk out of the restaurant, your saying to yourself ""damn that was good; I must of been hungry"".Latin Cabana, does all of the above. Solid family style food like mom use to make. Not fancy cuts of meats or beautiful plate presentation, but a hearty plate of delicious food. Latin Cabana is not a fancy restaurant, but a small hole in the wall Latin restaurant on Steinway with oversize tables and Latin salsa music in the air. I would not recommend as a first date place, but would take my wife because of that home style ambiance.Everyone comes here for their daily specials, which rotates daily and you have four choices. You have ropa vieja (shredded beef), pernil, cod fish, beef stew, chicken stew, etc. with a selection of rice (white, yellow or moro) and a veggie (yucca, beans, platanos, salad). Before 3 PM $6.95 and after 3 PM $7.95.This Latin version of their Blue Plate Special is piled high with food. Nothing fancy, but a delicious plate of food. Pernil is shredded, but moist and flavorful. Yucca was way over done, but it was delicious. Lots of flavor. Especially with mojo sauce. Yum. Ropa vieja wet and saucy, just like i like it. Mixes well with the rice. All good and tasty.Overall, this is a great place for Cuban comfort food.

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,55190,"Finally!  I have found one authentic Cuban restaurant in New York City and it of course is in Queens, not Manhattan.  This is a genuine family Cuban restaurant with real Cuban prices, real Cuban taste, and real Cuban portions!  I was becoming increasingly depressed that my dream of moving to New York was realized and then I was stuck eating at Americanized Latin-Fusion places like Cafe Habana in that SoHo/NoLIta area of Manhattan.  These places charge you over $11 for food that has half the taste and half the quantity!  Here, you can get an entree and 3 sides (i recommend the quintessential Cuban trio: white rice, black beans, and maduros) all for $5.95!  You can immediately tell upon walking in that the place was authentic because of the sounds, the smells, and the actual Cuban family running the restaurant.  The meal I had here was simple, cheap, and delicious, and was actually the best meal I've had so far in my 3 months in New York.  It's very hard to find honest meals like this in Manhattan.  Generally, you have to go above 96th st or to the outer boroughs to get such a delight.  I tried one of the daily specials: the ropa vieja and it tasted just like how my grandmother used to make it.  It came with delicious white rice and black beans that brought flooding memories of what real Cuban beans taste like.  I've been hating going to these all-American places with nothing but American customers and having the most bland black beans in my life.  If you taste these beans and can't tell the difference between these beans and the ones at a place like Cafe Con Leche or Cafe Habana, then I simply can't help you.  I FINALLY found a good cafe con leche in this city and just like I've been telling people, the good ones are $1 like here in Latin Cabana.  In Cafe Habana in downtown Manhattan, they have the gall to actually charge you $3.50 for the worst excuse for a cafe con leche I've ever had.  This one had authentic Cuban flavors.  I was seriously savoring each and every sip like a crack addict because I grew up on this stuff and I haven't had any in so long.  If you get a cafe con leche, remember to add plenty of sugar (especially if you're using real sugar) because that's the way it's supposed to be: sweet, with no foam, with Cuban beans, and it should warm you up in the perfect way.  Keep trying sips of the coffee and adding sugar until it becomes just the way you like it.   Cuban ladies know how to make a man feel at home.  Their food is hot, cheap, and plentiful and they serve the coldest drinks in the world in a completely cozy, hipster-free, non-ironic, Caribbean atmosphere. A word on the croquettas: they are INCREDIBLE.  They make them PRECISELY the way they should be: hot, crispy, YET soft.  The ham inside is transcendental.  The maduros were also excellent, but they're typically a little bit softer than these.  If you want to try the croquettas in a sandwich, get one of my favorites: the croquetta preparada.  You will never find Americans making Cuban food this good.  This is the result generations of savvy and experience being put into effect.   It takes me 2 trains to get out here to Astoria, but I don't care, it's so good that it's worth it and I don't leave feeling like a douche bag who's been cheated like I do at all these American-Latin-Fusion restaurants pretending to be Cuban.  Long live Latin Cabana and please God don't let the hipsters come here and start bringing their buzz words like ""mojitos"" and ""sangria"" and ""tomatillo"" and ""yellow rice with baked chicken"" and all that crap. If you come and don't know what to order, I recommend trying out the vaca frita, the bacalao, the piccadillo, the bistec empanizado, the sandwiches, and the croquettas.  Those are real Cuban dishes.  Please God don't let the masses come in and start confusing Mexican culture with Cuban culture and making small crappy American food for ludicrous prices.    This is real food served by real people at honest prices, and I hope this is one aspect of New York that will not be ruined by followers and assimilators of counter-culture.A word on how I found this place (so you guys can see what strategy to use).  I came here on yelp and typed New York, NY and hit enter.  Then, I filtered out restaurants, then Cuban restaurants.  Then, I filtered out to only show places with 1 dollar sign ($).  The reason I did that was because no good Cuban restaurant will ever cost more than one dollar sign.  If you see two dollar signs ($$), it's most likely going to be really Americanized because Americans are completely comfortable charging whatever they want knowing that naive people will buy it anyway.  Cubans running a Cuban restaurant will always serve you the real stuff with huge portions and small prices.  I looked through the list after I filtered everything, and I immediately ignored anything in Manhattan under 96th St and found this place in Queens.  I was confident and I was correct using this strateg",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",6,0,0.20000000298,26.2000007629,"Cuban,restaurant,food,sugar,places,Manhattan,plenty,New York City,restaurant,places,black

This is a small cuban restaurant with a cuban flare to it, I don't know how well the people can speak spanish but you can tell they are strictly spanish by their accents and that makes it even better, it makes you feel that your food is being done by the correct hands. I love this menu, I love that they have oxtail (which no one in Astoria seems to have), and my boyfriend loves their crunchy chicken with extra lemon. The meals are big just like the perfect spanish places do it, enough to fill you up for two days.

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,2104,"Of the many Steinway eateries in Astoria / LIC, there are few that are as awesome as Latin Cabana. The best way to sum up their schtick is high quality, affordable Cuban fare in a pseudo-divey setup. You throw in an additional big portions and fast service, good times are had at this 5 star establishment. Most folks may equate them as a delivery spot and rightfully so. There isn't a ton of seating in the place, but groups can have their fun here and solo diners as well. They've done an interesting job of making the ambiance semi-tropical, From the afternoon till the night the music from the kitchen blasts Latin tunes worthy of a jukebox at a bar.First (and for many people the only) thing worth looking into is their daily specials, which vary from a $7 platter of pernil (pork) to a $8 carne guisada (beef stew). Is there a better deal in town? Probably. Do those other deals come with as much food as Latin Cabana's? Highly unlikely. The pernil platter, a practically stewed version of pulled pork is encompassed by two sides of your choice (typically some type of rice or beans),  is so hearty that big appetites would be in a food coma. My personal favorite is their guisada, a beef stew that has perfectly cooked potatoes and veggies, coupled by juicy and chunky pieces of beef. Serve it over some of their yellow rice or Cuban rice (mixed beans), and you've got dinner for less than $8.Other options are definitely available, though the a la carte prices for entrees are easily deflected in favor of their daily specials. Albondigas, or meatballs, are soft and juicy and the picadillo is equally tasty. Their fried sweet plantains are an easy thumbs up and the boiled yuca is not much to look at, yet is surprisingly solid. There is also some talk of folks stopping by just for their empanadas prior to seeing a movie at the nearby United Artists Theater (yelp.com/biz/ua-kaufman-…). I love the beef empanadas, though the chicken is gaining some momentum as my favorite.A minor drag is their delivery service minimum of $25. It's not an end all clearly, since many folks are willing to order it. They have coupons on Grubhub, Yelp check-in offers, and first time Seamless discounts that the prices aren't so daunting anymore. If you happen to find yourself hungry after a trip to the Museum of the Moving Image or when you're done checking out a show at the theater, make your next eating destination Latin Cabana.",5.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",3,0,0.5,11.5,"fare,eateries,Steinway,LIC,Astoria,Latin Cabana,service,times,schtick,setup,portions,star establishment,groups,specials,delivery service minimum,people,a la carte prices,beef empanadas,folks,beef stew,ambiance semi-tropical,folks,ton,favorite,deals,delivery spot,diners,seating,place,fun,kitchen,music,job,Cuban,plantains,deal,rice,guisada,beef,some,thing,appetites,beef stew,pork,pernil,platter,rice,rice,food,beans,pork,pernil platter,beans,jukebox,tunes,First,carne,town,type,food coma,version,choice,sides,folks,pieces,potatoes,veggies,entrees,options,Latin,coupons,movie,chicken,momentum,end,dinner,theater,prices,offers,discounts,trip,eating destination,United Artists Theater,show,favor,picadillo,yuca,talk,specials,empanadas,meatballs,Albondigas,Grubhub,Yelp,Seamless,Museum of the Moving Image","7,2,3,3,2,3,7,7,7,7,2,4,3,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,2,5,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,1,2,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,4,2,2,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2","0.118957147002,0.0494636334479,0.0294093061239,0.0294093061239,0.0294093061239,0.0274428538978,0.0268557462841,0.0268557462841,0.0236324388534,0.0236324388534,0.0235118363053,0.0235118363053,0.0218782704324,0.0217021610588,0.0208368655294,0.0153243020177,0.0128001701087,0.0122816963121,0.0117381541058,0.0117271281779,0.0114841880277,0.01125788223,0.0109425252303,0.00918235443532,0.00916005298495,0.00896145123988,0.00893616676331,0.00893616676331,0.00893616676331,0.00893616676331,0.00891556032002,0.00891556032002,0.00891556032002,0.0086681637913,0.00861042644829,0.00840977858752,0.00750642735511,0.00740173412487,0.00738521013409,0.00737772649154,0.00737302051857,0.00731662753969,0.00688047986478,0.00688047986478,0.00688047986478,0.00688047986478,0.00685494858772,0.00685494858772,0.006845228374,0.00682784849778,0.00682784849778,0.00682784849778,0.00623517623171,0.0060202148743,0.0060202148743,0.0060202148743,0.0060202148743,0.006008467637,0.00597415445372,0.00597415445372,0.00597415445372,0.00597415445372,0.00597415445372,0.00571154663339,0.0054610259831,0.0054610259831,0.0054610259831,0.00545548927039,0.00545548927039,0.00528017990291,0.00490583246574,0.00464643491432,0.00406210124493,0.00406210124493,0.00405915873125,0.00402459455654,0.00320793525316,0.00301282876171,0.00280836969614,0.00280836969614,0.0028065436054,0.0028065436054,0.00275068893097,0.00247228448279,0.00224662059918,0.0021876890678,0.00218577566557,0.00218398729339,0.00204329728149,0.00203792355023,0.00178588961717,0.00167614687234,0.00166226038709,0.00166226038709,0.00166226038709,0.001661179238"

Latin Cabana,5434,34-15 Steinway St,Long Island City,11101.0,1971,"""I've never had Cuban food"". At least I don't think I have and if I have its been mixed or integrated into other foods. But multiple people were shocked and appalled at this. So, after acknowledging this and having a friend stay over this past weekend she persuaded me into journeying back into Queens to test out one of her favorite Astorian Cuban spots with her boyfriend. The restaurant isn't really anything that stands out. It's covered in orange and green advertising and inside has bamboo like long tables with a scenic Caribbean backdrop. Makes you want to go on vacation, right? Maybe not. But the menu was enticing. We started off with getting one empanada. They had cream cheese flavored ones and none of us had tried that before. It was interesting. Probably not something I'd get again. Also, not the best empanadas on the face of the earth but still crunchy and pleasant tasting. As a side I got plantains and they were out of this world delicious. Like eating a carmelized desert. Which I regretted also getting a Mango Smoothie. The smoothie was good, don't get me wrong, but super filling and had an odd after taste I can't quite figure out. I split one of the specials of the day 'Pernil', Pork that comes with white rice and a side of your choice. The helpings are HUGE. And for about $6. So really $3 a person or you get an extra meal out of it. Though, my friend's boyfriend happily finished his entire meal with ribs, rice and a side. For our free side we got I believe Cassava. It's a really peculiar root that originates from South America. It's a pure carbohydrate with zero protein that apparently has led to protein deficiencies when dependent on it as a home staple. Carbs. Nom. I would describe it as somewhere a cross between tasting like a parsnip and a potato. It's bland but the texture is really interesting.

I was starving today and had a hankering for some latin food so I though, ok, I'll give them one more chance to make amends (the first time the owner I spoke to on the phone was kinda horrible to me and the delivery took well over two hours). Maybe he was having a bad day that day, I dunno. Still doesnt excuse being not nice to me on the phone BUT im an understanding person and anyone can have a bad day IF they make up for it later.This time around they either saw my last review or something, because they were much nicer! The owner actually brought it himself I believe, apologizing if in the future they could not bring it when there's no driver to this area, and was super nice. AND the delivery was ahead of schedule. Im easy to please when given good customer service. All I want is an apology when shit doesnt go right. They did it, so Im retracting my prior bad review and giving them a good one for now because this was a much more pleasant experience and i'll keep this good review unless I get another bad one. For now I'll assume the bad experience I had the first time was a fluke.On the food-- its very good. I got mofongo camarones today (really delicious with a tomato sauce), maduros, rice pudding, etc. The pineapple soda is interesting.  It was all pretty darn good.

For $5.50, it doesn't get much better. The sandwich has some serious girth and full of roasted porky goodness. The sliced pickle was a little thinner than expected but I was still a fan from the first bite.The pernil was very flavorful and worth getting as well. It's offered as a special every day (which I find confusing - how is it special if it's offered daily?) and you can pick one rice selection (white, yellow or black) and one side order (yucca, frijoles, maduros or salad).  I went with the rice and black beans and it was great value for $7.50 ($6.50 before 3:00 pm).  Skip the chicken here. It's dry. Also, they don't have their own  hot sauce/ green sauce. That irked me but I let it slide since the store bought variety they do have is quite good.The icing on the cake here is that they are on Scout Mob so we got $10 off what was already a cheap meal.

We ordered the bread pudding and a vanilla pudding dessert that when eaten together was magical.  That is the part that stands out the most for me.  Also, they pile on SO MUCH rice it is almost comical.  I love rice but I can't eat 4 cups of it.  Okay, I probably could but I shouldn't.  We practically had to argue with the waiter to get him to charge us for our sodas.  They weren't part of the deal but he seemed to want to ignore that instead of having to bring us a bill.  He wanted to just not at all bring us a bill, have us tip him as we saw fit, and leave.  Weird.",3.0 star rating,"Pelham, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"deal,sites,deals,fiance,way,deal,rice,place,waiter,most,entree,choice,desserts,entrees,deals,deal,sides,case,some,things,bone thing,vanilla pudding dessert,space,part,empanadas,chump,items,something,steak,Nothing,sort,business,lamb,LINE,tables,deal,sodas,part,bill,bill,dessert,empanadas,bread pudding,most,movie theater","7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,2","0.195992693305,0.0995716303587,0.0875051766634,0.0857431441545,0.05832067132,0.0520309507847,0.0366150587797,0.0339655354619,0.0320841893554,0.0318734236062,0.0307355746627,0.0289327036589,0.01335527841,0.0121497549117,0.0115573881194,0.0108068231493,0.0106326295063,0.0106326295063,0.00852112378925,0.00815382786095,0.00810544472188,0.00809309538454,0.00793685298413,0.00763901090249,0.00739690847695,0.00713476072997,0.00713476072997,0.00711830379441,0.00711830379441,0.00710441870615,0.00709241302684,0.00709241302684,0.00709241302684,0.00649060728028,0.00608313642442,0.00502244289964,0.00480364216492,0.00379882915877,0.00326272123493,0.00326048536226,0.00266269268468,0.00242174649611,0.00241907592863,0.00241662166081,0.00211868924089"

Ever.  Seriously.  Hot coffee, cold coffee, latte..thank god Laurentino's is a mile away from me because I would be in trouble.  If you want iced with sugar instead of simple syrup, they use hot coffee to dilute it, simple and known concept but not many coffee places do that for you, unless you request it-which usually follows by a look of annoyance.  The cannolis are awesome, not ALWAYS the freshest, but it's a small business and turning over a batch of canollis isn't always as easy as people would hope...so I'm sympathetic.  The turnover I had was great, as were the cookies.  The apple pie and the chocolate covered strawberrys have caught my eye for some time now and are definitely next on my list.Perfect for coffee dates, reading, studying.  Do yourself a favor and make it down to Laurentino's!",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,6.69999980927,"review,Bakery,Cafe,people,Laurentino,service,Yelp,people,coffee,cannolis,coffee,Coffee,food,cold coffee,defense,place,coffee places,number,traffic,gem,pace,counter,Best,latte,trouble,people,syrup,sugar,concept,Lauentino,people,turnover,cookies,apple pie,strawberrys,chocolate,favor,eye,coffee dates,reading,annoyance,look,freshest,canollis,batch","7,2,2,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,3,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.130037918687,0.0886884406209,0.0886884406209,0.074403360486,0.0743538439274,0.0703890994191,0.052960973233,0.0405428186059,0.0264052469283,0.0227592736483,0.0177473779768,0.016418768093,0.0163527000695,0.0163449309766,0.0162100847811,0.0152788609266,0.011309213005,0.0112018827349,0.010952831246,0.0109219467267,0.0109219467267,0.0109219467267,0.0108967777342,0.0108265653253,0.0108265653253,0.0106070851907,0.0098967300728,0.0098967300728,0.0098967300728,0.00960802473128,0.0090979905799,0.00881236977875,0.0073807137087,0.00737378932536,0.00737378932536,0.00737378932536,0.00632842304185,0.00510653294623,0.00510653294623,0.00510653294623,0.00324541935697,0.00324541935697,0.00324184098281,0.00324184098281,0.001697897329"

Unfortunately, our experience was NOT the 4-5 star experience that we were expecting.Last night, we had just finished dinner at Monsignor's (5 star experience!) and decided it was a perfect opportunity to finally try Laurentino's since it was right across the street. We walked in & were the only patrons besides one other person, so they weren't busy at all. We had a few questions and the woman working behind the counter was able to answer them. I wouldn't say that she was rude, but she wasn't overly friendly either. We ended up ordering 1/4 pound of Pignoli cookies, a single piece of cherry pie, and a single serving of flan. She asked us if it was okay to put everything in a box and we agreed, and our bill came to $10. We arrived home and put the box directly into the fridge, but waited until today to dig in. We opened the box only to discover the flan was missing. So I figured this is an easily solvable issue. I'll just call them and tell them it's missing. Obviously the girl must've realized that she didn't give us the flan since it would've been just sitting there on the counter, right? Well I'm sorry to report that they did not offer us the missing flan or a refund, instead they questioned me for 4 minutes and then put me on hold for another 8 minutes until I finally gave up and hung up! I know a lot of you are probably thinking that I'm making a huge fuss over a $2-3 piece of flan, but it's not the money, it's the principle of it. I was a first time customer who paid good money to eat their product. It's bad enough that they took my money and failed to give me the product, but then to handle my complaint the way they just did is simply inexcusable! I've been working in the service industry myself for over 20 years and I would NEVER handle a complaint with an interrogation followed by putting a customer on hold until they hang up!

It is only $8 to $10 for a hookah - much cheaper than in Manhattan. And the hookah here lasts for a very long time.The food here was also very good. I had a mixed platter with lamb chops, sausage, and chicken kebab. All three of these were fresh, moist and tasty.

Well considering the Blue Mist was horrible, I'm going to say this lounge is horrible. They also have a very limited hookah menu.Another reason I am giving them 1 star is because of the 20% gratuity they add to your bill which is just ridiculous.

The hookah used to be great here, but I guess a lot has changed since my last visit. The hookah is absolutely flavorless and doesn't even pull too well.Another thing that disappointed me was the customer service. I asked the server what their policy was if I wasn't pleased with the hookah, and he basically said I would have to purchase a head change ($7). Every other hookah lounge on this planet will change your hookah if you're not pleased, but not this one.Lastly, they added a 20% tip to the bill, and when we questioned as to why isn't 15% the explanation just made me want to leave without saying a word. They basically said they charge $15 per head for those who do not order hookah. So they were doing us a ""favor"" by charging us a higher gratuity instead of the extra $15 per head. It was just my boyfriend and I, so we ordered one hookah, and most lounges require two people to get one hookah! Not every person should be required to get their own hookah.

The staff always check up on me to make sure if I need anything and that I'm comfortable. On the weekends, I meet up with a bunch of friends there and we always have a blast. I always end up making new friends every time I go there, too. The hookah here is top-notch and consistent. Every flavor that I've tried here so far is amazing. I tried orange mixed with some bubblegum recently and it was so good! My go-to is orange on an orange fruit. The food is also great! I love their burgers, especially the California burger because it has avocados. The falafel is so crispy and delicious.

Settled on this spot given the good reviews and preferable location.Not much going on inside, but the windows were open to let the nice weather in and a few TVs playing a soccer match. Looking through the menu, decided on the Guava-flavor Hookah ($12) and a Mango Smoothie ($7). Hookah is relatively smooth, a solid amount of coals though just a hint of guava flavor. Mango smoothie is thick; actually felt they used real mangoes to make it (for the price, was hoping so). Coals are refilled intermittently without burning the flavor.Was going to give four stars but had to take one off for the auto 20% gratuity.

Layaly Cafe,5440,4409 Broadway,Astoria,11103.0,195300,"Overall it's a decent place in an area where there are dozens of food options. In a nutshell, the 3 stars comes down to the following:Service: Excellent. Wait staff and the guys bringing new coals for the hookah are attentive and work really hard to give customers a positive experience. Polite, quick. We were seated outside in the back patio on a cold night in September because the dining room was full (mainly because it was a Saturday night and we were a party of six without a reservation). We didn't mind. It was a little chilly and we asked to be moved inside when a table came available. Eventually one did and we were moved inside, food and hookah and all. I thought that was nice of them.Hookah: Really good flavors, quick setup, decent prices. This is definitely the best part of the place. Ambiance: Not bad, not great. Smallish dining room, close quarters to other tables, but that's normal. Lots of TVs with soccer matches, baseball, football, etc.  Pretty standard stuff.Food: Not very good. I hate to say it, but it was actually kind of bad. I had a burger and it was basically one step up from a fast food burger. Thin and not much to it. Not particularly flavorful, either. We had some boneless wings that were pretty good but probably one step below Buffalo Wild Wings level (not that they are any great shakes). Some friends had dishes with mixed meats and rice that they said was good, so I'll say that they should probably drop the American junk food from the menu and stick with well-seasoned, thoughtful dishes that taste good. The food was without a doubt the most disappointing part of the night. That's why the place only gets 3 stars when everything else was good. It's a restaurant. Good food is important.Note: their drinks (juices and smoothies) are also quite good, but a little pricey. Would I go again? Probably not. But if you want to give it a shot, it's worth it for the hookah and some of the dishes.

The most notable aspect of Layali is that it is a very ""clean"" (haadi) place to be, lacking any trashy or sleazy  elements at all and a good place for people to hang out in a warm, easy going, secure environment.  .  Every time that I was there it was crowded so other people must like it as much as me.Being off the beaten track of the Arab quarter of Steinway gives it a kind of Oasis sensibility.  One wanders along the desolate street and finds it, ""feels nice, your out of the rain.""",4.0 star rating,"ASTORIA, NY",1,0,0.20000000298,2.79999995232,"aspect,maintenance,Shisha,taste,adjustments,coals,coal smoke,Coals,taste,place,people,elements,environment,track,sensibility,haadi,Layali,kind,street,rain,Arab,Steinway,Oasis,me.,people","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,1,3,3,7,1","0.244474574924,0.139149129391,0.0789008885622,0.0670809969306,0.0658095851541,0.0642130896449,0.0513108596206,0.0275398176163,0.0225500855595,0.017194353044,0.017194353044,0.0164427831769,0.0150522673503,0.0112306289375,0.0112306289375,0.00975154154003,0.00975154154003,0.00798149686307,0.00776684144512,0.00776684144512,0.00665570655838,0.00665570655838,0.00665570655838,0.00493306480348,0.00380663457327"

Layaly Cafe,5440,4409 Broadway,Astoria,11103.0,2809,"So I went here last night (Saturday night) around 11pm, and it was a pretty chill environment with only a couple of tables taken.  The weather was nice, so they opened up the front to the outside. I came here for three reasons: close enough to the Steinway hot spots, but far enough, so that it's quiet; the disposable hose per hookah; and the price.  I was pretty happy that we hit 2 of those 3.  Usually, hookah spots will just supply you with disposable tips, but Layaly unwraps a disposable plastic hose for each hookah, which may or may not be entirely necessary, but does make you feel better about sanitariness if that's important to you (it should be.)This was my first time, so I don't know if they have a late night/weekend menu, as the hookah prices were several dollars than seen in photos a Yelper posted (granted, the photo was from 2014.)  We chose to mix watermelon and mint ($3 mix charge, which is a $1 more than I usually see), and the base price for one regular flavor was $12.  The hookah pulled nicely and cleanly, though mint always overpowers whatever you mix it with, so it may or may not be worth the additional $.They have several TVs mounted on the walls, but they were all on the MEX v. CHI soccer ""match,"" and I have that in quotes because it wasn't a match at all as Mexico was humiliated 7-0.The front is a bit cramped as there's no real aisle space, but they do have a large annexed room in the back to fit even more patrons in.The service was great, and they changed our coals without prompt, but I made sure to ask for tongs from the get go, so I could keep an eye on them myself.We didn't eat anything, so we can't attest to the food though I can say that I nursed the absolute heck out of my $3 bottle of Snapple.I'll definitely be back!",4.0 star rating,"FLUSHING, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,3.70000004768,"chill environment,front,couple,tables,hookah,hookah spots,weather,hookah,outside,reasons,hose,watermelon,mint,patrons,hookah,price,TVs,hose,spots,base price,photo,photos,mint,time,menu,sanitariness,tips,mix charge,flavor,whatever,Steinway,service,aisle space,tongs,prompt,coals,back,room,Yelper,Layaly,hookah prices,get go,anything,food,heck,bottle,Snapple.,eye,front,match,match,quotes,soccer,walls,Mexico,MEX v.

Layla Jones,5441,214 Court St,Brooklyn,11201.0,1810,"Would we have ever set foot in Layla Jones if there hadn't been a 20-minute wait at Sam's one night? Probably not.  I don't know what the actual Layla Jones looks like, but the name does not conjure a pizza maker to me. Still, it was pizza and movie night, dammit, so we were getting a pizza one way or another, and if we didn't have time to wait for Sam, we'd settle for Layla. And I'm so very glad we did.  In some ways, I actually like the pizza here better. Their well-crafted square pies hold up under a big pile of top-notch extras without being tough. (My favorite so far is the ""big grande,"" which is red peppers, meatball, red onion, and sausage. I know that translates to ""big big"" and I don't care.) If what you want is traditional, round, greasy New York pizza, you might be disappointed, but if you look at it objectively as food, it will make your belly happy.  I think there's a place for both traditional pizza and trendy, toppinged pizza in the world. On our last trip we tried the pasta bowls and sandwiches, and they're even better than the pizza, if that's even possible. This is absolutely five-star food, no question. I've only got three problems with the place. First of all, they don't have a curtain up at the front door, so if you're eating there in the wintertime, be prepared to be blasted with cold air every time someone enters or leaves.

Unfortunately this will always be speculation and I'll never know for sure because I won't be back. I ordered pizza from them once based on their pretty solid review, and I have no bones to pick with the place other than the fact that their pizza isn't any good. It didn't take too long, the people were friendly, the price was good- great even, it was clean...everything was fine except for the food (for lack of a better word) they handed me.I brought it home and opened the box and had flashbacks to college in a really bad way. The crust was thick, soft, very pale, and tasted sweet, like there was butter and sugar in it or something. There might not be, but it tasted like it. The whole thing was pretty undercooked, so when I picked up one of the square slices everything fell off and I was barely successful at separating it from the rest and picking it up because it was so sloppy. I had to fold it in half so I could hold it with my other hand to keep the bottom from dropping off, and right when I bit into it, it started hemorrhaging orange liquid everywhere. I hear they have a garden so I'm throwing in an extra star. Plus the people were nice and, in their defense, I did only try one thing...coulda been an off night.

Always head to the back half, garden area. Choose a nice spring day, and relax in comfortable seats (choose the non-picnic table seating) and enjoy the fresh air with great foodAll the food served here is very solid and fairly priced paired with nice friendly service. Favorites here include the sweet sausage hero and the olive pizza. The sausage is well grilled, not overly salty, so can still taste the onions and peppers it's paired with. A bit greasy, to be expected with a sausage hero though. Counter that by eating it quickly so bread doesn't sog up. When looking for a calmer eating pace, order the various pizzas on offer. All the pizzas aren't salty or anything, can probably just assume all the sauces and cheeses universal to all the pizzas are well made with carefully selected ingredients. Usually opt for the olive pizza which also has arugula. Well baked, no topping are burnt, cheese with a good melt and crust has  a nice char to it. Another recommendation would be the sweet jane, based solely on the strength of the pesto sauce. They should really sell it on the side. Have also tried the pastas and paninis. Prefer the paninis over the pasta (sort of average, nothing stood out). The paninis are well pressed according to normal customer standards (I personally prefer it a bit burnt, so ask if you do too) and served with a side of salad. Tastes like the same mozzarella used on the pizzas, not a bad thing at all.

Slices are not too heavy but after a couple you are comfortable and grease here is minimal.  I usually grab a slice on my way home from work. Favorites include caramelized onions, chicken breast and plum tomatoes or the simple, fresh mozz topped off with some fresh basil and delicious sauce. Perfect ratios of ingredients!   If there are a few slices of cheese left and they are pulling out a new pie when you walk in they'll give you a slice from the fresh pie.  A pie fresh from their ovens here boarders on perfect.  The atmosphere is unpretentious and cute. It's a small place and its red color scheme makes it warm and cozy.  The staff here is some of the nicest you will find.  Other noteworthy dishes include: -Any of the grilled pizzas.

You know how it goes in the beginning...I'd give her $8, and she'd give me a sizable, delicious meatball parm hero for lunch. That's how they all start. Sometimes I'd go for the grilled chicken and goat cheese panini when I was feeling wild, and she'd throw in a drink too, because I'm a good listener.After the first couple trysts, we decided to go all the way. Pizza. She's into role playing (honeymoon phase, amirite guys?!)...sometimes she's Plain Jane (just sauce and cheese), and sometimes she spices it up as Sweet Jane (add a bit of pesto and romano). I'm not usually into dudes (not that there's anything wrong with that), but I gotta say...I like the meat. When Layla dresses up as Fast Eddie (pepperoni, meatballs and sausage) it's almost too much meat for me, but Sweet Lou and his lasagna combo (ricotta, meat sauce) is just right. This one time I got drunk and me, Eddie and Lou all got down together. I liked it...that stays between you and me though.To be up front though, Layla's not the best I've had in the city. Hell, she's not even the best in the 'hood (we live in a great area for slutty, delicious thin crust pies). But she's got that sauce and cheese and shapely crust (always a good combo). And she's always quick to come over when I call, and it's actually better that way. It's not that I'm embarrassed to be seen with her in public, it's just that her thicker, doughier crust doesn't lose as much (as a brick oven pie) in the box on the way over.If that sounds good to you, give Layla a call.

Layla Jones,5441,214 Court St,Brooklyn,11201.0,195416,"Okay, my Layla Jones take out experience this evening was so transformative, that I felt compelled, NAY - PROPELLED, to immediately and swiftly write this review. When it comes to pizza, for us there really is nothing better in the Heights. Don't even bother telling me about Grimaldi's... I don't even care. I am so in love with the mushroom pizza from Layla Jones that it's truly my go-to pizza joint. The sauce is mad fresh, the mushrooms are perfectly cooked, and the crust is so magically crunchy/chewy that it's just really the perfect pizza, in my book. ENTER THIS GAME-CHANGING EVENING... Already content with LJ's pizza-tastic offerings, we decided to try their pasta. I am not kidding when I tell you that I am still thrashing around in ecstasy, drooling and gently moaning about the Sweet Sausage and Penne pasta dish that I only finished savoring moments ago... From the moment that the take out bag arrived on my kitchen counter, I could smell the majesty and regal splendor that was waiting inside. I dove right in and let me just say that every ingredient that these people use is top notch, first rate, world class deliciousness, and when combined, it just feels like you took bath salts, but without the cocaine psychosis that comes afterwards. I've just never in my life had anything so delicious. We've always loved their sauce, but eating it on pasta was like getting a back massage and a hundred thousand dollar raise at the same time. It was unbelievable. You know how some low quality sausage has little bits of gristle and nasty $h!t in it that is the direct result of not thoroughly mixing the ingredients?? Not LJ's sausage!

Not only was it light (and filling) it had this slight buttery taste that was so tasty with the pepperoni. I immediately felt ashamed I hadn't even bothered to try this place. I'm currently giving it 4 stars because I haven't eaten anything else but it's edging past that. definitely check it. It looks like they do mostly Sicilian but not the high doughy kind.

Layla Jones,5441,214 Court St,Brooklyn,11201.0,85268,"We just ate dinner in the garden last night--we got one of the meal specials, with salad, pasta, pizza and jello and I really have no complaints, sort of. The atmosphere in the garden is very relaxed. It's totally fine to take two small children on a Saturday after 8 PM without feeling like you're stepping on anyone's toes or invading adult space.I'm really waffling on this review though because Layla Jones has quickly become a neighborhood institution, and the owners have sold their personalities and community rootedness as much as their food. And I like the owners. And I like the garden. And we've been to three or four birthday parties there in the last couple of years. And we've ordered take-out, too, on occasion. On the one hand, I would give the owners a 5 for being awesome. But this is the hard part. Most of the time, the pizza is reliably fine. Especially if it's ordered for delivery. Perhaps because it has time to cool a bit in transit so the toppings adhere to the crust.  But last night, the pizza crust was soggy, there was too much sauce under the cheese and the cheese slid off the crust so my two year old was covered in tomato and grease. The pasta was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was very, very sweet. The salad was mostly mixed greens, and my brother who's visiting from Memphis remarked that we were paying a lot to eat something we had in our fridge - bare mixed greens with a tablespoon of chopped tomatoes and light dressing.We had a long day yesterday and came home late with no enthusiasm for making dinner. This is when living in Brooklyn is great. We can walk four blocks and find 25 different restaurants where they don't mind feeding children a little later than dinner time. We could have stayed home and made spaghetti and salad in the same amount of time it took to walk to Layla Jones and order and wait for our dinner to be served, but then we'd have to clean up afterward, and it's nice to get out when the days are long. Anyway. I am rambling. I wish the salad was a little more...more. That is all. I hate to pay extra to not have to clean up afterward and then feel like I could have done better at home.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,11.3000001907,"dinner,salad,garden,pizza,pasta,owners,meal specials,jello,complaints,one,children,sauce,garden,part,atmosphere,brother,Layla Jones,owners,neighborhood institution,pizza,personalities,community rootedness,food,review,adult,anyone,toes,pizza crust,salad,bit,owners,garden,crust,Most,restaurants,birthday parties,crust,cheese,greens,cheese,tomato,pasta,occasion,take-out,hand,delivery,toppings,transit,dinner,salad,grease,lot,children,home,salad,order,amount,spaghetti,all,Memphis,more,dinner,home,home,tomatoes,greens,enthusiasm,tablespoon,something,blocks,Brooklyn","7,7,2,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,1,1,1,3,6,1,7,7,5,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,7,2,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,2","0.0627167895436,0.0627167895436,0.058345053345,0.058345053345,0.053148124367,0.0466838851571,0.0465884879231,0.0465884879231,0.0465884879231,0.039363052696,0.0294529944658,0.0286131985486,0.0279674604535,0.0273760594428,0.0272649955004,0.0239763800055,0.0143809728324,0.0108973346651,0.00963487662375,0.0086872568354,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.00848967861384,0.0084420517087,0.00829994119704,0.00813350453973,0.00739001715556,0.00734059605747,0.00707815866917,0.00691520329565,0.00676576886326,0.00649529276416,0.00647119944915,0.00643200380728,0.00625978084281,0.00588631769642,0.00588631769642,0.00588079495355,0.00567236216739,0.00567236216739,0.00566277559847,0.00563997868448,0.00563376583159,0.00563376583159,0.00518307555467,0.00518307555467,0.00515046902001,0.00514113996178,0.00438347039744,0.00438029645011,0.00427757157013,0.00383249437436,0.00383249437436,0.00383249437436,0.00328336912207,0.00304414983839,0.00302706821822,0.00293702236377,0.00264531141147,0.00192590884399,0.00192590884399,0.00192590884399,0.00168489513453,0.00168489513453,0.00168489513453,0.0016822227044,0.000996405840851"

It more shaped like a chicken roll but larger. They cover the outer top with cheese and bake it. The whole thing is very crunchy and crispy. It's a nice variation of a calzone.

Layla Jones,5441,214 Court St,Brooklyn,11201.0,2258,"1.5 stars...The Sweet Jane pizza at Layla Jones has the unique distinction of being the worst pizza I've ever had. Their margherita pizza also has the title of one of the worst of that variety I've ever had as well. Their pizza's are square with 8 slices. The sweet jane ($17) is described has having  homemade sauce, whole milk mozzarella, fresh pesto and imported romano. Loving margherita pizza I thought this seemed like an interesting twist with basil pesto instead of whole basil leaves. What I got was droopy soggy slices of pizza with an insane amount of garlic. I couldn't even get a hint of what any part of the pizza tasted like because of the amount of garlic on it.Giving them the benefit of the soubt I went back a couple days later and got a slice of their margherita pizza ($3.25). Sad that a slice without basil is $2.50. It's 75 cents for a topping whether that topping is sausage or some chopped up basil leaves. To their defense, and the only reason I rounded up to 2 stars, is that the basil is fresh and they give you a lot of it (too much actually).

Layla Jones,5441,214 Court St,Brooklyn,11201.0,23404,"I have ordered delivery from here several times. I always get these personal sized grilled pizzas. So far I have had: sausage, ricotta, peppers;  grilled veg. w/ goat cheese; and finally the mushrooms and spinach.The Sausage pizza did not travel well at all. The peppers made the whole crust super soggy. I put the pizza back in the oven at 250 for awhile tho, and it helped to crisp it back up (not totally). Some slices were totally soaked thru and others were fine.   I really liked the idea of this pizza, so the next time, I asked for it without the peppers. I loooooveed it ! I loved the creaminess of the ricotta, saltiness of the sausage, and sweetness of the caramelized onions. I could eat this everyday. My only complaint was that without the peppers it felt slightly (sliiiiightly) dry. I tried to order this again, but was told that they cooked the onions, peppers, and sausage all together and could not eliminate the peppers. ::sigh:: That is the end of that pizza for me.The next one i tried was the mushroom/spinach . It was good, not great. felt dry. plus the crust (on all) are a little cardboardy.. I needed something to really make this pop for me. If you like goat cheese, you'll like the grilled vegetable pizza. They put squash, egpplant, mushrooms, and other veggies. Yumm...feels healthy with all those veggies. My only complaint would be the goat cheese distribution varies, so sometimes it feels like more is needed.

When I put the growlers up on the bar to have them filled, the bartender seemed kind of confused that I wanted to use my own, instead of the ones they had available behind the bar, but he filled them and we went on with our night.When round 2 came along, my friend takes our growlers back to the bar and a different bartender gives her this look as if no patron has ever brought in their own growler before, then walks away to talk to a manager. After pointing and giggling at my friend with the manager over the bar, she comes back and says ""I can't fill those...we have to use our own."" My friend mentions that they had been filled earlier and that it wasn't a problem, to which the bartender replied that the other bartender was told he couldn't do that anymore. Apparently she was being kind of rude about it, too, but I wasn't there so I can't really say. They gave us their own growlers and we went on with our evening (with two big, unused growlers taking up space on the table next to the in-house ones).It's not a giant deal or anything, and as I mentioned everything else about the place was really nice, but why even have a growler promotion if you aren't letting customers bring their own? That's the whole point of growlers...and if that's your policy, fine, but it should probably be made clearer on the website that outside growlers aren't permitted so customers aren't dragging giant glass jugs out to the bar with them if they don't have to.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.300000011921,5.30000019073,"beer,friend,everything,meat/cheese plate,growlers,cheese/meat plate,music,atmosphere,policy,growler,bartender,place,Growler,fact,bartender,growlers,customers,customers,bar,growlers,growler,patron,website,home,bar,bar,bar,bartender,bartender,manager,ones,manager,round,problem,growlers,growlers,ones,place,growlers,look,deal,anything,growler promotion,bar,growlers,website,jugs,glass,space,table","6,1,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,7,1,4,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7","0.158086061478,0.119760803878,0.0754855051637,0.0639842972159,0.0494975149632,0.0486031845212,0.042610745877,0.042610745877,0.0407374761999,0.0366222299635,0.0282660480589,0.023292530328,0.0217875465751,0.0203974768519,0.0163658093661,0.0140039231628,0.0118981646374,0.011124975048,0.0111122783273,0.0109757455066,0.00943075772375,0.00924351532012,0.0089258775115,0.00777144962922,0.00750815402716,0.00750815402716,0.00748698227108,0.00707096233964,0.00643824692816,0.00597665971145,0.00597665971145,0.00595979671925,0.00578734325245,0.00507281254977,0.0044230860658,0.0044230860658,0.00405150698498,0.00405150698498,0.00390254706144,0.00371472164989,0.00354487355798,0.00354487355798,0.00354487355798,0.00352007918991,0.00280698062852,0.00280124228448,0.00245081447065,0.00245081447065,0.001833615941,0.0015549340751"

Fast forward to this past weekend, when a group of ten of us went to Lavender Lake to have dinner and drinks with a mutual friend visiting from the west coast. Again, we went for the amazing backyard and new service would be a little slow, but we were in no rush. The waiter took a while to get our drink orders, not making it fully around the table and then took a long time coming back with drinks. He asked if we wanted separate tabs, so we split off into couples (we were mostly couples in our 30s) and wrote our names down on the tab he handed us (per his direction) to indicate which orders belonged to which cards. We then ordered food and specified our card for each order. After a very long time and no food, our waiter came back and tried to deliver the food from another table to ours multiple times. At this point we laughed it off. Finally our food arrived and we ate, and our waiter never checked on us again. We were there for about 2 hours. When a different waitress brought our checks, all of them contained at least one or two duplicated items or items we did not order. We found the waitress and she corrected the numbers and disappeared. We waited. A while later another waitress appeared. She proceeded to accuse us of stealing food, saying that she could not possibly understand how the orders were incorrect. We told her we had written down our original orders and given the list to our waiter (who we had not seen in over two hours) and she quickly dismissed this saying that he was gone and the list was gone too. Ok....so we were at a stand still. I asked if we could clear this up by talking to a manager. She replied that she WAS the manager (WHAT?!). She continued to repeat that she could just not understand how this happened and that she wasn't accusing us of being dishonest but this just was not possible. When we confronted her by saying that she in fact WAS accusing us of being dishonest, she somewhat backed down and disappeared for a while. When she returned she removed a few things from our checks arbitrarily (I guess a nice gesture, but we were happy to pay for what we ordered!) and showed them to us before she ran our credit cards. We agreed, though we were so baffled and exhausted at this point, and she left to go run the cards. After quite a while (about 20 minutes) she returned and ignored us as she started clearing tables and taking other tables' orders. We flagged her down and asked her what was going on and she said they were busy inside and it was going to take a while to run our cards. Ok. Finally she came back with our cards, said nothing, and left. I have NEVER not left a tip in my life until that day. And I was so horrified that a manager would treat customers that way that I will never ever go back to this restaurant. It is a shame that such lovely real estate is being squandered by such poor (and frankly, insultingly awful) management.  If you want to have a pleasant evening, there are plenty of other fantastic restaurants and bars in the area that I would feel good about supporting. I cannot say the same of this place unfortunately.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,-0.20000000298,18.2999992371,"life,waiter,waiter,backyard,Lavender Lake,service experience,waitress,food,food,checks,drinks,service,dinner,waitress,burger,salt,sweet potato chips,fiancee,drink orders,shame,service,orders,drinks,table,drinks,group,cards,dinner,backyard,food,food,food,food,couples,food,orders,cards,card,order,friend,coast,rush,tabs,all,restaurants,table,times,manager,manager,orders,couples,point,items,items,list,direction,tab,names,numbers,tables,tables,saying,stand,point,list,orders,manager,management,nothing,tip,things,restaurant,cards,way,real estate,bars,area,same,place,credit cards,plenty,customers,fact,gesture","7,1,1,2,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,2,7,4,1,1,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7","0.153816670179,0.0702845528722,0.0638603046536,0.0587850250304,0.0362500920892,0.0350112244487,0.0284202471375,0.0263155549765,0.026181275025,0.0259177610278,0.0225540883839,0.0209605898708,0.019070520997,0.0187427122146,0.01669135876,0.01669135876,0.01669135876,0.01669135876,0.0122391013429,0.0103013040498,0.0096999257803,0.00857530068606,0.00854881945997,0.00850502960384,0.00850502960384,0.00814466830343,0.00734373973683,0.00722502917051,0.00720463227481,0.0066799079068,0.00666994648054,0.00666994648054,0.00665300851688,0.00664792116731,0.00661641266197,0.00640324316919,0.00640324316919,0.00639241794124,0.00639241794124,0.00632163695991,0.00632163695991,0.00630378723145,0.00627696700394,0.00607206206769,0.00572936283424,0.00571307959035,0.00524121383205,0.00517541402951,0.0051722144708,0.00507703935727,0.00484335096553,0.00482150306925,0.00480549503118,0.00480549503118,0.00437934882939,0.0042374827899,0.0042374827899,0.0042374827899,0.00420040963218,0.00385368289426,0.00385368289426,0.00383147550747,0.00382885010913,0.00325804506429,0.00310984184034,0.00274248397909,0.00266199116595,0.00266091967933,0.0026365625672,0.00250507402234,0.00238202326,0.00224933656864,0.00217209453695,0.00196782266721,0.00196703034453,0.0019662627019,0.0019662627019,0.00196551834233,0.00196551834233,0.00189021776896,0.00184543651994,0.00148865568917,0.00125115434639,0.00125047902111"
Lavender Lake,5442,383 Carroll St,Brooklyn,11231.0,10714,"Gowanus aches to have its swaths of flat space and low lying warehouses utilized just as much as the dolphin that perished in the nearby pestilential canal had hoped to be saved by the EPA. Lavender Lake is one of the places that tries to answer the call of the idle wild. However, I would not expose myself to the bridge over the canal (by the way, currently only accessible from Union Street and not Carroll anyway) to go there again.Basically, if it wasn't before, it's a huge scene now; every seat taken by a  spacey 30 or 40-something hipster who on sight makes you depressed about your own life. The beautiful bar is staked out at all sides by couples; the kind that live in brownstones just up the hill in Carroll Gardens. There are spaces in between them but no opportunity for seating, and even when you meekly poke your head through to get something super simple like a 'gansett (which, by the way, isn't served in its signature tallboy can but is drafted into a pint glass), you get ignored by about seven bartenders of equal gender distribution. One, however, who is probably new to the line and trying to hold onto his job, finally looks you in the eye and jumps to give you your goddamn light beer.The back of the large, low-ceilinged spot is thrown open to an outdoor seating area from where the last light of day beckons. Outside, there is an upper tier with the noise level of a Williamsburg beer garden. Down below, there are Adirondak chairs and simple wooden folding chairs arranged around a few low, little tables. The space is ample, but the seats are all taken, and inquiring after one visibly chair gets faux apologies from scrunch faced hipsters with dull hair and bright lipstick who are apparently saving the spots for their imaginary friends, because, as you and your own friend resort to a spot on a bench near a wet bucket full of cigarette butts and one broke-backed folding chair, on one ever shows up once to sit in the empty seat). Furthermore, as you have your four dollar (fair enough) 'gansett and your friend sips her odd tasting $12 lemony vodka drink out of a tumbler, a disgruntled worker blows by you to open a door in a high wooden fence right into your back, then does the same thing on the way back in even as you're scrambling to get out of his way...not looking at you once.It's kind of a shame because the orientation of the space gives a sense of freedom and intimacy all at once, but on the ground where we must dwell, there's a film of grime over everything; the deck, the cement floor, the chairs, the tables...all inspiring an undue amount of itchiness. We know that this city is old and has a lotttt of dirt, but we'd have gone to Bushwick if we wanted to revel ironically in filth rather than transcend it.All the while, we could smell the $11 (+$1 for each add-on of cheese, bacon, avocado, etc.) burgers roasting (definitely not the fragrance of medium rare or rare) on the grill inside. I'd arrived wanting to try out the ""LL Burger,"" but then wasn't sure how to do so what with no servers around and our credit cards lying about at the bar....and having just found our hard earned and unsatisfying seats, we were not in the mood to get up and find out.The bathrooms were paradoxically clean and charming, but after being notified of the $10 card minimum and combining our tabs, it was a quick last stop before we ran out towards a much better outdoorsy establishment in the neighborhood (namely, Gowanus Yacht Club, separate review). Maybe brunch here would be good, but I have a feeling it'd be just as crowded and that you might as well stick with Littleneck (separate review).",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",4,0,-0.20000000298,6.69999980927,"scene,canal,dolphin,way,Union Street,space,gansett,places,aches,swaths,lying warehouses,one,dollar,chairs,Gowanus,EPA,hipster,wild,call,bridge,friend,hipsters,Lavender Lake,Carroll,seat,seating,something,stop,spaces,door,brunch,bar,kind,space,seats,life,sight,sides,couples,brownstones,hill,head,opportunity,folding chairs,chair,seat,folding chair,spot,spot,spots,friends,way,way,light,back,beer garden,tables,Littleneck,back,gansett,seats,Carroll Gardens,signature tallboy,pint glass,bartenders,gender distribution,line,job,seating area,eye,noise level,apologies,cigarette butts,scrunch,hair,lipstick,friend resort,bench,bucket,fence,worker blows,thing,tumbler,vodka drink,tasting,All,light,burgers,bar,credit cards,LL Burger,ground,grill,fragrance,avocado,bacon,cheese,add-on,servers,Williamsburg,Adirondak,review,orientation,establishment,card minimum,neighborhood,mood,feeling,space,city,tables,cement floor,deck,everything,grime,film,intimacy,freedom,amount,itchiness,shame,dirt,filth,lotttt,Gowanus Yacht Club,tabs,sense,bathrooms,Bushwick","7,2,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,6,2,3,1,7,7,2,1,1,3,1,7,7,7,2,2,7,4,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,5,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,2,2","0.116793975234,0.0936542004347,0.0623186156154,0.0616138614714,0.0357580035925,0.0333593115211,0.0314667150378,0.0299013182521,0.0247245077044,0.0247245077044,0.0247245077044,0.0197397600859,0.0164476018399,0.016443811357,0.0146771948785,0.0146771948785,0.0130336126313,0.0117888161913,0.0117888161913,0.0117285428569,0.00872636958957,0.008685127832,0.00855490379035,0.00794305745512,0.00677025038749,0.00672660162672,0.00655592186376,0.00655191252008,0.00565171381459,0.00561484508216,0.0053742765449,0.00510326540098,0.00510326540098,0.00494232168421,0.00450845947489,0.00448150699958,0.00448150699958,0.00446520047262,0.00446520047262,0.00446520047262,0.00446520047262,0.00445259315893,0.00445259315893,0.0042916117236,0.00428521120921,0.00412577437237,0.00392145244405,0.00376862357371,0.00374930677935,0.00374930677935,0.00374930677935,0.00368786882609,0.00368786882609,0.00342776160687,0.00342776160687,0.00342107075267,0.00341528537683,0.00316768721677,0.0031164707616,0.0031164707616,0.00307126785628,0.0030217722524,0.00300592696294,0.00300592696294,0.00300592696294,0.00300592696294,0.00299898744561,0.00299898744561,0.00299898744561,0.00299898744561,0.00299313268624,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.00298361200839,0.0027266019024,0.0027266019024,0.0027266019024,0.0027266019024,0.0027266019024,0.0027266019024,0.0025567386765,0.00243420270272,0.00232540792786,0.00232284376398,0.00232284376398,0.0022834057454,0.00227750884369,0.00203443691134,0.00203443691134,0.00203443691134,0.00203443691134,0.00203443691134,0.00203443691134,0.00203219335526,0.00177182652988,0.00176882860251,0.00160807487555,0.00146476528607,0.00140682153869,0.00140682153869,0.00140682153869,0.00140682153869,0.00140539405402,0.0012082856847,0.00109281460755,0.00102094991598,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000893155462109,0.000892076292075,0.000892076292075,0.000892076292075,0.000832617108244,0.000709175947122,0.000634121126495,0.000609030015767,0.000527933763806"

Lavendar Lake, what is your deal?  I wanted to love this place, it had all the right workings of a great venue.  Great buzz, a write-up in the Times, out of the way locale, outdoor space... but what is it that makes you barely a three star establishment....I hope the owners take note, because LL really has the makings to be a superb place.  The space is very large - has a long hall, almost beer hall atmosphere in the indoor portion and a lovely welcoming patio/ garden in the back.  Food is excellent and reasonably priced - I recommend you go  double B and get an order of the burger and fried brussels sprouts, yum.  Now sadly, the drawbacks....  the service is truly horrendous.  Each of the servers act like chickens with their heads cut off.  Running around with food, walking back with it, not knowing which table they belong to, talking to each other at random times about which table they should bring food/ drinks to, and generally looking confused.  The servers don't even know what tables they service, since people tend to mingle.  We ended up asking three different servers for things, because we had no idea who had placed order because three different servers asked us three different things.  My suggestion would be to just have the servers deal with the food, and have patrons get their drinks from the bar - in which case double the bartenders OR use a number on a stick system (a la Pork Slope), so that the servers can correspond tables to patrons to food.  Also, they ran out of food  or had some kind of ""kitchen mishap"" at 8pm, not sure what that's about, but seriously shape up LL managers/ owners - you can do a lot better than this!",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.10000000149,8.0,"space,place,patrons,deal,Lavendar Lake,workings,venue,write-up,buzz,locale,way,servers,Times,each other,owners,place,Each,service,Food,note,servers,food,star establishment,makings,order,food,table,tables,drawbacks,hall,servers,table,food,back,patio,garden,portion,beer hall atmosphere,B,burger,brussels sprouts,drinks,chickens,heads,tables,drinks,patrons,food,bar,case,bartenders,number,stick system,owners,servers,servers,kind,kitchen mishap,managers,lot,food,Pork Slope,people,servers,things,suggestion,order,things,LL,idea","2,7,1,7,2,7,2,4,7,7,7,7,3,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7","0.120547547936,0.0949782580137,0.0570446923375,0.0372485592961,0.0341689325869,0.0299231037498,0.0299231037498,0.0298148971051,0.0298148971051,0.0298148971051,0.0298148971051,0.0252886116505,0.0202171709388,0.0191737152636,0.0178978666663,0.0159741379321,0.0157959070057,0.0147966444492,0.0141888642684,0.013291570358,0.0120658334345,0.011530155316,0.0114196864888,0.0114196864888,0.011295620352,0.0105528049171,0.01032188721,0.0099240783602,0.00937852542847,0.00878975167871,0.00821156986058,0.00811518728733,0.00785837695003,0.00769135821611,0.00769135821611,0.00769135821611,0.00769135821611,0.00769135821611,0.00767361978069,0.00767361978069,0.00767361978069,0.00765895424411,0.0076457131654,0.0076457131654,0.00703419279307,0.00685877213255,0.00594488717616,0.0054368483834,0.00520152598619,0.00520152598619,0.00520152598619,0.00520152598619,0.00520152598619,0.00411237636581,0.00360757042654,0.00360359321348,0.00359794660471,0.00359794660471,0.00359794660471,0.00359794660471,0.00344842299819,0.00307958619669,0.00298474240117,0.00287145772018,0.00285325408913,0.00279491930269,0.00261090998538,0.00261090998538,0.00243447558023,0.00228419410996"

Cocktails were all delicious, so you can't go wrong if you start at the top of the list, and work your way down.  On the other hand, their beer repertoire is not as impressive, with few beers and no ciders, although they serve their beers in cider glasses at times (what a tease).VALUE: Pretty standard for the area, especially for bars of their appeal, and attempting to be of this caliber.  OVERALL:  You can't just be a bar with a patio and serve beer to call yourself a ""beer garden"".  Although the food is fantastic, outside is charming, makes you feel like you're in the Old World, I think they are still green, and are trying just a bit too hard at being high end in this desolate section of Gowanus.

I was really excited to try the drinks since they were all made with such unique ingredients - cardamom bitters, curry salt, lavender syrup, etc. I ordered Into The Void, which the bartender told me they were out of something called amaro so he was going to sub for Fernet Branca. I should have known better than to say yes because I already knew Fernet Branca is the grossest drink on the planet but I was hoping his genius combination of ingredients would help me understand why people like it. It didn't. The drink was so bad I wanted to ask for a different one but didn't want to be rude - I was forewarned so it was my bad. My friends ordered the Electric Funeral, which was okay but nothing that exciting, and another friend ventured for the Sweet Leaf which intriguingly had curry salt on the rim. This sounds nice in theory but in practice, it was weird even for me with an adventurous palate. The food was a different story for me though - delicious! We ordered the lobster roll, crispy duck breast and braised short rib, which was a special that night. The lobster roll was a bit small, as expected for most lobster rolls in New York. Really tasty though, and the white sweet potato fries and spicy garlic aioli it came with were a nice accompaniment. The duck breast was perfectly crispy on the outside but fork tender on the inside, sitting atop a deliciously creamy truffled beet risotto. An unlikely combination that worked so well. The short rib was tender and smoky.

Not necessarily a place I'd linger for more than an hour or so, but definitely a worthy stop for a starter or a night cap. I wouldn't be opposed to popping back in if I was in the area, although there's not much surrounding it and I'm not entirely sold on it being a destination kind of place.Nevertheless, their Hard Ball cocktail is just as good as any drink I've had at Manhattan's Death & Co, and far less of a fuss to get to, so I'm a fan!",4.0 star rating,"San Francisco, CA",2,1,0.5,2.5,"fan,Lavender Lake,little,cocktail,ambience,smooov,no-frills bar,crowds,series,dead space,destination kind,Manhattan,list,whisk,conjunction,staff,bar,drink,cocktails,relief.,date,Hard Ball,cocktail,place,rocks,vermouth,rye,heart,quality,prices,action,back,tables,area,drink,fuss,stop,starter,night cap,Death & Co","1,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,2,7,6,7,1,2,7,7,7,4,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,2,1,7,4","0.516366839409,0.114074021578,0.0746286660433,0.0424001514912,0.0339505746961,0.0339505746961,0.0195518638939,0.0130988024175,0.012147186324,0.0114067485556,0.00806783977896,0.00662293750793,0.00627498095855,0.00627498095855,0.00627498095855,0.00627498095855,0.00590108986944,0.00556826964021,0.00529875000939,0.00523075461388,0.00451751565561,0.00449921516702,0.00441056489944,0.00439627468586,0.00424067629501,0.00424067629501,0.00424067629501,0.00424067629501,0.00421898206696,0.00396038359031,0.00386142521165,0.00386142521165,0.00386142521165,0.00286751263775,0.00226976419799,0.00198599044234,0.00126198015641,0.00126198015641,0.00126198015641,0.00117588590365"

Unfortunately, Lavender Lake generally fails this trend, as the meal I had was a massive disappointment. When we arrived at Lavender Lake, we were recommended to start off with the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer. This was the highlight of the meal, as the entree I ordered was a disappointment. Wanting to see what their burger . However when it came out, the first bite was unpalatable, and the subsequent ones did not improve.

That backyard was just too alluring to pass on.Well, the service was even worse than I'd expected. Can't tell you about the food and drinks, as we never got that far.It wasn't mean, screw-you style service. Just, well, depressing in a 1970s Soviet Union knowingly incompetent sort of way. Of the ""We know that we don't know what the hell we're doing. We know that *you* know that we don't know what the hell we're doing. So let's not even bother even trying to fake it--we're not going to serve you well, and you will be unhappy with your experience"".Which was accurate. We ordered drinks and a few snacks on a Sunday night that was getting busy, but wasn't super crowded yet. It only took two waves to get the server to come by. She managed to take the order and my card for a tab, though none of this went smoothly. She disappeared for 45 minutes, after which I went up the register and asked her for my card back, as we were going to leave. Well, she did tell me that our drinks were ready (our now flat beers were sitting there, unserved, on the bar). But no apology--like this was all expected, all as intended. Manager was no better.

Whether it's for dinner (delicious, see below) or birthday parties this place gets mostly high marks all around: from food to ambiance to the crowd. Compared with bars and restaurants in adjacent Carroll Gardens, this place is simply huge - but its real asset is the large but charming patio out back. Walk through the large bar area, and past the kitchen and seating area and you'll come to a deck outside. Continue down the stairs and you'll find a charming patio with market lights overhead and movies projected on an adjacent wall. While the flood line from Hurricane Sandy is memorialized in paint, you'd never know that this place looked like anything other than paradise.The food and drink here are delicious, and they get high marks for serving my favorite summer tipple: Lambrusco.  The smoked almonds are perfect to snack on if you aren't in for a meal, but you're doing yourself a disservice if you miss out on the brussels sprouts. They are simply outstanding. The mains fare well also, with the salmon, chicken and short rib being stand outs over the past year.Service when dining is attentive for the most part, though I've encountered more than one overwhelmed server. The upside? One time, the kitchen had supposedly run out of our most coveted entree and the waiter helpfully suggested alternatives before surprising us by bringing the originally ordered dish. The service on a busy night can be iffy as exemplified by one recent visit when I asked for a large ice water three times and never received it.All in all, however, this is a great spot and even when busy doesn't feel overwhelmingly crowded.

I try and live by that, as it keeps me from disappointing everyone around me [more than I already do]. On the flip side, I also try not to go into anything with out-sized expectations, and that includes bars and restaurants. In the Age of the Internet, this isn't easy, and I suppose I'm partly to blame. So when I walked into Lavender Lake, I admit I'd read a few reviews, and was expecting a few things: great cocktails, a spacious dining area, a beautiful backyard...which they certainly lived up to. What I wasn't expecting was to be absolutely floored by their food. Yes, the snacks are amazing: the housemade chips are addictive and the fried brussels sprouts and their lemon aioli have ruined me for all other brussels sprouts. The kale salad was also excellent, and the burger smells incredible (and by all accounts, tastes the same). But I am all about the pan-seared chicken and its marsala demi-glace...LEGIT. I ate this thing, from first bite to gnawing on the bone, in complete disbelief. We planned to share, so reluctantly I gave my lady friend the smallest bites I possibly could (which turned out to be fine because she was doing the same exact thing with her beautifully braised shortrib and its accompanying parsnip puree). This dish has singlehandedly changed my mind about not ordering chicken when I eat out, and it will make it very, very difficult for me to get that burger next time.

Lavender Lake,5442,383 Carroll St,Brooklyn,11231.0,195584,"I recently hosted a party at lavender lake and had a great experience!! The place has a cozy and relaxed ambiance with a great outdoor space.  Reserving the space was easy. They did not need a card to hold a party reservation. They also provide a party menu for parties greater than 15 people.  The food is great, way better than your average pub food.  I highly recommend the brussel sprouts and burgers. The staff was friendly and attentive. Our waitress was able to manage multiple tabs with no problem.  She stayed on top of our food and drink orders and kept on top with the flow events throughout the night. She helped me light candles and bringing out a birthday cake. I will say, that I probably benefited from having the party on slow Tuesday night, although, I am confident things would of still flowed just as smoothly if there were a couple more folks at the bar. The waitress was sweet and helpful. In my opinion, a person with a  good disposition goes a long way, especially, when hosting others. She really made the difference. The management was really helpful too. They helped reconcile my bill when something was off. No fuss.  They just wanted to help. I highly recommend.

Nor do I regret it.  That cheese on my sandwich was amazing.  They underestimated my love for cheese.  But also forgot the power of one's review in our day and age.  This is my first one star review.  Whomever had a chuckle or laugh thinking they took me for a fool or got their silly way....uh huh.  It cost them much more I believe and I still enjoyed my sandwich.  I hope he or she can swallow this 1 star just as pleasantly.  PS- we appropriately still tipped our sweet waitress %20 and the sandwich was about $13 if anyone was wondering",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,12.6000003815,"urgency,sandwich,Lavander lake,waitress,idea,food,reason,chef,friend,backyard area,decor,managers incompetence,rating,two,star review,items,chicken sandwich,One,food,menu,friends,sandwiches,sandwich,beach,drinks,hers,waitress,waitress,slice,menu,cheese,slice,slice,chef,sort,waitress,form,count,inventory,dish,sandwich,one,review,love,power,age,chuckle,fool,cheese,star,way,anyone,PS,waitress %,form,people,nerve","7,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,3,7,7,1,7","0.368365347385,0.125854760408,0.101707719266,0.0544734708965,0.0223125107586,0.020319936797,0.0177944805473,0.0166120175272,0.0165519025177,0.0151828369126,0.0146191688254,0.0145445987582,0.0145445987582,0.0144919203594,0.0130957625806,0.0100481603295,0.00906906928867,0.00691683031619,0.00633689714596,0.00631902646273,0.00629217503592,0.00609083194286,0.00608175853267,0.00554529298097,0.00552964955568,0.00550614483654,0.00530845159665,0.00510496506467,0.00464507285506,0.0045129135251,0.00440193526447,0.00425097206607,0.00424198666587,0.00423597218469,0.00394352013245,0.00387242482975,0.00385850784369,0.003701467067,0.003701467067,0.003701467067,0.0033954649698,0.00315242120996,0.00286732288077,0.00251031760126,0.00250868592411,0.00250868592411,0.00250565703027,0.00250565703027,0.00230818265118,0.00198070402257,0.00184833980165,0.00173198652919,0.00161837670021,0.00132706295699,0.00126226863358,0.00117659254465,0.00110429548658"

The food is way better than you'd expect, particularly the brussels sprouts. But, if you want to try to arrange a party or event at Lavender Lake, be prepared to be very disappointed. I tried to reserve several tables a few weeks in advance of an event. Since I work down the block, I stopped by in the afternoon and was told to email parties@lavenderlake.com with the details (date, how many people expected, etc.) instead of discussing it in person. I emailed that address and never heard back. After a few days I called to talk to the manager. I was told on the phone to be patient, that reservations for events are based on the order they're received, and that they'd get back to my email. In the weeks before my event I never got a response so I decided to make arrangements at Givers and Takers, a new bar in Gowanus, who were super easy to communicate with. I ended up having a great event at Givers and Takers and I won't be stopping by for a drink at Lavender Lake anytime soon.

Lavender Lake,5442,383 Carroll St,Brooklyn,11231.0,41602,"Perhaps the most mismanaged restaurant I've been to this year. I'll save you the details on how disorganized they were and just mention a few fun points:1) We were a huge party of something like 25 people. Our host had made a reservation, but they had done absolutely nothing to prepare for us. We had to go back and arrange our own seating. We managed to put together an area for our party with zero help from the staff. 2) The food came out in MASSIVE platters, but only one or two platters of each dish. For example, one table got a giant platter of fries (imagine fries for 25 people on one plate... like a garbage can lid full of fries) and the other table got none. When we asked if they could bring the food out in smaller dishes so that everyone could have some, the waiter looked at us as if we had asked for a round of baby clubbed seals. 3) There were only two or three waiters running the whole place (the place is huge). We had to go to the bar and get bottles of wine to bring back to the party, because it would take the waiter up to 30 minutes to return with another round. It was a real $h!t show. And when we were basically done and ready to leave the waiter shoes up with like 10 beers and just puts them on a bench near by. Our host took them and gave them away to nearby diners. 4) Actually some of the dishes were quite good. The ""Brooklyn artisanal"" vibe is corny, but the artisinal pickles are dope. Overall, some of the dishes were nice but the overall experience was a bloody nightmare.The salads were great. But there was an hour gap between the salads and the burgers. And when the sliders came out they were hard, dry and overcooked. It was such a big let down after all that waiting. Maybe its better for smaller parties. But if I'm reviewing our dining experience I give it a big huge FAIL. What a sucky dining experience. So many of us left irritated and unhappy.

Layali Dubai offers great service by its workers, respectful and very delicious food. If you are in the mood for Couscous then Friday is the best time come for yummy fresh Couscous.Shisha is always great and fresh and their smoothies are just awesome.The decorations are beautiful especially the couches, floor, and lighting. There is a elevator and stairs because Layali Dubai is on the second floor. This place is great to host events and parties, holds a good amount of people as well.Fridays and Saturdays is the greatest time of the week because it has a live band and belly dancer. If you are a Arabic music fan.. then PLEASE come here because their music is just AMAZING. The band plays a mix of music styles from all of the Arab World, ( Egyptian, Moroccan,Algerian,Tunisian,Khaleeji,Iraqi and of course DABKAH!!!) The lounge has a enough space in the center to dance.

Layali Dubai,5444,24-17 Steinway St,Astoria,11105.0,60127,"Hey, my name is Figgy, and I had the pleasure of dining at Layali Dubai this past Saturday night with my friend to watch my friend's wife perform at the venue. We were both blown away! The food, the pageantry, the service were all top notch. Middle Eastern cuisine and culture at it's finest at Layali Dubai.As a Latino, with an Indian friend that accompanied me this evening, we obviously do not speak the Arabic language but it did not prevent us from enjoying the entertainment; I am very in-tune with the culture as I have many Middle Eastern friends but the entire experience was very new to us and we loved every minute of it. The awesome hostess Adeer took care of us providing us a tremendous table, the best waitress ever, and even calling me to confirm the reservation that afternoon. We arrived right before the belly dancing portion of the entertainment (photo provided) which was amazing. The performer is very beautiful, talented, charismatic, and she even performed a routine with flames which was very cool. Now I am biased about one of the singers the very talented Rana because her husband is one of my closest friends but she rocked the house as did the other singer that performed that night. The food was amazing! AMAZING! Arguable the best Middle Eastern food I have ever had in New York City. We had the Chicken Kabobs with a seasoned rice and a thin crust pita bread that was seasoned with a pesto oil. Everything was delicious! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the rice was amazing, the pita was the hit of the night. The soups (spinach and chicken/pasta) they provided before the meal which were included with the meal were delicious. What an amazing night and friendly atmosphere from everyone from the staff to the patrons. The owner of the establishment does an excellent job providing a quality experience. As perfect as the experience as it was for me, I have seen a couple of people online complain about problems with reservations, wait times, no drinks, the entertainment charge, etc. In my experience, and I look for things to put in my reviews, I did not notice any issues, and the place was packed on Saturday night so ignore those criticisms. Regarding the drinks, the place is dry, no drinks. As I understand it, there is a mosque across the street, and the establishment is respectful of the Islamic faith which I give them credit for doing because it adds nicely to the atmosphere that there is no booze. My one criticism, small one, I will admit that I am not a fan of the $10 or $20 entertainment charge because I am used to places eating the cost of entertainment but many places like Club Aladdin in New Jersey for example charge the same fee so I guess that is a staple of the business model for Middle Eastern lounges. I will say that once you get over the charge that everything else is quality for the money charged especially the food which is worth every single penny. I highly recommend this spot and I encourage everyone to check it out.  As-salamu alaykum :)",5.0 star rating,"Bayonne, NJ",4,1,0.600000023842,18.8999996185,"cuisine,friend,friend,name,pleasure,dining,venue,Middle Eastern,top notch,performer,wife,Figgy,Layali Dubai.As,friend,rice,culture,pita,pageantry,service,finest,Adeer,experience,everything,photo,flames,staple,pita bread,experience,establishment,Latino,Indian,Islamic,friends,entertainment,food,culture,care,food,Everything,one,language,waitress,chicken,entertainment,friends,food,places,one,everyone,husband,faith,reservation,meal,singer,singers,table,chicken,meal,atmosphere,establishment,belly dancing portion,routine,house,Chicken Kabobs,pesto oil,entertainment,experience,places,spinach,pasta,soups,patrons,staff,job,owner,Arabic,entertainment charge,mosque,booze,atmosphere,criticism,street,fan,cost,Rana,New York City,charge,place,credit,drinks,lounges,business model,example,penny,money,alaykum,everyone,drinks,fee,spot,drinks,experience,entertainment charge,reservations,criticisms,place,people,couple,problems,things,reviews,issues,New Jersey,Club Aladdin","7,1,1,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,6,6,7,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,2,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,3,4,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,5,7,2,3","0.0712059289217,0.0458291433752,0.0458291433752,0.0391442999244,0.0320117659867,0.0320117659867,0.0320117659867,0.0307278092951,0.0300180725753,0.0274067316204,0.026837863028,0.0235549453646,0.0217121839523,0.0217083599418,0.0177482906729,0.0172907821834,0.0172718781978,0.0151894995943,0.0151894995943,0.0151343708858,0.0145467827097,0.0144109018147,0.0125580020249,0.0118121616542,0.0117891496047,0.0105772903189,0.00980812590569,0.00933770556003,0.00932183675468,0.00896995607764,0.00896995607764,0.00832930766046,0.00830480549484,0.00820031575859,0.00753478240222,0.00661009037867,0.00638255523518,0.00624149059877,0.00621248222888,0.00603283336386,0.00578370317817,0.00576737429947,0.00576680479571,0.00557917589322,0.00555887632072,0.0052137253806,0.00516813155264,0.00486374413595,0.00474854605272,0.00474070431665,0.00473111588508,0.00468171993271,0.00443378090858,0.00442386139184,0.00442386139184,0.00441982084885,0.00441552186385,0.00401613395661,0.00401285011321,0.00400976743549,0.00388465914875,0.00387707562186,0.00387051864527,0.00385067611933,0.00385067611933,0.0037522688508,0.00363602186553,0.00353342387825,0.0035137438681,0.0035137438681,0.0035137438681,0.00351087027229,0.00351087027229,0.00350817292929,0.00350817292929,0.00342452409677,0.00328285829164,0.00324251502752,0.00320166489109,0.00298760295846,0.00283818296157,0.00261378730647,0.00261224573478,0.00254682986997,0.00229126401246,0.00228202948347,0.00227148341946,0.00190054648556,0.00185594661161,0.00181108235847,0.0018083936302,0.0018083936302,0.0018083936302,0.00180737441406,0.00180737441406,0.00180546403863,0.00180236122105,0.00178825727198,0.00178560253698,0.00159122084733,0.00155746540986,0.00155248853844,0.00144333369099,0.00131269101985,0.00131179112941,0.00118944281712,0.0011483815033,0.0011483815033,0.0011483815033,0.00114759418648,0.00114759418648,0.00114759418648,0.00107029580977,0.00107029580977"

(I have this pic in one of my profile photos!)-We were told that the belly dancers perform after 12 am but unfortunately we had to leave early because my friend had work the next day.  -But before we left, our hostess bought out a cute but huge platter of fresh fruit with a candle in the middle and started singing Happy Birthday and I joined in singing, totally embarrassing my bf! Lol That was a really sweet gesture on behalf of Layali Dubai. -Tonight's visit was great and I was so happy to return and enjoy my night. We opted just for dinner and no didn't go for the Hookah. We started with Mozzarella sticks with French fries and shared a plate of the All in one Kebab Plate, which had a good amount of food for two people.  Everything we ate was hot, tasty, fresh and it tasted like they prepared and cooked it right off the grill. -Our server was amazing and their staff is friendly as always. I love the whole vibe of the place, it was a relaxing and beautiful at the same time with the dim lights. The Arabic theme of plush pillows and middle eastern interior design is exquisite. The romantic ambiance of the restaurant is what drew me in. They have a lot of space to move around and dance. I love their lounge like sofas in one part of the restaurant, the music makes you want to get up and dance like Shakira! -Layali Dubai is a wonderful place to celebrate any occasion with your friends, family and significant other. For authentic Middle Eastern dishes and a welcoming party atmosphere, I'll certainly be back for sure.",4.0 star rating,"Floral Park, NY",2,0,0.5,13.6999998093,"belly dancers,time,friend,birthday,part,something,BFF,cuisine,Everything,Nothing,Kebab Plate,gesture,Lol,Layali Dubai,one,server,fruits,top,dining experience,cherry,pic,profile photos,friend,pineapple drink,plate,fries,visit,fruit,platter,work,middle,bf,candle,hostess,behalf,dinner,vibe,dance,amount,food,people,Mozzarella sticks,part,ambiance,restaurant,restaurant,Happy Birthday,occasion,lounge,interior design,lot,space,sofas,music,place,dance,friends,Hookah,French,family,significant other,dishes,party atmosphere,server,staff,theme,Middle Eastern,place,grill,lights,pillows,Shakira,Arabic","1,7,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,1,6,7,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,2,5,4,2,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,1,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,6,7,6,1,7","0.124845400453,0.0818748921156,0.08114592731,0.0754885971546,0.0357671529055,0.028835715726,0.0286887343973,0.0285848993808,0.0282773301005,0.0279745459557,0.0273390896618,0.0236916132271,0.0201857443899,0.0140909114853,0.0136748859659,0.0124690271914,0.0124690271914,0.0109118046239,0.0109118046239,0.0109118046239,0.0108866542578,0.0108866542578,0.0105908494443,0.00986092723906,0.00964283104986,0.00902860797942,0.00873367022723,0.00838612765074,0.00833105575293,0.00735227065161,0.00733792828396,0.00733792828396,0.00733792828396,0.00733792828396,0.00732552679256,0.00730484956875,0.00689735868946,0.00670982105657,0.0066768983379,0.0066768983379,0.0066768983379,0.0066768983379,0.00622978340834,0.00608128495514,0.00567491771653,0.00566645385697,0.00546017056331,0.00541401607916,0.0051499302499,0.00496926577762,0.00496138911694,0.00496138911694,0.00495779607445,0.00495779607445,0.0048636929132,0.00464295689017,0.00463977595791,0.00432556029409,0.00395348202437,0.00343031832017,0.00343031832017,0.00342808803543,0.00342808803543,0.00298077892512,0.00267477659509,0.00266992719844,0.0025502499193,0.00249356334098,0.00218577939086,0.00218151044101,0.00217960239388,0.00203189952299,0.00129001657479"

Which this place has. But that's not all.....You have two options when you walk in on a Saturday night. You can do the $20/person option which is for the live music and then you can buy everything a la carte. Or, go for the $50/person, you get live music, an assortment of at least 8 (yes, 8!!!) appetizers, an entree, soda, and water which we did. We had tons of apps, and ordered different entrees to share and try and had tons of food left over which we brought home. The hookah was good, the food was amazing, the band and singers were great too. But the belly dancer stole the show. She danced to probably 5-6 songs and was amazing.

I was not sure what to expect since my usual hookah location is in bay ridge and me and a couple of friends decided to check out Steinway. So we walked down from 30th all the way to Dubai. We saw some nice places eventually some older gentleman told me and my friends about the place on the second floor, he told us it's for people in our age group. At first I thought it would some teen hang out.... Not at all! This place was absolutely beautiful! It was comfortable they had a guy sing for a few hours and eventually we decided to leave but we didn't... Just when we were about to leave a beautiful belly dancer and comes out and dances. You can't get this anywhere else in ny. I believe this was hands down the greatest hookah place I've been too and I've been to a lot of them. The check wasn't as bad as me and my friends expected, it was in the high 60s but that was because of the live music fee. The hookahs are excellent there, they are decent prices 10+. Also had a deal buy 2 get 1 free... 3 hookahs.wow! Service excellent and on point, had to wait a little while for some coal but we didn't care because we were so amused by the belly dancers talent.when we left, we saw the same old man and had to thank him for helping us find this place.

First, the atmosphere is very nice and chill. Clean, spacious. I loved the decor. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. And the coal guys came around frequently. My boyfriend and I ordered mango juices ($5 each) and the fresh pineapple hookah ($17 though the menu says $14).The hookah was smooth and pleasant. It was my bf's first time smoking hookah and he liked it. Also tried the mint from a friends pipe. It was strong, flavorful and minty! haha I liked it though she thought it was too strong.I never order food when I hookah but someone recommended the  macaroni bechemel ($10) which was  cold and tasteless. Is it possible to have good food AND hookah? Overall 3 stars because the macaroni left me really really disappointed, and hungry. Also the same friend that ordered the mint hookah ordered orzo soup, and wasn't too impressed. AND the bill was almost 50 bucks (big party so gratuity was included).

We were group of 4 and as we came around 5pm we just walked in with no reservation. Its a beautiful spacious place. There were hardly 3-4 people but host & servers were ready to work. They let us sit anywhere we want and we picked best lounge couch in the house. I was mesmerized by the decor & how big beautiful lounge this is. Our host was the best she really took care of us. We ordered hookah, cappuccino, lemon mint smoothie, Lamb entree, liver appetizer & 1 more dish. Every thing was on point , very tasty , good quantity, decent price 20% gratuity was included. We didn't even miss Alcohol at all as they don't serve one anyhow. Our husbands stepped out to buy some desserts from outside and they let us get it in even serve us utensils to eat our desserts with no charge, Hookah was on point and they kept checking on the coal.

I love the layout of the cafe and the design but service was ..... Lol pretty shitty! We waited a good 8 minutes for someone to finally come to the table, we ordered hookah and... Worst hookah ever. It was either you were burning the crap out of it or there was barely any smoke. Then the taste of the double apple wasn't good. It was like they mixed it with something else. Maybe that's why the waiter said ""house mix double apple!"" When asked what brand they used for their double apple. Fiancé ordered a guava smoothie and simply asked for barely no ice but with milk and sugar mixed in, it wasn't sweet at all. So I drank it after asking if I could get some honey added to it. You would think that they would take it back, put in back in the blender for u and then add the honey. No, he gave me a side of honey. Lol.

Layali Dubai,5444,24-17 Steinway St,Astoria,11105.0,190346,"So last night I was on a mission to find a great hookah spot that also had good food on Steinway. We stopped into a spot called Villa, it was very small and tight. Barely any space on the tables. It was 3 of us but they sat us at a table for 2... no idea way. I couldn't imagine how people had room to eat in that place, the tables were small and did not feel like a place equipped to dine in.  We got up and left and went to Layali. The entrance to this place  we so beautiful, I already knew it was going to be a high quality establishment. It is located in the second floor and I must say this place is huge!! The amount of space and openness is awesome. You will not feel tight or clustered in like the other spots on Steinway. This place was full of tables, booths and vip areas for huge parties. You actually had space to breathe. Also, they had an AC ventilation system they kept the place cool. For apps we had the hummus which came with 3 naan roti, it was a very delicious appetizer. Hummus and roti were fresh and hot. For entree I had the chicken tikka over the basmati rice. The chicken was juicy white meat breast, grilled to perfection. The rice along with the signature white sauce was so tasty. Very generous portion and you will be full after downing the entire plate lol. We also tried the Moroccan tea, which had a nice mint leaf taste to it, we had about two rounds. For hookah I had to get a mint hookah, you could never go wrong with mint. We also opted for the ice hose. I gotta say this was such a cool, and smooth hookah. Some places the hookah is harsh and makes you choke. But this was smooth and easy to inhale.

The place is gorgeous with polished venetian plaster walls and ceiling and turkish stained glass chandeliers and lots of windows on the second floor with beautiful views of Astoria and Steinway Street. The floors are beautiful Italian tiles and the furniture very middle eastern and very luxe. Its a lovely place that doesnt serve alcohol and keeps the riff raff out. A perfect place for a date or a family dinner. I for one, Highly recommend it. Plus you cant beat the live arabic music on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and marvelous varied Arabic singers from lands far off as Morrocco to Palestine to Iraq to Egypt.

When we were ready around 1:20AM she told us the kitchen was closed. I understand it is late and people want to go home and the kitchen takes time to clean. I get it. I believe the waitress should have given us a head up as to the closing kitchen since she saw us hold on to the menu and we told her we still wanted to order. The one appetizer we did get was The sampler, which was horrible... it was all frozen food and I'm really disappointed. We did not get checked on I didn't even get napkins for all those finger foods.

We ordered some hookahs, and then the band came on. They tried to make us feel welcome by inviting us to dance which was funny, we all said no. My only complaint was that because we were outsiders, when we were taking pictures of the belly dancers a bouncer approached us and said no pictures. However, the rest of the patrons were not approached. Since we're not middle eastern i feel like that is why that happened but it's not a big deal to me, we got the pictures we wanted anyway.

It's very well decorated and has plenty of room for small and large parties. If you plan on coming here Thurs-Sat, make sure to make a reservation or else you'll be waiting on line and get not the best of seating if you make it in. Also, I would try to sit as far as I could away from the band cause it's extremely loud (live band on the weekends). The food was very good and came out fast.The service was excellent. Our waitress was great.Large hookah selection and the prices were very comparable to other locations in the area. They have those ""specialty"" hookahs that you see pictures off, and in my opinion, stay away, not worth the $30 they charge for each. They look good but that's about it. Stick with the ""normal"" everyday hookah and enjoy. They also did a very good job on coming around often and switching out the coal on the hookah.They have belly dancers on the weekends as well, but they don't usually start until after 11pm. CONS:The ""specialty"" hookahs they have...believe it's called Fares and Dubai...not worth spending $30 on each. They look great but that's about it. Order a normal hookah you're used to. The place is not cheap. For two people, our bill was about $104 (including tip)! We ordered ONE entree, a specialty hookah, bottled water, and green tea. They automatically add a 15% gratuity to each check, no matter how big or small your party is (we had two people). The biggest thing they don't tell you is that on the weekends when they have a live band, they automatically charge a $10 per person ""music charge""!

We were looking for a place to sit, relax, have some tea or coffee, but most importantly, we wanted hookah.My first impression of the place upon entering - it's very dimly lit, and the decor looks like the cover of the late Edward Said's book ""Orientalism"". Because it was afternoon, there weren't that many people, but as the afternoon progressed along, people did trickle in. It seems like the place really gets going on Saturday evenings, once the entertainment portion of the night begins.The hookah is divine! I would recommend getting the fruit head (usually a grapefruit) for a several reasons - 1. more tobacco compared to the regular clay/ceramic bowl 2. it lengthens your smoke session 3. keeps the tobacco cool 4. amplifies the flavorWe got a couple of hookahs because my one friend doesn't share his at all. The service was great and the staff made us feel completely at home. We ordered a teakettle, had some sweets and a plate of fruit.I haven't tried the food yet, but I'm hoping to sample it on my next visit to Astoria.Keep in mind though... on Saturday night there is a $20 cover per person for the entertainment, which features a live band and a belly dancer.",5.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",2,1,0.20000000298,4.30000019073,"place,friends,couple,lunch,elsewhere,Queens,entertainment,Orientalism,place,impression,coffee,tea,decor,hookah,entertainment portion,cover,people,hookah.My,tobacco,friend,fruit head,grapefruit,reasons,bowl,clay,smoke session,fruit.,home,plate,sweets,teakettle,cover,food,Edward Said,people,visit,mind,person,belly dancer,hookahs,service,band,staff,Astoria.,couple,flavorWe","7,1,1,4,2,2,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,1,6,7,7,6,7,4,7,2,6,6,6,7,7,1,1,4,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,2,7,7","0.162157326937,0.100644558668,0.100644558668,0.08834502846,0.08834502846,0.0527932718396,0.0428290180862,0.0247673131526,0.0204808469862,0.016312757507,0.016312757507,0.016312757507,0.0155088454485,0.0137244258076,0.0133780660108,0.0125958751887,0.0125314565375,0.0121467839926,0.0113695636392,0.0108633581549,0.0099728340283,0.0099728340283,0.0099728340283,0.00994985084981,0.00994985084981,0.0099304607138,0.00843340344727,0.0073885046877,0.00737959239632,0.00737959239632,0.00737959239632,0.00724459532648,0.00710448436439,0.00653096102178,0.00543412519619,0.00511079095304,0.00511079095304,0.00511079095304,0.00511079095304,0.00407983129844,0.00387188838795,0.00386721338145,0.0034109049011,0.00302594760433,0.00273730605841,0.00247662304901"

Lazy Ibis,5445,663 Franklin Ave,Brooklyn,11238.0,195214,"This long (unnecessarily long, tbh) story is about worst dining experience of my life, which culminated in a grown man mocking me in a way reminiscent of schoolyard bullying...but let's get caveats out of the way first:-One, I am writing this immediately after the fact, so my objectivity is suspect. -Two, I had a rough morning (flat tire and a mouse across my feet), so my nerves were already exposed. -Three, it's 95 degrees out and I suspect that everyone else's nerves are somewhat exposed as well. Now, to the tirade. This story starts off innocently enough as a ""run-of-the-mill bad"" dining experience. I walked in and the place was less than half full, but almost every table had dirty dishes and food remnants spread about. It seemed they had a rush before I arrived. The server took a while to get to me and then asked for my order: brisket and biscuit. He thought they might be out of brisket and said he would check. He also said he would bring over a pitcher of water. Ten minutes later he walks by me after bussing tables and says he hasn't forgotten me and will be right back. Another ten minutes later he returns and asks me to remind him of my drink order (I hadn't ordered a drink). I inquire again about the brisket and he leaves again to check. They had brisket! Brisket ordered. No water pitcher thus far. The food arrived quickly and was a mixed bag. The biscuit was good, but on the dry side. The side salad was sparse and dry. The brisket was lacking any sauce or flavor, but was sizable and at least it wasn't dry. Also, when the food was delivered I was able to ask again for - and receive - the water pitcher. Big win!Not once did someone return to check in about the meal or anything else. At the time, there were 4 customers in the entire place. After eating, I placed my dirty dish on the other end of the small table and it was never picked up. A half hour later, nobody has moved the dish and nobody has come by to ask if I need a check. At this point, Lazy Ibis is down to 3 customers, not a one of them near me, and I have a video call coming up in 15 min. Deciding against trying to close out and embark on a hurried walk home in the heat, I determine I'll stay and take the call. This is where things go from ""meh"" bad to surprisingly bad. Five minutes into the call an employee put a heavy hand on my shoulder and barked at me that laptops aren't allowed in this section. When I try to let him know I'm speaking with someone and will move in a moment, his tone matures to full contempt. I'd been there for an hour, there were two other people in the entire place, and out of nowhere needed me to move immediately. I would have been perfectly happy to set up shop somewhere else in the room. Why hadn't they told me about this rule, that isn't posted anywhere (or anywhere noticeable anyway), in the previous hour? The call ended and I was resolved to leave as soon as possible. I got to the counter to close out with my original server. I let him know that it was a terrible dining experience and he asked me to explain why, which struck me as an opening to have a conversation. I'm ready to forget this one bad dining experience and if he wants to hear about it for the sake of improvement, then great. This is where, in a short amount of time, things go from bad...to worse...to insulting. He heard my feedback about slow service and responded that they were understaffed and slammed before I arrived. I said I thought that might be the case and understood. Then I attempted to describe the incident with my seating choice and laptop limitations. Rather than let me finish a single sentence, the heavy-handed-one came over and told me it's not his fault that I sat in the wrong section. At this point, the third employee recognized that things were getting out of hand and told us all we should drop the conversation and let things lie. I agreed, signed my check, and began walking out. As I walked past the third employee he picked up the thread of the argument again and I told him I didn't ask for this conversation to happen. To be fair though, I did bait the start. His next words were unexpected. He told me to leave. I was shocked and responded with a genuine look of shock on my face. He paused, looked me dead in the eyes, and mocked me with surprising venom.

Lazy Ibis,5445,663 Franklin Ave,Brooklyn,11238.0,195422,"I'll say it's the BEST coffee in Brooklyn! Great atmosphere, delicious food, and really nice people working there. It's a relatively new gem for Crown Heights and they're still getting their menu set, as well as trying to get used to becoming extremely popular extremely fast. The service is usually slow which gets slower as the crowd size increases, but I like that about them. I want the experience to walk into a nice atmosphere and be able to sit for a while. Because it's either take away or table service, tables aren't always being taken for hours by computer users. However, it is a computer friendly vibe.The decor is unusual and makes use of all the elements. I think someone was consulting a Feng Shui guide when they put it together. I love it! It's cozy and interesting. The food is sooooooo yummmmmmy! Their best dish is the breakfast sliders using gorgeous ingredients and handmade biscuits for the bread. The biscuits come in unique and traditional flavors. My picky friends from North Carolina even loved them. They also have great vegan options like vegan chili, vegan scrambles, and granola (if you request it without yoghurt). However, they tend to run out of the vegan options (hence the 4 stars). Now, what we've all been waiting for: the COFFEE. It is unparalleled. They roast their own beans right there on the premises.

When the food arrived, we again asked if the grilled cheese had meat in it because we had no faith in the staff at this point. She said nope they got it out.

Mmmmm.The biscuit sliders are also great, and really too big to be called sliders.  The biscuits are fluffy and savory and not at all dry.  I've had the Green Eggs and Ham and the Roasted Tomato Goat Cheese and Egg biscuit sliders.  My preference is for the roasted tomato and goat cheese.  They recently changed the menu-- instead of getting two sliders per order, you now get one and a side of either sweet potatoes or cauliflower.  I would normally tend to order sweet potatoes, but the cauliflower is better.  I liked it better when you got two sliders and no side.You order at the counter and then they run your food out to wherever your sitting as it's ready.  The decor is kind of schizophrenic (bird murals, fish tank, irregularly shaped wooden tables, tin roof), but I don't mind it.  The staff is very friendly and chill.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.5,9.39999961853,"food spot,place,street,kind,stretch,coffee,granola,Franklin Ave,yogurt,potatoes,sliders,sliders,growing pains,things,ladyfriend,decor,biscuit sliders,granola,yogurt,A bowl,granola bowl,biscuits,house,in-house,nuts,crunch,berry compote,everything,Mmmmm.,cauliflower,going.My,side.,chance,sitting,counter,Roasted Tomato Goat Cheese,staff,Green Eggs and Ham,bird murals,fish tank,tables,tin roof,biscuit sliders,sliders,food,preference,tomato,goat cheese,side,cauliflower,Egg,order,menu","7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,4,7,6,1,5,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.136847987771,0.136847987771,0.134450152516,0.0723083689809,0.0667437911034,0.0585472732782,0.0352662689984,0.0349179394543,0.0348868817091,0.0260440036654,0.0144577538595,0.0137778548524,0.0107676852494,0.0107676852494,0.0104987900704,0.0104801421985,0.00928886700422,0.00913767050952,0.00913767050952,0.00831254944205,0.00831254944205,0.00830153003335,0.00823995564133,0.00819778349251,0.00721068913117,0.00721068913117,0.00719034904614,0.0071737729013,0.00715978723019,0.00680651096627,0.00638080947101,0.00555252050981,0.00514122704044,0.00485841045156,0.00485841045156,0.00442132726312,0.00411312561482,0.00386844598688,0.0033611448016,0.0033611448016,0.0033611448016,0.0033611448016,0.00323629472405,0.00322807324119,0.00280092447065,0.00261958152987,0.0024444416631,0.0024444416631,0.00244148960337,0.00244148960337,0.00214145286009,0.00213601090945,0.00213601090945"

I've been going to this cafe regularly for over a month and I've visited others as well. Lazy Ibis is better in almost every way. There are always people, but it's never too crowded to find a place to sit. I've never had trouble getting a seat next to an outlet. The music is also much better than other places I've been to so far. I could sit here all afternoon and be perfectly content. Most importantly, the coffee is exceptional. It's fresh and served in the actual portions and glasses you'd receive if you were in Italy- not in a to-go cup. The food is always excellent, and its unique. The menu is small but has variety. The biscuit and gravy is hard to beat, the grilled cheese waffle is pleasantly surprising (again different), and they use duck as the meat in a lot of their food (except vegetarian) which adds to their distinct menu. I have yet to order something I haven't liked. If you are open to a slightly new take on breakfast and lunch, you will love this place. If you're skeptical, get one of their pastries, you won't be disappointed. I've seen the hits in previous reviews about service. I don't think they fall short here either, maybe they've improved since before I started coming. Everyone has been attentive, respectful and kind.

Lazy Ibis,5445,663 Franklin Ave,Brooklyn,11238.0,89973,"I always want to like Lazy Ibis more than I do. It has a nice ambiance and is very well-located on the northern side of Crown Heights on Franklin. The menu is limited, kind of gourmet, but unique, and it's usually not too crowded. The menu also doesn't allow changes - so if you want to get a dish with meat in it without meat, it will still cost you $10-$12. There's also an $8 minimum for laptop use. Some other cafes will have certain tables where you can't use laptops, but having a price minimum is another way to go about it- I guess it makes sense. Service was friendly and attentive.My main qualm is the prices. They are out of proportion with other similar establishments in the area. For example, whereas at nearby Nagle's bagels, Forte, Bagel Pub, Colina Cuervo, or Outpost (in Clinton hill), a bagel or vegetarian sandwich will cost you between $5-$7, here, yelp.com/biz/lazy-ibis-b… simple egg, cheese and tomato sandwich is $9! This seems  ridiculous to me, and I bet they'd have much better business if they slightly reduced their prices. Granted, I did really like my roast beef sandwich, which was $10.

Amidst all the competition, some of these cafes are bound to close eventually, and I really hope this one never does. This places deserves to be a Crown Heights institution.I grew up in a coffeehouse culture, and was shocked at this grand global city's lack of any cafes, when I first arrived, and have been totally unimpressed by the totally uncomfortable, stressed out, cramped, and charmless cafes that have popped up in the last 4 years of NYC's cafe boom. THIS is the first place (aside from a few classics like Reggios and the Hungarian Pastry Shop, and Vox Populi (RIP:() that has passed the test. Reminds me slightly of the atmosphere of Bread Stuy (RIP), but with much, much stronger coffee and pastries.Why? NO pretension here, and A LOT of quality. 1. This is a place you want to stay a while, and return to.Well laid-out: creates excellent atmosphere.The types of seating, range. Importantly: it's not all cold hard work-tables with detached people furrowing their brows. You can chat with your friend here, too! Without feeling like you're telling the world your business or getting dirty looks for disturbing people's work.At the same time, it's easy to get a lot of work done here, too. Tables are good and solid for working on, with elbow room and no sense of crowdedness like everywhere else in NYC. I havent been able to really get into the right mental zone in lots of cafes because I am so conscious of everyone's every move and cant really concentrate. I've been coming here every day for the last bit and am finally getting past some serious writers' block. 2. Reliable fare.The richness of the coffee. A lot of places have coffee that is either too damned weak, or too expensive, or both. The coffee is just right here, and affordable. I don't feel like Im ever going to get a cappuccino here for 3.75 that I actually want to pour down the drain because it's burned or weak or the foam is like prickly soap bubbles or there is no foam at all (as has happened at some point at most other cafes on Franklin). No money down the drain here, everything is worth the price.The in-house baked goods are all really well done.

But they seriously need to figure out their staffing issues.I live around the corner and have been here many times, both for take-out and dine-in, and every time I go I find that there's only a single employee functioning as hostess, server and cashier. This creates an overall poor experience for everyone involved (including the employee!) because service is inattentive, orders are forgotten, and people who have never been there are trying to figure out whether this is actually a sit down place or not because no one is coming to seat them. The one employee always seems extremely rushed and distracted, and I almost feel bad even trying to get their attention.I went in around 11:45am today (Monday) with the goal of getting a muffin for take out. Literally just a muffin. There was no line at the register, and yet I ended up standing there for 10 minutes because the cashier was in the process of trying to serve and input the orders of everyone who was seated in the cafe.Please, Lazy Ibis... I want to love you, but I often end up walking further down Franklin just because I don't want to add to the burden of your single employee (or wait 10 minutes for a muffin).

The phone started ringing and the barista wouldn't pick it up, saying he had no boss or something. Really dude? If paying back a customer for one pound of coffee is really that big a deal, even calling the police over, then I'm sure not frequenting this place ever again.

Lazy Ibis,5445,663 Franklin Ave,Brooklyn,11238.0,163464,"The best thing about this place is that it is a sign-- along with a couple of other recent openings- that Franklin Avenue is starting to get its act together. Its no secret that the gentrification along this strip in Crown Heights has moved at the speed of light (far faster than on 5th Avenue in the mid 2000s or on Vanderbilt a few years later). In the process, a lot of places have opened that just aren't that good. This place is very good.rm (from 11/26/2013) has a nice summary of what makes this place so nice. I just want to add a couple more thoughts.You can tell a cafe that's had some thought put into it, and a lot of times these cafes speak to the nature of the place they are in -- either what that place is or what people would like that place to be. The last really striking coffee shop I can remember in Brooklyn was Gorilla Coffee on 5th Avenue. It was a big deal when it opened, incredibly well branded, and served REALLY strong coffee. The owners drove around red mopeds that matched the color of the Gorilla. The staff there was surly beyond belief and looked like they were all out of a 2006 remake of Rent. In short- it was great for what it was, a true place of the time, with a very hard core attitude of the hip Brooklyn. A guy in there used to sit at a table and rip audio tracks on a large mixing board.So far, the place closest to that on Franklin, when it comes to trying to create the vision of a place you would like to be, is a place called Little Zeldas. They opened a fancy cheese shop next door. They have Proust readings (or maybe David Foster Wallace readings) some night during the week. It is super cramped. And so forth.  In other words- their vision of the place they want Franklin to be and mine aren't exactly the same. They are Very Serious. Lazy Ibis is not like that. It has got a great ambiance, a very inviting, really quirky decor, SPACE, and a relaxed, friendly vibe. It seems to be bridging the gap between the ""old"" Franklin and the ""new"" one very well.To conclude (and to some people this would be a diss, but its not) it actually reminds me of some of the places in Montrose is used to go when I lived in Houston in the late 90s.Anyway, good luck to Lazy Ibis.
