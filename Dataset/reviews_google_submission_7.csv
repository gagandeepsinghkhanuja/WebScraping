Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,63703,"My husband brought me here for my birthday in June. Our reservation was late and, as many others have said, we did have to wait to be seated well beyond our reservation time. We shared a few small plates and had a few drinks in the back bar before being seated; the homemade mozzarella and the prosciutto with balsamic mustard was soooooo good. We probably could have stopped there, but as a birthday dinner we came to indulge. We were drunk by the time we sat down for dinner and I can't really remember what we ordered for our starter or mains, but we definitely had some kind of salad that was awesome, a pasta dish that was great (but a little too salty) and I had a pork chop dish that I remember thinking was dynamite. The whole vibe of the restaurant makes you feel like you just landed at a hip new restaurant in the NYC area...which is definitely what they're going for. Great date spot or place to take foodie friends who may not have heard of it yet.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",1,0,0.600000023842,4.5,"birthday,husband,reservation,others,kind,restaurant,plates,drinks,pork chop dish,foodie friends,mozzarella,birthday dinner,dinner,pasta dish,bar,prosciutto,mustard,salad,mains,starter,restaurant,vibe,hip,area,date spot,place,NYC","4,1,7,1,7,2,6,6,7,1,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,2,1,7,2,7,7,2","0.187236130238,0.110644467175,0.107721485198,0.0735582858324,0.0564430467784,0.0493761301041,0.0348524674773,0.0303361564875,0.0292098652571,0.0257300939411,0.0244751553982,0.0233437605202,0.0232780259103,0.0212545786053,0.0205058529973,0.0205058529973,0.0205058529973,0.0186478719115,0.0186478719115,0.0186478719115,0.0158921331167,0.0139071652666,0.0139071652666,0.0139071652666,0.00961400382221,0.00961400382221,0.00823754817247"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199356,"While the food is delicious and the wine selection is great, I needed to review on Yelp (I never do) and only give it 3 stars because of the service. I've now been twice, and both times have had questionable experiences with service. My first time, we had a waiter who was less than friendly, and ordered an escarole dish that was so salty it was basically inedible. We barely touched it, and when we told the waiter, he didn't even apologize - he basically did nothing. Didn't offer to bring us something else, take it off the bill, comp something, nothing - for such a ""hot spot"" and not a cheap spot either, this rubbed me the wrong way. But I came back, because I liked the food and ambience and thought it was just our waiter. This time, while once again I had a reservation at 8:30 on a Wednesday, they made us wait 30 minutes for our table because ""we were a little ahead of them"" - whatever that means. And if I hadn't gone and asked another hostess (who looked more in charge) I don't think I would have been seated - I'm pretty positive they just forgot us. Fine. Barely received an apology, didn't offer to comp us anything again - which, by the way, the night before I went to Barbuto and was given free prosecco and dessert for having to wait for my reserved table when it was actually my fault for changing the reservation number. Here, when I showed up on time, I barely got an ""I'm sorry"" from anyone for something that was their fault. Then while my waitress was so sweet this time, our dinner took well over 2 hours - we waited almost 45 minutes for our entrees. Once again, I think they forgot about us, as I saw a runner legit RUN across the restaurant and come back with our food that looked a little like it sat under the lights too long though fortunately was still delicious. And once again, no apology from the waitress, didn't even comment at any point that we we waited for our table and now our food for almost 45 minutes. Not the type of service I would expect for a restaurant getting such high praise. While I love the food, ambience, and wine list, after 2 experiences with the service I just think I would rather go somewhere else that has equal or better food (I think the food is great but you can find just as great Italian food elsewhere - like barbuto for that matter) and treats its customers' time with more respect and acknowledges issues in the kitchen like other restaurants do - with apologies, offers for different food, comped dessert, whatever it might be. Just an I'm sorry would have helped - but no. Better service and equally tasty food can definitely be found elsewhere.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,13.1999998093,"waiter,escarole dish,food,service,wine selection,food,table,something,service,times,stars,service,waiter,Yelp,something,experiences,food,hostess,food,nothing,spot,spot,way,dessert,something,waitress,bill,apology,table,food,food,ambience,whatever,reservation,dessert,way,dinner,charge,Fine,anything,apology,reservation number,anyone,entrees,restaurant,barbuto,food,food,food,experiences,ambience,point,prosecco,type,praise,somewhere,wine list,Barbuto,service,elsewhere,restaurants,apologies,whatever,matter,customers,respect,issues,kitchen,waitress,Italian,restaurant,table,little,RUN,runner,lights","1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,2,2,7,7,7,1,7","0.176143050194,0.116377912462,0.0729675367475,0.0491126328707,0.0419639199972,0.0404987148941,0.0387719087303,0.0387255772948,0.0309795904905,0.0263217538595,0.0244432538748,0.023498242721,0.0221323352307,0.0203982833773,0.0197820533067,0.0187211092561,0.0116578536108,0.0109947798774,0.00750305410475,0.00709863798693,0.00707860849798,0.00707860849798,0.00707860849798,0.00695793889463,0.00668479176238,0.00649013882503,0.00619391864166,0.0053426399827,0.00523255672306,0.00513242324814,0.00494099641219,0.00476873712614,0.00475943181664,0.00475943181664,0.00473796948791,0.00473796948791,0.00424206349999,0.00415719952434,0.00415099831298,0.00414545927197,0.0039248559624,0.00379351759329,0.0037889375817,0.00378476106562,0.00354328402318,0.0035189227201,0.00342133594677,0.00342133594677,0.00341623160057,0.00322012254037,0.00322012254037,0.00315533578396,0.00294398027472,0.00281957746483,0.00281957746483,0.00281727127731,0.00281727127731,0.00280520948581,0.00279755704105,0.0026343697682,0.00245119072497,0.00245119072497,0.00222939136438,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.0017778952606,0.00166763924062,0.00155685341451,0.00155539077241,0.00141594582237,0.00123872316908,0.00123872316908,0.00123872316908"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,2638,"I had a great time bringing my mom here for her birthday! The staff was very attentive and there was excellent service, as expected at this kind of restaurant. What we ordered:Cacio e Pepe fritelle- good, light and airy, but I felt the sprinkled cheese on the outside was too salty or overpowering Cauliflower sopressata- very very good. Perfect for anyone who loves a bit of vinegar with cauliflower. Recommend Mafaldini- this was good and the portion was good. It was only warm not hot when it arrived and it got cold as I was eating. But the pasta texture itself was great Sheeps milk agnolotti- love love love. The flavor and texture of this made the magaldini almost seem plain in comparison. The honey and saffron and thyme worked beautifully together. The only ""issue"" I had was that the pasta was not hot/warm. The mafaldini was maybe room temperature and the agnolotti was maybe lightly warmer. But I would except the food to be warm and not barely room temperature because eventually eating cold was a lot less appetizing, especially for the mafaldini. For desserts, our waiter was so sweet. Since I made a note it was my mom's birthday, we originally ordered the apple ginger crostata and the olive oil cake, but we had asked about the chocolate torta. So the crostata and torta came out first and we thought there was a mistake but then the brought out the olive oil cake with a candle for her birthday and the torta was on the house!

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,20785,"Sometimes you just know it's going to be good before you get there. Lilia was great from beginning to end. It was exceedingly hard to secure a reservation on Resy, but I basically just booked the reservation a month ahead of time, and took care of the logistics of finding others later. The space and decor is very clean, modern, and austere, but has a very ""polished"" look, which I was a big fan of. What we got:- Cacio e pepe frittelle: Basically super cheesy, peppery fritters. These were unreal, and we probably could have polished off a few of these- Grilled clams with calabrian chili oil and bread crumbs: Yet another dish I could have eaten many orders of.- Cauliflower and romanesco with spicy soppressata, Sicilian pesto, and marjoram: We had to get our greens from somewhere, and this was perfect- Mafaldini with pink peppercorns and parmigiano reggiano: Best pasta of the night. Pink peppercorns added that little bit of spice, and the generous amount of parmigiano reggiano really made for a rich dish. As mentioned previously, I could have eaten a bucket of this stuff.- Sheep's milk cheese filled agnolotti, saffron, dried tomato, and honey: Really delicious, and the saffron taste really came through in the sauce- Goat cheese filled tortelli, ramps, lemon: Very tasty, and I really liked the citrus- Grilled veal flank steak with hot peppers and basil: So tender, so delicious.- Chocolate soft serve with chocolate stracci and salted hazelnuts: Pretty standard, but the salted hazelnuts really added a dimension to the ice cream that I liked- Olive oil cake with blood orange and fresh cream: Super tasty, although kind of randomly plated, as the cream was just sort of piled on. They were very generous with it though, so I'm not complaining too much.Service was very attentive with drinks and food, but surprisingly not very confident with recommendations. It's not that their recommendations were bad, but they just didn't seem too sure about what they were recommending. It was a little odd, but nonetheless, everything we got was great and end to end, our meal was pretty much flawless. Prices are decent, with each of the pastas at about $19-25, and the meats all under $30, except for the dry-aged ribeye special.Will definitely be back again, provided I can secure a reservation.

It was a birthday celebration and we had made reservations for 8:30. We arrived slightly early at 8:15 and sat at the bar. Our table wasn't ready until 8:45 but they were gracious about it. From there, the service went entirely  downhill. Our waiter was distracted and disinterested. He even seemed bored when we asked his favorites from the menu. We ordered a bottle of wine (without any help from him although we asked) and it took him over 10 minutes to arrive with it.  He didn't check in throughout our meal and finding him to get our check again took 10 minutes.  I'm not uptight when it comes to service but we you are paying a premium and celebrating a special occasion you want to enjoy yourself.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,66100,"In a neighborhood where finding a decent Italian restaurant is pretty difficult, Lilia doesn't exactly help the cause. First and foremost, let me preface this by saying that I will be back to give them another chance because they have so much promise (and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the grilled clams in 4 days). Aside from the beloved clams, we started with the house made mozzarella and the bagna cauda (which came with amazing grilled bread from their wood burning stove). First off, they should never serve something so mild as the mozzarella after the overwhelmingly strong and diverse flavors of the bagna cauda. If I couldn't quite put my finger on what ""nothing"" tasted like before, this mozz was now it. Not to mention, the thick piece of sesame seed bread did nothing for the dish. They would be better off having it standout on it's own or on a thinner crostini like toast. We then had the veal papardelle (rather pleasing, if not a bit too al dente) and the biggest let down of the night, the ricotta gnocchi. Thoughts of airy clouds and fluffy feather light pillows come to mind when I see ""ricotta gnocchi"" on a menu...these were dense and overworked and boiled in saltless water (or maybe it was the wrath of the bagna cauda again...). They just were not good, simple as that. Despite some of the pitfalls, the service was a delight and made our experience that much more enjoyable.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,97731,"Lovely experience. Simple, unpretentious, classic Italian flavors that were strong but refined. We had the trumpet mushrooms, artichoke, scallops, veal, mafaldini and pappardelle. Finished it off with olive oil cake which was fantastic- moist and dense with a caramelized crust. Everything was delicious, although the artichokes weren't anything special. The highlight of the meal was, unsurprisingly, the pasta- what Missy Robbins does best. The texture was perfect. The mafaldini was hearty and lemony, peppery and buttery. The pappardelle was delicate with the most gorgeous, meaty sauce. However, the appetizers are the weakest part of the menu. I'd suggest skipping those (or going for classics like the gem lettuce and fennel) and ordering pasta, fish and meat dishes. The plates are definitely on the small side. Maybe we eat a lot, but our order was sufficient for two people, with room for maybe even another main.Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The place is huge and beautiful. Ambient lighting, high ceilings and an open kitchen where you can watch the action. There are also more private, enclosed seating areas in the back and behind the hostess stand. Great place for a date! Only one hiccup: when we came for our reservation, the restaurant still had plenty of open tables, but we still had to wait 15 min to be seated.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,30662,"Pete Wells wrote about Lilia a few months ago, which is when I first heard about the restaurant. While visiting New York, a fellow classmate of mine recommend I come for a pasta dinner. The squash ravioli was good. Would I go out of my way to come for this pasta dish again? No. Why? There were too many hazelnuts. On the menu they sounded luxurious, but they ended up tasting like a chock-full nut butter in your mouth. The sage did little to enhance this dish, which was drowning in butter. For $23 I wasn't overly pleased. I ventured to try the crostata that was mentioned in Wells' article too. Mistake. The dough was overworked and over baked with no flavor. The highlight was  the marscapone sitting on top, which I highly doubt Is made in house.  Although the vibe is perfectly trendy and romantic, I wouldn't have waited in the 30 minute line. Pass.

Food and drink delivery was well timed without being rushed. As many have mentioned, the pasta is what stands out.

I was expecting Lilia to be overrated given the social media hype it's gotten recently, but it really did blow me away with creative and seasonal takes on Italian classics. Lilia's reservations fill up weeks in advance, but I went with a friend as a walk in at 6:15 and were seated outside immediately. The outdoor tables were lovely and next to a public piano that was played by local musicians throughout our meal. We began the meal with the fresh mozzarella on garlic bread with lemon - a refreshing summer treat with tart lemon and creamy mozzarella! We then got the summer beans which were covered in spices, breadcrumbs and parmesan. And then onto the pastas... we got the mafaldini and the agnolotti. The mafaldini is what the internet has been raving about and I agree with the craze - it has beautiful waves and pink peppercorns to a bring a unique color to the dish, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. However, the agnolotti stole the show - it had a savory honey lemon saffron sauce that was memorable and the deep tastes lingered for hours.The waitress recommended we order 1 or 2 more dishes than we did, but we were both pleased with the amount of food.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10400,"Technically, my rating is a 3.8/5 though I'm rounding up to 4 because overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience with above average food. Here's why: Ambiance (5/5). The space is nice and intimate. It's perfect for a date or even a birthday. That said, reservations are tough to get, so plan accordingly. I was lucky enough to score a same day resy due to a last minute cancellation, but reservations are typically booked a month in advance. Food (3.5/5). Like I said, the food was above average, but for the price, we were expecting more. +The cacio e pepe fritters (which come 3 to an order) were disappointing. 2 of the 3 fritters were overcooked, leaving us with doughy fried balls. I know this wasn't the intention because the third fritter was divine, oozing with cheesy cacio e pepe-flavored goodness. I just wish all 3 of the fritters were cooked this way because that one ball (which my GF and I shared) was the highlight of our meal. + the artichoke appetizer was great. It's hard to go wrong with veggies smothered in cheese and bread crumbs. Yum. I would order this again. + For mains, we shared the sheep's milk agnolotti and the mafaldani. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and for the most part, the flavor was on point (side note: if you're not a fan of pepper, I would pass on the mafaldani, which is topped with a heavy helping of pink peppercorn). My biggest complaint was that the food became cold quickly, which made the pasta almost unpleasant to eat. The mafaldani was very light on sauce, so it just tasted dry and chewy as it got cold. + We shared the chocolate soft serve for dessert. The ice cream was served with hazelnuts, espresso, and candied lemon zest. It was a lovely flavor combination, though there were a few bites that were unbalanced. The lemon zest can be overpowering if you're not careful about the ratio of ingredients in each spoonful. Price (3/5): Lilia is a three dollar sign establishment, so it's certainly not a cheap meal. For two appetizers, two pastas, one dessert, two vodka sodas, and tip, our bill came out to $125. This wouldn't have bothered me if the food blew me away, but it didn't. Given all the hype around Lilia, I was surprised to experience the aforementioned issues (inconsistent cooking, cold food, etc.). These are all things that can be easily addressed, and if/when they are, I will gladly come back.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198366,"Had dinner here just last night. Booked the reservation online about a month ago. Had to settle for a 10:45PM reservation because the advance booking was full. My husband and I were looking forward to it because of the hype, publicity and proximity to home. We arrived 10mins early and were led to the back cafe for a drink and/or snack while we waited. The waiting cafe was fine, had to wait a while for our drink bc the place was busy. Small space, but thankful for any proper waiting space in this town.Only waited for about 15mins before we were sat. We were told the (Italian) restaurant was out of BREAD and a couple of other things from the specials list. It was late, but that was the only time we could book. The waiter was nice enough, I could tell we were one of his last tables and he was perfectly professional and patient.

I'll start with the positives: the restaurant is gorgeous with a lovely ambiance and simple, classy decor. They sat us without a reservation despite being fully booked, which was very accommodating. Unfortunately, the service and food were lacking. Our server was very quiet with no personality or smile and she offered us still or sparkling, no tap. It starts the experience off on the wrong foot to not offer tap water. This isn't Per Se or le Bernadin, it's Union avenue next to a car repair shop. I wish I could say the food was delicious but the prosciutto came with a bizarre intensely-flavored mustard dip that clashed with the taste of the prosciutto. The Parmesan butter that accompanied was quite good though. Our entrees were not impressive. The grilled tuna was a very small piece that was way too chewy and the grilled lamb was just a huge piece of gristle, although the fennel salad garnish was tasty.Maybe it's just growing pains and they will improve with time.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,66100,"In a neighborhood where finding a decent Italian restaurant is pretty difficult, Lilia doesn't exactly help the cause. First and foremost, let me preface this by saying that I will be back to give them another chance because they have so much promise (and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the grilled clams in 4 days). Aside from the beloved clams, we started with the house made mozzarella and the bagna cauda (which came with amazing grilled bread from their wood burning stove). First off, they should never serve something so mild as the mozzarella after the overwhelmingly strong and diverse flavors of the bagna cauda. If I couldn't quite put my finger on what ""nothing"" tasted like before, this mozz was now it. Not to mention, the thick piece of sesame seed bread did nothing for the dish. They would be better off having it standout on it's own or on a thinner crostini like toast. We then had the veal papardelle (rather pleasing, if not a bit too al dente) and the biggest let down of the night, the ricotta gnocchi. Thoughts of airy clouds and fluffy feather light pillows come to mind when I see ""ricotta gnocchi"" on a menu...these were dense and overworked and boiled in saltless water (or maybe it was the wrath of the bagna cauda again...). They just were not good, simple as that. Despite some of the pitfalls, the service was a delight and made our experience that much more enjoyable.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,11545,"I have to admit I was a bit excited getting reservations for Lilia since I eat Italian food pretty frequently, it was one I wanted to check off the list. I've heard so many good things as well as family and friends loving it too. Yes, its all amazingly fresh and tasty I'll give Lilia that. Perhaps I was too amped up from hearing all the rave reviews, but after all the hype I still thought it was just ehh, good. I don't mean that in a bad way because I still enjoyed our meal. Service: Service was good not exceptional. Forgot a few orders. Had to remind the wait staff. I'm not a picky person, but when too much time goes by.Very friendly staff. All smiles. Layout is cramped, tables are small. Not a lot of room for multiple dishes and a bottle of wine and extra glasses. I did dig the overall design of the restaurant, minimalist and well thought out. Just not much in the room of comfort. Food: All dishes are not exceptionally large, which gives you ability to try a little bit of everything. * Cacio E Pepe Fritters. Very good! Who doesn't love anything fried.* Mozzarella toasted garlic bread: Fresh mozzarella and a crostini type bread. Loved the addition of the lemon flavor but was a bit too over powering. Mozzarella was on point. * Olives: Good! but they're olives lol. * Radishes with ricotta: No complaints here! Very good whipped ricotta. * Rigatoni: Tasted fantastic, but nothing too exciting. Very standard dish. * Gnocchi: Nailed it. Wonderful full flavors. Can't go wrong with that pesto sauce. * Agnolotti: Suuuuuper rich but very tasty. Loved this. * Olive oil cake: Very soft and fluffy. Wine: A good selection with everything within in a reasonable price range. With some big players on the list as well. I do wish they would add more wines from the Campania region. More wine from this region would compliment the food even more. In the end. Lilia offers you a good standard quality meal which can't steer you wrong, Come here for a quick meal with no frills.

As probably the best female Italian chef, Missy had horned her skill at Spiaggia for five years and I could truly sense that from every single dish we had tried.Four of us had a 8:45 reservation and I had to admit I normally do not eat that late; Lilia was my exception. Shared a couple of small plates, grilled clam - chewy; cauliflower - juicy; trumpet mushroom - oh my god, meaty! Flawless! Pasta was certainly the part that one cannot miss. I would recommend to go with Fettuccine with the lamb sausage, with the pasta completely absorbed the broth, classic! Certainly, that was not to say that one should omit the fish or meat section; swordfish would not let you down and you would love that marinated pepper, such a great combo!Was that it? Of course not. Nothing can beat a cup of vanilla soft serve at the end of the meal. Make sure to add extra toppings (salted caramel). Lilia cafe was attached to Lilia restaurant, but towards the end of hallway.

Since they take reservations atleast a month in advance, we could not make reservations when we called 2 weeks ago. We were told to come in anyway as they take walk ins and we will get a table at the patio. We went amongst all the pasta hype but we were told that there would be a 2 hour wait. Too late to go somewhere else as we had our friends joining us, we started with an hour and a half long wait at the bar/cafeteria at the back with average wine. We finally got a table outside at the patio and started with the cacio fritter, foccacia and trumpet mushrooms. The starters were good and our server was attentive. What followed as the entree were confusing. We ordered 4 pasta dishes and ended up returning back the fettucine as it felt over drenched with peppercorn and way to undercooked.

While visiting New York, a fellow classmate of mine recommend I come for a pasta dinner. The squash ravioli was good. Would I go out of my way to come for this pasta dish again? No. Why? There were too many hazelnuts. On the menu they sounded luxurious, but they ended up tasting like a chock-full nut butter in your mouth. The sage did little to enhance this dish, which was drowning in butter. For $23 I wasn't overly pleased. I ventured to try the crostata that was mentioned in Wells' article too. Mistake. The dough was overworked and over baked with no flavor. The highlight was  the marscapone sitting on top, which I highly doubt Is made in house.  Although the vibe is perfectly trendy and romantic, I wouldn't have waited in the 30 minute line. Pass.

The first time, without a reservation, we were told by the host that the bar was ""first come, first serve"" seating. Excited to try the new place, we were happy to wait and the bartender was even kind enough to point out which spots he thought would be the next to free up. We waited over an hour near those seats - enjoyed a few glasses of wine, and even became chatty with the girls who were sitting there. When the girls finally left & the spots opened up, the host came over and said that we couldn't actually take those seats as they were reserved for someone else. SPECIAL SERVICE when you just told us that the bar was first come, first serve? Seriously? We managed to uncomfortably talk our way into the seats, but the entire situation was very snooty and unwelcoming for new (once excited) paying patrons. In an attempt to give Lilia the benefit of the doubt, I tried going back a second time about 6 months later - again as a walk-in cheery neighborhood customer. When we entered the restaurant, the hostess did not even look up and make eye contact before telling me that unless I had a reservation, they had no availability.

APERATIVI SALATI (Cocktail snacks)* Fritelle ($7) - 4.5 starsVery cheesy, can smell it immediately! Filling gooey & melty. Great slight crisp to the shell.

Spicy wasn't amazing, quite oily on bottom.  PESCI PICCOLI, ECC. (Little fish, etc.)* Cauliflower ($14) - 3.5 starsA bit underdone for me. Quality ingredients. The spicy flavor wasn't amazing with the cauliflower, and this had a layer of oil on the bottom of the dish.

I liked the texture; it was very interesting to chew on. * Fettuccine, spicy lamb sausage ($19) - 3.5 starsReally nicely done, but I could taste caraway seeds - that overwhelmed the flavor too much for me.

Sure the pasta is good, but it wasn't amazing. The portion sizes seem small but I was literally stuffed sharing 3 plates with my boyfriend ( I ate most of it). There's a line before the restaurant even opens on a Wednesday night. By 6p. all the available outside seating were gone. I recommend making reservations unless you get there before 5:30 to either sit at the bar or patio. Cacio e Pepe Fritelle ($7)-4/5 Three decent sized balls, these were soft and delightful. They're cheesy and comes out really hot. Sort of tastes like a lighter version of a fried mac and cheese ball. Mafaldini ($19)- 3/5 I fell in love with mafaldini at Leuca's and thought that this would be just as good but I was disappointed. It's cooked al dente and all you could really taste was the pink peppercorns. Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti ($23)- 4.5/5 This was probably the best dish, the only bad part was that it wasn't really hot, it was just warm when it came out.

Just a note for those planning to go, we were told the spot would be an hour wait, it was two, and I got a text about an hour before the spot was ready.We sat in the back bar and had beer and appetizers which were delicious. When we were seated at the bar, we ordered right away since we had time to think about what we wanted. The bartender suggested an appetizer, which I'm glad she did because it was delicious and the main dishes were smaller than I expected.I didn't read reviews before I went, which I'm glad since the place should be judged by the food and not everything else people are writing. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the appetizers portions seemed mismatched, I had one piece of toast w cheese on it while my friend had an entire plate with bread, meat and butter, yet they were the same price.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,49015,"Pasta done perfectly!In my opinion definitely deserving of all the accolades it's gotten. Reservations through Resy were a cinch, and probably not as hard to come by now these days compared to when the place first opened. The space itself is gorgeous and warm - actually taking over the space of an old auto shop. Quite casual and unpretentious. Option to sit outdoors along the street is nice too (especially because sometimes it gets really, really hot inside).Quick rundown of the food that we got: cacio e pepe fritter was good, but wasn't mind blowing - I think partly because my expectations were so high after everyone mentioning it in their reviews. Whole artichoke was excellent - served open faced with this hot/garlicky oil that was super delicious. Agnolotti - omg, that cheese filling was out of this world! Mafaldini was exceptional - the pasta had the perfect texture/bite and that peppery goodness...wow (probably our favorite of the night). Rigatoni was very good, but I think was not as memorable as the agnolotti and mafaldini.Only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me was the service. It was passable, but our waiter seemed really aloof/disinterested and never smiled the entire time....then again, it was pretty late in the day so he could have been worn out.

Great starter- you can't really go wrong with fried dough. Cauliflower: so many flavors, so delicious, perfect. Grilled ramps: ramps are so trendy and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. This wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away. Grilled Scallops: I love scallops, and this was an interesting preparation with yogurt and walnuts. I wish the flavors had a bigger punch. Blowfish tails: sounded good but didn't turn out to be what I imagined. The fish were had lots of bones and the accompanying gremolata fell flat. Rigatoni: a comforting classic with a bit of heat. Malfadini: my favorite dish! I love the shape of the pasta. It's simple, satisfying, and I just don't know how it can be so good with such minimal ingredients. Agnolotti: cheese-filled pillows, delicate fragrant sauce. It's what dreams are made of.Pappardelle: another classic, but I wasn't as impressed with this.

The service was great and the food was better. We ordered enough for a small village and were completely satisfied. The pink peppercorn pasta was delicious along with the two others we ordered.

But then everyone talks glowingly about the pastas.  The NYT called the gnocchi:   ""tender cheese dumplings that seem to be held together by nothing but the force of Ms. Robbins's will.""  Since gnocchi is among my favorite dishes, I had to try it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Not very tender and certainly not supple as great gnocchi is.  As for the chocolate dessert.  It was more like a dried out cake with no rich chocolate taste that one might expect.  The bread by the way, was also dried out as if it were day old.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary cup of ice cream given for the half hour wait.My husband fared better. He loved his fennel salad and his black bass with saved the evening.  So order wisely if you go, and be prepared to wait for your table.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"chief,reservation,reviews,restaurant,Lilia,New York Times,restaurant,effort,regular,A Voce,Missy Robbins,fan,Little Gem Salad,husband,nothing,part,vinegar content,restaurant,restaurant,chocolate taste,stars,millennials,everyone,table,gnocchi,wait,meal,Voce,bread,gnocchi,will,Williamsburg,sand,grains,bread crumbs,romaine,croutons,butter,lettuce,pastas,force,tender cheese dumplings,dishes,meal,way,ice cream,fennel salad,table,bass,gnocchi,wait.My,truth,chocolate dessert,cake","1,7,5,2,1,3,2,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.216200336814,0.120028473437,0.0551152974367,0.0549951791763,0.0444643981755,0.043306235224,0.0430029779673,0.0409197472036,0.0331016257405,0.0278500188142,0.0259090811014,0.023399984464,0.0208319760859,0.0180785357952,0.0173274427652,0.0145128676668,0.0127174323425,0.0101675102487,0.0100788911805,0.00990974716842,0.00764960236847,0.00745857553557,0.0071981032379,0.00702985329553,0.00700245751068,0.00683846464381,0.00661767274141,0.0062861237675,0.00601243600249,0.00572612695396,0.00520890252665,0.00505084125325,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.00499458611012,0.00499458611012,0.00499458611012,0.00456417072564,0.0045580859296,0.0045580859296,0.00455258833244,0.00386674120091,0.0033859545365,0.00338335498236,0.00277951732278,0.00267399405129,0.00234115659259,0.00229262141511,0.00158533081412,0.00149090087507,0.0014879895607,0.00148668838665"

The tablespoons of butter that blanketed the oiled bread was not necessary and ruined the dish.The clams were good. Too me they were a better version of clam oreganata.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,2742,"I'm so torn about this review because if I was rating Lilia solely based on the food and drinks, it would've been 5 stars! Throughout the meal, I was so excited about the everything I ate and drank. Unfortunately, the service was bad enough that it knocks off several stars. We had quite a spread between the two of us--and was dining for a celebratory occasion, so we were in very good spirits. We were walk-ins on a Friday night, and the wait was about an hour, which was just enough time to have a couple delightful cocktails from the cafe in the back. For food, we ordered:- cured sardines on toast - flavorful and surprising - scallops - plump and fresh- potatoes with shaved black truffle - decadent - fettuccine with lamb - bright taste of tomatoes, savory lamb sausage, and handmade fettuccine- mafaldini with pink peppercorn - star of the night, just simple and great textureJust everything was a hit! And I was already raving about the meal from the perfect negroni I had to start. We were even talking about Lilia stands strong next to other Italian powerhouse restaurants such as Babbo.  Despite the superb kitchen.... Our waitress must have been drunk or something. Upon first greeting us, she knocked a candle and spilled hot wax towards us. She forgot to bring us our bar snacks. We ordered wine and she was distracted talking to other guests/friends in the middle of pouring a glass. No joke, it took 10 mins for her to pour 1 glass of wine. Unfortunately, in the fettuccine, my husband bit into something hard and thought he chipped a tooth when he spat out a piece of ceramic. It turned out to be a piece of a broken bowl. We notified the waitress to which she responded immediately ""I'll get you another one."" Didn't apologize for the situation, and acted like it was just a usual occurrence. Someone from the kitchen actually brought out the replacement dish and sincerely apologized. When we asked for the bill, we did expect the fettuccine to be removed from the bill. I suppose by the food, I was putting Lilia up there with the Jean Georges or Mario Batali type establishments, which would try to find resolution to the mishap. Nope -- not only was the fettuccine still on the bill, we also had an EXTRA appetizer and 3 EXTRA drinks on the bill that we didn't have! The waitress came back around almost annoyed that we asked the bill to be corrected. The entire meal, we gave so many passes and continued to enjoy the meal even with the mishaps-- but at this point, poor service was evident. The bill came back, corrected, and we decided to tip 20% on everything except for the fettuccine (mind you, bill was still $200). The waitress hovered and watched as to pressure, and she made it a point to grab the check and look at it while we putting our coats on. She then said ""get home safe"" in a way that read ""go f* youself.""  Our waitress wasn't the only one with the attitude. We sat by the door and someone came to offer us blankets due to the cold draft--super cute idea, but when we declined she rolled her eyes as if we made some sort of inconvenience for her. Upon arriving, there was a lady on the phone giving mouth to a customer on the phone about how busy they usually are. The service here really spoiled one of the best pasta meals I've had in awhile.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198573,"I don't write many reviews but after my 3rd and final visit to Lilia, I felt compelled to. The food at Lilia is pretty damn good, as everyone has read, however the experience is not one that I have the desire to repeat. I've eaten a lot of the items off the menu, never had anything bad. I had the Spaghetti with lemon and parmigiano last night, which is definitely the weakest of all the dishes I've had. I love the rigatoni most out of the pastas. I don't think the ground lamb sausage goes very well with fettuccine. The lamb is great but eating ground sausage with that kind of pasta tends to leave you eating the pasta and then having a bowl of sausage at the end. It would go better with a pasta that the sausage would stick to. I enjoyed the olives and clams, but the best thing I've eaten at Lilia is the ramp focaccia that was just a seasonal thing but it was really exceptional. Onto the not so service...I understand that this place has gotten great reviews causing a lot of hype. Getting a reservation is strange because they really don't put many online at all. I've had to go in every time to get one (or call). Overall, this wait staff is probably my least favorite I've encountered in as long as I can remember. They consistently carry themselves as if they're doing you a favor by letting you eat at their restaurant. I take great pride in being respectful at restaurants because I truly do respect everything that goes into the food we eat. I have never felt that reciprocated from the staff at Lilia.One example of this is when I was told that I had to place my entire order at once and wasn't allowed to order any additional items once the ticket went into the kitchen. I've never been told this in my life....If I enjoy the pasta you made so much, I can't order more of it after I finish? That's completely bizarre and I can't image is the actual policy of the restaurant. It would seem more likely that a waitress perhaps didn't think my girlfriend and I would run up a big bill, because we look younger, and wanted to turn the table.Another example was my waiter last night. Four of us ordered, one member of the party decided to order two appetizers as an entree, the mushrooms and scallops. My friend ordered the chicken and my girlfriend and I ordered pasta. The waiter mentioned, aggressively, that the scallops were small and my friends girlfriend said she is ok with that. Then the waiter said that Lilia is a restaurant where people are meant to share things, which is something I have never been told at Lilia. He went on to say he would like to send out the two appetizers along with the olives and clams we ordered, first - then follow with the two pastas and chicken to share. When we expressed that wasn't what we wanted initially he pushed back rather aggressively.  Basically, he wanted to decide not only how we eat, but what we eat. I think it's pretty common knowledge that if customers wants to share dishes, they can do so. That's not what we wanted to do. None of us are vegetarians but he doesn't know that, maybe that's why we don't want to share the chicken? Perhaps someone is lactose intolerant?He mentioned the scallops being small at least 2 more times. When My girlfriend and I asserted that we want the food the way we ordered, the waiter got an attitude that I found to be totally unacceptable. We were then ignored for the rest of our meal, outside of one drink refill that I had to initiate. Outside of being ignored, we all felt that this waiter was treating us as if we didn't belong there from the second we sat down. I think Lilia makes good food and you should go ahead and try it if you're curious. My suggestion would be to try the bar to avoid their waiters, if you must go. For me however, I will never be entering those doors again. There are far too many restaurants in this city that I have experienced wonderful service and eaten fantastic food in, to waste time on a place that employs a staff that can ruin a good plate of pasta for me....which I didn't think was possible.I'll be going to Sauce or Babbo next time.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,17.3999996185,"Lilia,Spaghetti,ramp focaccia,reviews,girlfriend,ground lamb sausage,visit,waiter,food,pastas,pasta,policy,experience,waiter,Lilia.One,everything,everyone,items,lot,dishes,restaurant,things,rigatoni,desire,menu,anything,parmigiano,lemon,girlfriend,restaurants,appetizers,pasta,someone,pasta,place,lamb,sausage,sausage,drink refill,clams,reviews,lot,service,place,waitress,olives,pasta,waiter,wait staff,restaurant,restaurants,restaurant,fettuccine,pasta,end,bowl,kind,hype,reservation,food,favorite,something,ticket,attitude,staff,example,pride,scallops,chicken,favor,example,items,more,friend,friends,rest,call,kitchen,order,life,chicken,food,times,mushrooms,entree,party,people,member,ground sausage,bar,food,waiters,pasta,scallops,way,meal,second,service,staff,suggestion,food,bill,scallops,pastas,doors,plate,city,vegetarians,dishes,chicken,clams,olives,knowledge,customers,None,Sauce,Babbo","1,7,7,5,1,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,6,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,4,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,1,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,2","0.108919613063,0.106063455343,0.0822567716241,0.0395690836012,0.0326759591699,0.0237601604313,0.0234529245645,0.0210376512259,0.0196224749088,0.0181047786027,0.0175054967403,0.0143810361624,0.0136771397665,0.0135963214561,0.013577026315,0.0130572710186,0.012764910236,0.0126996133476,0.0126996133476,0.0126534858719,0.012195543386,0.0115133496001,0.0114695718512,0.0111711267382,0.0111139593646,0.0111139593646,0.0110735753551,0.0110735753551,0.0099977273494,0.00946371536702,0.00797794014215,0.00689202267677,0.00678685866296,0.00671960879117,0.00663598207757,0.00587787898257,0.00567886047065,0.00566925993189,0.00484460080042,0.0047839093022,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477280886844,0.00472366111353,0.00454327464104,0.00447973422706,0.00432876264676,0.0042459401302,0.00424222880974,0.00423243595287,0.00420712446794,0.00419930554926,0.00419891206548,0.00419891206548,0.00419891206548,0.00417997082695,0.00417492398992,0.0040320912376,0.00398742733523,0.00362253934145,0.00361431972124,0.00357530592009,0.00352480495349,0.00349580752663,0.00326838996261,0.00321635324508,0.00321436417289,0.00321133877151,0.00320590659976,0.00320590659976,0.00320344325155,0.00292353169061,0.0029218075797,0.00287240254693,0.00281503563747,0.00280478573404,0.00280478573404,0.00280263042077,0.00274940021336,0.00273117190227,0.0025729064364,0.00255930167623,0.00255930167623,0.00255930167623,0.00255476962775,0.00243272050284,0.00242881756276,0.00218247645535,0.00216891081072,0.00215787207708,0.00215635192581,0.00210569472983,0.00190121261403,0.00190044718329,0.00189970561769,0.00172574282624,0.00165038381238,0.00160973297898,0.00146538205445,0.00141098932363,0.00139100139495,0.00137341930531,0.00131358671933,0.00131313025486,0.00131313025486,0.00126801093575,0.00109747250099,0.00105111068115,0.000955960247666,0.000955960247666,0.000835043378174,0.000824516639113,0.000783009687439,0.000777130015194,0.000777130015194"

She was never at our table for more than a minute, kept telling us she had to leave and be right back, and charged us for things we didn't even order. We wanted to surprise our friend for dessert and she brought out silverware and plates way before the cake which obviously ruined the surprise, then brought out an extra dessert we didn't order and charged us for it.We all felt extremely weird and awkward the entire dinner, and by the time we left it was almost midnight.

I am a huge foodie, own 3 restaurants, & i was SUPER EXCITED to try this place after all the hype and reviews. First of all, my parents are both Sicilian straight off the boat, and my mother cooks killer Sicilian food all of the time. So im not sure if it's my high standards, but my entire meal was NOT impressive at all. My boyfriend and I drove 40 minutes from Jersey City to Brooklyn last night for this meal, which I could not wait for. We ordered the Cacio e Pepe fritelle, roasted mushrooms, grilled clams, grilled blowfish tails, Malfaldini, & the Agnelotti. The best thing about my meal was dipping bread (which I had to ask for) into the olive oil which the grilled blowfish was in. Seriously so disappointed. The malfaldini tasted like straight pepper & ONLY pepper, as well as the Cacio e Pepe fritelle. So bland, besides the extreme amount of pepper which was all you tasted. I also paid $11 PER GLASS for each glass of Moscato, which was the tiniest wine glass I have ever seen, probably 2 sips of each was all it took to finish. I cannot believe all of the positive reviews on this place. I can cook better Italian food at my house!! 30 day wait to get a reservation?? Makes me so mad. I can get better Italian food at many other places, & wouldnt have to wait so long for a reservation either! $162 to the FACE.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,31202,"Extremely overhyped and overpriced is the best and nicest way that I can describe Lilia Caffe. It's been awhile since I've been disappointed in a restaurant - fault on my end as I should have known from the previous reviews warning of bad service and food being served warm. However, Lilia lured me in with people's constant pictures of the Mafaldini and agnolotti. Plus, it's a hassle in itself to lock down a reservation at a normal before 10:30 pm (you'll need to plan a month in advance), adding to the hype. Trust me, Lilia is aware of its social standing as my first encounter with an employee was when I attempted to cancel an existing reservation - the hostess was extremely rude and thought it was attempting to make a reservation and said they were completely booked that day, have a nice day, and hung up immediately. Uh okay? I didn't let any of this bother me as I was still excited to try the 2 dishes mentioned above, along with the cacio e pepe balls, which was also a popular item. Our cacio e pepe appetizer arrived warm, unlike the usual fried items that come piping hot. Flavor wise, we both agreed that we didn't taste anything but parmesan cheese - a bit disappointing there. Like the appetizer, both the mafaldini and the agnolotti arrived luke warm if at best - we both were shocked at how small the portion sizes were given a $19 price tag.. They both lacked in taste too that I can't really describe them. Service really lacks here. Upon ordering the 3 dishes our waiter gave us a look and rudely kept attempting to get us to order more; in the end he left shunning us as we denied his suggestion. On top of that, after our table was cleared, we informed the waiter that we didn't want dessert and the check would be fine - he came back and obnoxiously shoved the dessert menu in my face..then when I respectfully declined, he yelled ""I BETTER NOT SEE YOU ACROSS THE STREET!""..so awkward.

(4/5)Grilled Clams - There were 12 clams already deshelled and nicely laid out on their shells for ease of eating.  The flavors of the chili were strong but not spicy.  I expected it to have more a of kick.  The roasted breadcrumbs were a nice add of texture.  Overall, this dish was good but I would like to try something else next time. (3/5)Fettuccine - pretty large size portion for me and my bf to share. The noodles were perfectly cooked.  It was a  nice ratio for the meat sauce to noodle.  The little pieces of lamb sausage was a nice protein add to the pasta and it did not taste gamey at all. I would choose this dish again if we had more people but would also like to try other pasta dishes next time.(4/5)Olive Oil Cake - persimmons with a light whip cream.  The cake was moist but some parts of the cake were a bit hard on the edges.  The persimmons added a nice flavor of fall to the cake.  I would like to try other desserts next time i'm back.  (3.5/5)",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,11.1000003815,"dining room,cheese,bar,following,Cacio e Pepe FritelleCauliflower,Spicy Soppressata,spots,something,inside,pasta dishes,clams,Cauliflower,dish,ratio,persimmons,pesto flavors,pesto,Clams,cake,cauliflower,soppressata,chili,MajoramGrilled Clams,Sicilian Pesto,Calabrian Chili,Fennel SeedOlive Oil CakeThe Cacio e Pepe,Spicy Lamb Sausage,BreadcrumbsFettuccine,appetizer,bite,pops,eating,ease,shells,dish,kick,texture,add,Tomato Passato,desserts,people,whip cream,cake,cake,persimmons,flavor,Olive Oil Cake,protein,flavors,edges,breadcrumbs,pieces,noodles,noodle,pasta,lamb sausage,size portion,bf,meat sauce,parts","2,7,2,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.109936058521,0.0637849196792,0.0527627468109,0.0524945929646,0.037206813693,0.0356200262904,0.0229621101171,0.0202687270939,0.0201324447989,0.0189541764557,0.0185976866633,0.0183919649571,0.0183238368481,0.0175081323832,0.0172433983535,0.0169360879809,0.0169030949473,0.0168494451791,0.0155773106962,0.0154069429263,0.0153769208118,0.0153076797724,0.0149882044643,0.0149882044643,0.0136344907805,0.0136344907805,0.0136344907805,0.0136344907805,0.0135520305485,0.0134563762695,0.0134563762695,0.0134136388078,0.0134136388078,0.0134136388078,0.0131328450516,0.0122450040653,0.0122315222397,0.0122315222397,0.0119310934097,0.0104330508038,0.00909388624132,0.00909388624132,0.00903759617358,0.0090317260474,0.00902922917157,0.00790252909064,0.00773382699117,0.00769951427355,0.00729556707665,0.00629308260977,0.0060584130697,0.00476827751845,0.00457100151107,0.00456726271659,0.00456375349313,0.00456375349313,0.00400259857997,0.00400259857997,0.00399582739919,0.00272545148619"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,64795,"All-around amazing restaurant experience. Got a late reservation on a Friday night and went with my boyfriend for a date night. We had to wait a bit for our table but helped ourselves to a cocktail and espresso at the cafe part in the back. Other than the extra wait, the ambiance, service, and most importantly FOOD were all spectacular. My boyfriend and I ordered a lot to share (like 5 dishes not including dessert...) but somehow our waiter timed the courses perfectly.

I had brought a bottle of wine to celebrate my friends birthday and the Somm was still very gracious. We each started with a glass of bubbly, the franciacorta, which was amazing. Everything on the menu sounded so good we wanted it all. We started with the cacio e pepe fritters which are a must. A fried ball of cheese, noodles? and prosciutto...how can you go wrong?? We also ordered the  Cauliflower, Spicy Soppressata, Sicilian Pesto, Majoram which was another winner. The scallops under the little fishes were spot on and I'm not a big scallop fan. The portions are large so by the time our pasta dishes arrived we were pretty full. We ordered the Rigatoni Diavola, San Marzanos, Chilies, Oregano, Pecorino, which was easily the best diavola I've ever had and the Mafaldini, Pink Peppercorns, Parmigiano Reggiano, which sounds so simple but the flavors are so complex.

We had to wait a bit for our table but helped ourselves to a cocktail and espresso at the cafe part in the back. Other than the extra wait, the ambiance, service, and most importantly FOOD were all spectacular. My boyfriend and I ordered a lot to share (like 5 dishes not including dessert...) but somehow our waiter timed the courses perfectly. Some food highlights: the artichoke was different but so delicious, the gnocchi (not to be that guy) reminded me of the gnocchi I last had in France, and the VEAL was the best thing I've ever tasted.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,11372,"This is a two stars that could be a three, but hell, why should we be too generous? I already left a much bigger tip than I should have. So here it is:Food: totally decent. Not amazing, but solid italian food, they know pasta should be al dente and it is. Seems like good quality control in the kitchen. A bit too much salt in general. A bit too much sugar in deserts too. Appetizers and deserts were good, but nothing outstanding, let say I'd give it a 4 stars for the food.Wine: just tried one, but it made us happy. A totally ok Nebbiolo from Val d'Aoste at a reasonable price. Wine menu is ok, and don't go wild on the price. I'd go 4 stars.Landscape: that's just super weird. Clearly williamsburgish post 2015. I counted and really, I think the staff was like 25 to 30 heads. Ultimately, it should not be a problem for the clientele, but the thing is they are all hanging out there, in front of you, checking on you, and feeling a bit unoccupied. Really weird feeling honestly. Some of them look so much like in a video for a Williamsburg commercial, the mast brothers or the timmy brothers may be... that... hmm... does'nt feel right for an italian restaurant. And, gosh, Union avenue, what happened to you? Between the BQE and Mc Carren Park must be the worst architectural accomplishment of Brooklyn over the last decade. I'd give a 1 or 2 stars for the landscape.Coffee. My espresso was actually absolutely perfect. Looks like they use beans from Joe, they said. Well, that was a good damn espresso like I rarely find in NY even using fancy small batch roasters. 5 stars here.Service: That's probably the drama. Checking on us literally every minute. Removing plates when you are not done. Removing wine glasses when the bottle is not finished. Speaking like a machine with a total lack of people intelligence and no empathy what so ever (hey, please, stop speaking to my french mum, she told you she could not understand you at all). It's a 1 star. Wonder why I left the tip I left, really. But, at the end of the day, what I take away is that this place is absolutely empty of any soul. Has no personality at all. I respect the fact that it's relatively quality food, and that prices could have been higher for such a new spot in Wburg (actually, I wonder how they make money with such a staff, and a space I don't want to know the price of...).But, yes, in the end, a restaurant without soul, without character is very sad and that's probably why I give only 2 stars.(oh and yes, prices are reasonables in general, but please don't sell this grappa from Poli that price - 17 $ - it's way too much)",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,14.3999996185,"stars,espresso,Food,fact,bit,pasta,tip,nothing,quality control,kitchen,Landscape,italian food,Some,price,avenue,bit,menu,deserts,deserts,stars,prices,price,salt,sugar,Nebbiolo,star,stars,mast brothers,grappa,staff,espresso,problem,thing,accomplishment,italian restaurant,brothers,stars,heads,clientele,front,feeling,commercial,video,Service,Coffee,Looks,beans,Val d'Aoste,place,soul,staff,empathy,price,personality,spot,prices,Appetizers,Williamsburg,Union,Brooklyn,Mc Carren Park,BQE,space,Joe,NY,soul,restaurant,end,money,character,reasonables,tip,plates,wine glasses,bottle,people intelligence,mum,lack,machine,Poli","7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,7,1,7,6,1","0.284713119268,0.0742467418313,0.0315809138119,0.0299580954015,0.0290995314717,0.0285127051175,0.0236682891846,0.0233352184296,0.0232366751879,0.0232366751879,0.0201114434749,0.0173891671002,0.0143120186403,0.0133235724643,0.0114166839048,0.011118545197,0.0107888234779,0.0101141855121,0.0100971031934,0.00990737229586,0.00955913122743,0.00898766238242,0.00886771921068,0.00885042734444,0.0088223060593,0.00858130026609,0.00850956421345,0.00827752053738,0.00823588576168,0.00809173844755,0.00736489146948,0.00725512532517,0.00725512532517,0.00723206531256,0.00675899581984,0.00675899581984,0.00605582911521,0.00592946680263,0.00592390121892,0.00592390121892,0.00591872446239,0.00591388624161,0.00591388624161,0.00545883085579,0.00540011143312,0.00539326667786,0.00539326667786,0.00522485654801,0.00491525791585,0.00458672223613,0.00458284653723,0.00449306610972,0.00419530179352,0.00401124358177,0.00400957651436,0.00393763557076,0.00382849108428,0.00350142573006,0.00349873537198,0.00349620077759,0.00349620077759,0.00349620077759,0.00340032484382,0.00319302501157,0.00319114211015,0.00317297200672,0.00317297200672,0.00317297200672,0.00311153265648,0.002775949426,0.00260540400632,0.00177285901736,0.00176415697206,0.00176324381027,0.00176324381027,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00164306128863"

The first time, without a reservation, we were told by the host that the bar was ""first come, first serve"" seating. Excited to try the new place, we were happy to wait and the bartender was even kind enough to point out which spots he thought would be the next to free up. We waited over an hour near those seats - enjoyed a few glasses of wine, and even became chatty with the girls who were sitting there. When the girls finally left & the spots opened up, the host came over and said that we couldn't actually take those seats as they were reserved for someone else. SPECIAL SERVICE when you just told us that the bar was first come, first serve? Seriously? We managed to uncomfortably talk our way into the seats, but the entire situation was very snooty and unwelcoming for new (once excited) paying patrons. In an attempt to give Lilia the benefit of the doubt, I tried going back a second time about 6 months later - again as a walk-in cheery neighborhood customer. When we entered the restaurant, the hostess did not even look up and make eye contact before telling me that unless I had a reservation, they had no availability. I asked about the bar seats again, and in an annoyed manner she told me that they had a waitlist for the bar + outside seating. I kindly said we'd prefer the bar, & she quickly exclaimed, the bar is a much longer wait. Did not even quote a time. No smile. No eye contact. Just rude service.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198778,I am not sure where to begin. This is easily my favorite restaurant. The pasta is insane but I am going to take a minute and give a shout out to the lamb leg steak. It takes my breath away every time. DO NOT go the rest of your life with out tasting this dish. My only criticism is they should train the servers on a proper wine pour. It's inconsistent and often times an ounce or two less than it should be.

While it was kind of fatty, the meat was seasoned nicely and had a good flavor. The potatoes that accompanied the steak were also quite good.Wish I could say the same for the bass we also ordered.  The fish itself wasn't bad but the green sauce they smothered it on top with was not enjoyable.Lastly we ordered lattes and a piece of the chocolate torta to share. Had I realized it was just a piece of flourless cake with a bit of espresso sauce, I wouldn't have ordered it.  The coffees were not to my liking as well.This dinner with tip and tax for the 3 of us came to $275.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should have stuck to the pastas.

The cacio e Pepe and grilled squid are worth a shot if you're extra hungry but would recommend against ordering the swordfish based solely on stomach capacity. All the pastas are amazing though. Definitely returning to try the other 3. Only downside is the current hype (hopefully temporary since the place just opened). The lines are insane and it is nearly impossible to get a reservation at a reasonable time. I came here on a Sunday at 9:30 PM on a reservation made weeks in advance. I tried to eat at Lilia a week before then as well on a Tuesday evening thinking the lines would be reasonable due to it being a weekday. Instead, I ended up waiting in their waiting area for two hours, where you cannot order food, before leaving because I was told their line wasn't getting any shorter and was starving. In sum, make a reservation and pig out on their pastas.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,7.59999990463,"pasta,pasta,pastas,place,Missy Robins,downside,one,restaurants,Word,advice,squid,all,place,Chicago,Spiaggia,line,parts,menu,appetizers,dishes,reservation,pastas,cacio e pepe,swordfish,swordfish,bunch,lines,lines,malfadini,agnolotti,rigatoni,stomach capacity,shot,waiting area,cacio e Pepe,food,sum,pig,reservation,reservation,advance,Lilia","7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.19672344625,0.0923688262701,0.0877214446664,0.0837203040719,0.0805505886674,0.0353209711611,0.0297660175711,0.0297660175711,0.0296150743961,0.0296150743961,0.0293185245246,0.0220573116094,0.0189425926656,0.0176995359361,0.0176995359361,0.0123549550772,0.0113320490345,0.0113320490345,0.0113320490345,0.0113320490345,0.011204732582,0.0107753109187,0.00872557982802,0.00872557982802,0.0087054874748,0.00836694333702,0.00816885847598,0.00794646237046,0.00763640599325,0.00763640599325,0.00763640599325,0.00761881330982,0.00761881330982,0.0051609701477,0.00484215747565,0.00357433455065,0.00357097992674,0.00357097992674,0.00348258344457,0.00285212113522,0.00226963078603,0.00134203629568"

Finally snagged a reservation for a late dinner on Sunday night at 9:30.I am obsessed with the venue and the ambiance of the hotel. The lighting was cozy and it was quiet enough for good conversation. Our service was also great and our waitress provided us with good recommendations based on the types of food we wanted to eat. Sadly, the clams were out by the time we arrived, but she was able to give us a great alternative.We each ordered a glass of wine as well as the artichoke to start with. Although messy to eat, the artichoke was pretty tasty, but I would probably order something else to start with the next time I come. The cauliflower looked good as well as the mushrooms.Per our waitress' recommendation after we found out the clams were no longer, we ordered the crispy little fish which were very very good to begin with. After waiting a bit, our pastas came out!! The highlight of the meal! We ordered the famously photographed peppercorn Malfadini, which was simple yet so delicious. Love the seasoning. To balance, we also got the pappardelle with the veal bolognese which was also very delicious. The pasta tasted fresh and overall, we had enough food for two people to split well.Only reason I'm detracting a star is because for the hefty price tag of the meal in the end...nothing was WOW or mindblowing.

Similar to our first visit, the pastas were good but not incredible - but, we really loved our appetizers - especially the baked clams and the mozzarella toast.  End your meal with the soft-serve gelato - such a treat on a warm night.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",1,0,0.600000023842,3.0,"Seth,visit,A+,Lilia,pace,reservation,bit,meal,food,table,pace,restaurant,seatings,order,appetizers,clams,mozzarella toast,tables,meal,treat,visit,pastas","1,4,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,4,7","0.200270473957,0.180233582854,0.0960120931268,0.0960120931268,0.0902884751558,0.0473764725029,0.0410811975598,0.0408463552594,0.0235202778131,0.0211432240903,0.0211432240903,0.020323690027,0.0202200803906,0.0185118764639,0.0143299242482,0.0137970820069,0.0137970820069,0.0111057544127,0.0108956228942,0.00953564140946,0.00692877592519,0.00262700160965"

A solid 10. It was a simple toasted Italian bread with a slice of mozzarella and it was slightly melted and had some garlic,salt and spices. It was fantastic and set the bar really high.Next we split a pasta dish and fish. Even though I ate there less than 48 hours ago I don't remember either dish enough to provide more detail.

We walked in at 6:00 on the dot and were told there were tables outside available - amazing! That did mean that we didn't get to soak up the cool vibe indoors (though I did scope it out on my bathroom visit) but it was worth it to not wait. We ordered the cacio e pepe fritelle, the prosciutto served with mustard and parmesan butter (the butter was the highlight here, not joking), my mom got black bass with salsa verde and I went with the saffron agnolotti, of course. With the exception of the cacio e pepe, which we never received (we could have pointed this out but at this point I was full from prosciutto and butter and hadn't even gotten to my pasta yet) everything was amazing. I will say the pasta was very interesting and I don't know that I was crazy about the mix of saffron with sheep's milk cheese, but it was still delicious. My mom loved her fish (and also, portions were pretty decent given that this is a trendy NYC spot) and we split the olive oil cake for dessert, which was awesome.

I would have drank the minty garlicky broth that it was swimming in, had that been socially acceptable.We then had the Sheeps milk cheese filled agnolotti, which was topped with a sweet and salty sauce. This was followed by the Sea Bass as our final course; it was perfectly crisp from being wood fired and topped with a fresh salsa verde.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199077,"Lilia. Oh. Oh my,While in NYC for meetings I decided to make a short pilgrimage to Williamsburg to see what all the to-do was about. Now I know. The magic of the once-otherworldly Spiaggia and Cafe Spiaggia in Chicago is back, only it's now a few miles east. In Brooklyn.The place is warm and welcoming, and very much has the feel of a casual neighborhood spot while still being just elegant enough. There is a huge open kitchen that runs almost the entire length of the restaurant, with a huge wood-burning grill at one end and an army of cooks along the line turning out amazing food. The whole operation is visible and it's a little hard to believe that this place just opened, because it seems to run like a well-tuned machine.I sat with a friend at the bar and got friendly and attentive service. The bartenders and servers were thoroughly versed in every item on the menu, and from the reactions when I asked about a few dishes, I got the sense that they were truly passionate about the food. This did not bode well for me restraining myself. Here we go: - Beverages: I got the obligatory Negroni and as expected it was perfect. With dinner I had a glass of Falanghina and later a Nebbiolo. The cocktail and wine lists seemed to have just the right number of options and prices were all reasonable. - Cacio e Pepe Fritelle (easy for you to say): In other words, cheese and pepper doughnut. This was one of those rare fried things that somehow manages to be as light as a popover. Savory, delicious.- Roasted trumpet mushrooms: this was when I started saying to myself things like ""Holy $&%# this is good"" and ""&@!*"" and such. I told myself I was going to sample a bunch of stuff, that wasn't going to finish everything I ordered, and failed right out of the gate.- Scallops: first item from the wood grill. Perfectly cooked, perfectly balanced prep. I didn't know whether to eat them or roll around in them.- Tuna was also perfectly grilled on the outside edges and beautifully deep red.- We also tried a couple of pasta dishes in between those last two. I'm a sucker for anything fra diavolo, and there it was on the menu staring at me. My friend ordered the gnocchi, which took me back to a great lunch I had years ago at a little seaside restaurant in Italy.- Dessert: some ridiculously good, buttery, apple tart kind of thing. More expletives.Like the wine, I thought everything on the menu was very reasonably priced. Add the quality and presentation of the food and it's an amazing value.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,101795,"I've been dying to come here ever since the hype, and I finally made it all the way to Williamsburg this past Tuesday. We arrived at around 6:50pm and were told that the dining room was entirely booked, but it would be about a 45 minute wait for the bar. Since I was expecting a much longer wait after everything I've read, I was pretty pleased with this. We started taking a walk around a very nice park nearby, but less than 15 (or 20?) minutes later, we already received a text that our two bar seats were ready. Unfortunately, we didn't get to actually sit in those seats--there was a mix-up because they offered the seats to the guy in front of us on the waiting list, but his dining companion hadn't arrived, so they texted us instead. Apparently she arrived shortly after we reappeared, because after showing us the promised seats and saying we could sit once they threw down table settings, they ended up giving the seats to the other couple instead. So we had to wait around for the next two seats to open...which I suppose is a genuine mix-up, and they were apologetic, but somewhat annoying all the same. As for the food, the reason I wanted to come was the very hyped up malfadini and the cacio e pepe fritters. i ended up liking them well enough--the pasta was cooked very well, the fritters were soft and fluffy--but I would never order them again. I love pepper, but these were so over-peppered that the flavors of each dish were completely overpowered. It was a pretty flat disappointment, for me. However, I did like the sheep's milk agnolotti even though I don't typically go for ravioli-type pastas. The slightly honey sweet sauce was perfect for the sheep's milk filling. To finish, the olive oil cake was perfectly fine, but what really made it special was that ridiculously creamy dollop of whipped cream on top.Overall, Lilia was fine, but I probably wouldn't make the trek to eat there again. It's definitely one of the pitfalls of hype...lots of customers, but lots of high expectations to meet. I will say, though, that I didn't have any issues with the waitstaff. They were fairly nice. I can see how they might come off as aloof (being so tall and blonde and perfect), but no issues there.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,11.1999998093,"hype,way,wait,Williamsburg,bar,dining room,text,seats,seats,one,guy,dining companion,walk,seats,seats,everything,park,mix-up,disappointment,mix-up,fritters,seats,reason,cacio e pepe fritters,pasta,front,waiting list,couple,bar seats,malfadini,pepper,same,food,table settings,olive oil cake,hype,dollop,milk filling,top.,cream,pitfalls,waitstaff,lots,lots,issues,issues,trek,Lilia,customers,expectations,sauce,ravioli-type pastas,sheep,sheep,dish,milk agnolotti,flavors","7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,4,7,7,7,2,4,7,4,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.101368822157,0.0888612568378,0.0533502101898,0.0528963655233,0.0485579781234,0.0425204634666,0.0420474112034,0.0417037084699,0.0312405247241,0.0311597567052,0.0276492759585,0.0276492759585,0.0190229974687,0.0164156202227,0.0163777880371,0.0161966774613,0.0161378160119,0.0153377689421,0.0150255504996,0.0148292900994,0.0124548273161,0.0122405961156,0.01180525776,0.0112994108349,0.0112825669348,0.0108681833372,0.0108681833372,0.0108431139961,0.010568831116,0.0105334157124,0.0102409170941,0.0099036693573,0.00988692976534,0.0096747642383,0.00875913072377,0.0083763031289,0.00781504344195,0.00734208943322,0.00733519671485,0.00733519671485,0.00732878595591,0.00637156981975,0.00579994358122,0.00579994358122,0.00579520035535,0.00578655395657,0.0056926375255,0.00518612144515,0.005074350629,0.005074350629,0.00384609331377,0.0036848236341,0.0036848236341,0.00368108507246,0.00323116243817,0.00322369975038,0.00295667094178"

Minimal Nordic aesthetics as my friend describes - or in laymens terms, an upscale ikea. Soaring ceilings, neutral tones, everything sets you up for an elegant but Brooklyn-cool meal. For a table of 4, we shared 4 small plates, 4 pastas, and 2 desserts. Portions are smallish (we also love to eat). Cacio e pepe fritelle: fritters that seem basic but are so much more. Great starter- you can't really go wrong with fried dough. Cauliflower: so many flavors, so delicious, perfect. Grilled ramps: ramps are so trendy and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. This wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away. Grilled Scallops: I love scallops, and this was an interesting preparation with yogurt and walnuts. I wish the flavors had a bigger punch. Blowfish tails: sounded good but didn't turn out to be what I imagined. The fish were had lots of bones and the accompanying gremolata fell flat. Rigatoni: a comforting classic with a bit of heat. Malfadini: my favorite dish! I love the shape of the pasta. It's simple, satisfying, and I just don't know how it can be so good with such minimal ingredients. Agnolotti: cheese-filled pillows, delicate fragrant sauce. It's what dreams are made of.Pappardelle: another classic, but I wasn't as impressed with this.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,65510,"This restaurant is dangerous - I licked every plate clean. Housed in a former auto body shop, Lilia's is dishing out fresh pastas and lots of seafood dishes although there is meat in the pasta dishes and a couple of meat entrees too. Anyway on to the goodies. There's a starter called Bagna Cauda, which is basically a plate of vegetables served with a contraption with a flame beneath a cup holding a warm anchovy and garlic sauce for dipping. It is excellent. Another great starter is the grilled scallops with walnuts, yogurt, and marjoram which adds a nice sweet unfamiliar but welcomed flavor.We ordered two pasta dishes - one which was a special with bottarga and the other which is from the menu - Pappardelle, Veal Bolognese, Porcini, NutmegBoth were excellent. I'm not sure if my minimal consumption of starches makes me appreciate carbs when I do eat them, but the pastas were light and tasty. By the way, anything with bottarga is a must-have in my book. We also got the Black Bass entree with Salsa Verde and Coal Roasted Potatoes. The dish looked strange. The fish was covered in the salsa verde I couldn't see the fish and actually forgot what I ordered. The presentation was off-putting so I didn't take a picture but after digging into it, I was floored. What a delicate piece of fish, firm yet light. The potato was round and flat almost like a disc at the bottom of the dish. Usually I stop eating potatoes that are not sweet potatoes after a few bites but I could not stop eating this. I knew for sure this place is a keeper. I'm already planning my next visit. By the way the desserts are ok. I tried the olive oil cake and the chocolate flourless cake. I know Pete Wells and many others recommend the olive oil cake. I appreciate all foods and will try anything but my heart for sweets still belongs to chocolate and I preferred the chocolate over the olive oil cake. The olive oil cake was a little too subtle to satisfy any sweet tooth craving. Even the accompaniment of figs didn't help.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10025,"MAKE A RESERVATION! While you still can...This place has been opened for a little over a month and the secret is out. My brother and I came here last night for dinner. And we were literally turned away. But you can't get rid of us that easy. My brother felt determined. We were like ""what would it take to get a table?"". Finally the hostess made us a deal that we couldn't refuse. We would get a table but had to give up the table at 7:45pm.The space is beautiful, modern and warm. It was entirely buzzing with happy customers. We got seated close the kitchen which I loved. Being from Seattle I enjoy seeing my food being made and seeing the care and passion that goes into it. And trust me there is a lot of passion going into this food.We order a mezzo liter of Nebbiolo which is around 3 and 1/2 glasses. The glass itself was like a little snifter. The aromas shot up straight to my head and I was dizzy in delight. This is what wine should taste, smell and feel like. The taste of the good life.Everything on the menu was tempting. My brother and I picked a couple sharing starters and our own entrees. Since we are related we seem to have very similar palates. We ordered the grilled scallops with walnuts, yogurt and marjoram and the grilled squid with preserved Corbari tomatoes and fennel pollen. Corbari tomatoes are known to be the best in the world. They only grow in Corbara, Italy and it is speculated that the salty sea, volcano soil and sun contribute to it's flavor. These tomatoes were incredible and made you forget the NY winter.The seafood was perfect. And when I say the scallops and squid came perfectly cooked this is no exaggeration. It is so easy to over cook both of these and the scallops melted in my mouth and the squid was so tender. The portions were very modest. The only good thing about that was there is more room to try different dishes.We were going to order just one entree and the waitress suggested we have two. The bolognese looked substantial and my brother actually had a leftovers box. My ricotta gnocchi with pesto was just the right amount. My brother was blown away on how even the pesto wasn't too salty and tasted so fresh. They do not have bread service here.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198573,"I don't write many reviews but after my 3rd and final visit to Lilia, I felt compelled to. The food at Lilia is pretty damn good, as everyone has read, however the experience is not one that I have the desire to repeat. I've eaten a lot of the items off the menu, never had anything bad. I had the Spaghetti with lemon and parmigiano last night, which is definitely the weakest of all the dishes I've had. I love the rigatoni most out of the pastas. I don't think the ground lamb sausage goes very well with fettuccine. The lamb is great but eating ground sausage with that kind of pasta tends to leave you eating the pasta and then having a bowl of sausage at the end. It would go better with a pasta that the sausage would stick to. I enjoyed the olives and clams, but the best thing I've eaten at Lilia is the ramp focaccia that was just a seasonal thing but it was really exceptional. Onto the not so service...I understand that this place has gotten great reviews causing a lot of hype. Getting a reservation is strange because they really don't put many online at all. I've had to go in every time to get one (or call). Overall, this wait staff is probably my least favorite I've encountered in as long as I can remember. They consistently carry themselves as if they're doing you a favor by letting you eat at their restaurant. I take great pride in being respectful at restaurants because I truly do respect everything that goes into the food we eat. I have never felt that reciprocated from the staff at Lilia.One example of this is when I was told that I had to place my entire order at once and wasn't allowed to order any additional items once the ticket went into the kitchen. I've never been told this in my life....If I enjoy the pasta you made so much, I can't order more of it after I finish? That's completely bizarre and I can't image is the actual policy of the restaurant. It would seem more likely that a waitress perhaps didn't think my girlfriend and I would run up a big bill, because we look younger, and wanted to turn the table.Another example was my waiter last night. Four of us ordered, one member of the party decided to order two appetizers as an entree, the mushrooms and scallops. My friend ordered the chicken and my girlfriend and I ordered pasta. The waiter mentioned, aggressively, that the scallops were small and my friends girlfriend said she is ok with that. Then the waiter said that Lilia is a restaurant where people are meant to share things, which is something I have never been told at Lilia. He went on to say he would like to send out the two appetizers along with the olives and clams we ordered, first - then follow with the two pastas and chicken to share. When we expressed that wasn't what we wanted initially he pushed back rather aggressively.  Basically, he wanted to decide not only how we eat, but what we eat. I think it's pretty common knowledge that if customers wants to share dishes, they can do so. That's not what we wanted to do. None of us are vegetarians but he doesn't know that, maybe that's why we don't want to share the chicken? Perhaps someone is lactose intolerant?He mentioned the scallops being small at least 2 more times. When My girlfriend and I asserted that we want the food the way we ordered, the waiter got an attitude that I found to be totally unacceptable. We were then ignored for the rest of our meal, outside of one drink refill that I had to initiate. Outside of being ignored, we all felt that this waiter was treating us as if we didn't belong there from the second we sat down. I think Lilia makes good food and you should go ahead and try it if you're curious. My suggestion would be to try the bar to avoid their waiters, if you must go. For me however, I will never be entering those doors again. There are far too many restaurants in this city that I have experienced wonderful service and eaten fantastic food in, to waste time on a place that employs a staff that can ruin a good plate of pasta for me....which I didn't think was possible.I'll be going to Sauce or Babbo next time.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,17.3999996185,"Lilia,Spaghetti,ramp focaccia,reviews,girlfriend,ground lamb sausage,visit,waiter,food,pastas,pasta,policy,experience,waiter,Lilia.One,everything,everyone,items,lot,dishes,restaurant,things,rigatoni,desire,menu,anything,parmigiano,lemon,girlfriend,restaurants,appetizers,pasta,someone,pasta,place,lamb,sausage,sausage,drink refill,clams,reviews,lot,service,place,waitress,olives,pasta,waiter,wait staff,restaurant,restaurants,restaurant,fettuccine,pasta,end,bowl,kind,hype,reservation,food,favorite,something,ticket,attitude,staff,example,pride,scallops,chicken,favor,example,items,more,friend,friends,rest,call,kitchen,order,life,chicken,food,times,mushrooms,entree,party,people,member,ground sausage,bar,food,waiters,pasta,scallops,way,meal,second,service,staff,suggestion,food,bill,scallops,pastas,doors,plate,city,vegetarians,dishes,chicken,clams,olives,knowledge,customers,None,Sauce,Babbo","1,7,7,5,1,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,6,1,1,2,2,2,7,7,4,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,1,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,2","0.108919613063,0.106063455343,0.0822567716241,0.0395690836012,0.0326759591699,0.0237601604313,0.0234529245645,0.0210376512259,0.0196224749088,0.0181047786027,0.0175054967403,0.0143810361624,0.0136771397665,0.0135963214561,0.013577026315,0.0130572710186,0.012764910236,0.0126996133476,0.0126996133476,0.0126534858719,0.012195543386,0.0115133496001,0.0114695718512,0.0111711267382,0.0111139593646,0.0111139593646,0.0110735753551,0.0110735753551,0.0099977273494,0.00946371536702,0.00797794014215,0.00689202267677,0.00678685866296,0.00671960879117,0.00663598207757,0.00587787898257,0.00567886047065,0.00566925993189,0.00484460080042,0.0047839093022,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477752555162,0.00477280886844,0.00472366111353,0.00454327464104,0.00447973422706,0.00432876264676,0.0042459401302,0.00424222880974,0.00423243595287,0.00420712446794,0.00419930554926,0.00419891206548,0.00419891206548,0.00419891206548,0.00417997082695,0.00417492398992,0.0040320912376,0.00398742733523,0.00362253934145,0.00361431972124,0.00357530592009,0.00352480495349,0.00349580752663,0.00326838996261,0.00321635324508,0.00321436417289,0.00321133877151,0.00320590659976,0.00320590659976,0.00320344325155,0.00292353169061,0.0029218075797,0.00287240254693,0.00281503563747,0.00280478573404,0.00280478573404,0.00280263042077,0.00274940021336,0.00273117190227,0.0025729064364,0.00255930167623,0.00255930167623,0.00255930167623,0.00255476962775,0.00243272050284,0.00242881756276,0.00218247645535,0.00216891081072,0.00215787207708,0.00215635192581,0.00210569472983,0.00190121261403,0.00190044718329,0.00189970561769,0.00172574282624,0.00165038381238,0.00160973297898,0.00146538205445,0.00141098932363,0.00139100139495,0.00137341930531,0.00131358671933,0.00131313025486,0.00131313025486,0.00126801093575,0.00109747250099,0.00105111068115,0.000955960247666,0.000955960247666,0.000835043378174,0.000824516639113,0.000783009687439,0.000777130015194,0.000777130015194"

In particular the sopresada addition was just right- Slow Roasted Tomatoes - not much can be said about this other than they were outstanding- Grilled Scallops--cooked quite rare/too perfection!- Agnolotti - not what I would typically go for, but incredible- Grilled Lamb Steak - I can't remember ever having anything so lamby- Crispy shimp - our group also very much enjoyed this dishAs for dessert, the crostini...or was it a crostada...was outstanding.  The soft serve ice creams not as good.Overall, the pasta dishes definitely skewed towards northern Italian, I believe, and they were all great.Wine list was nice and reasonably priced, but NYC standards at least, and the food was a decent value too.An all around great experience.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.699999988079,3.5,"restaurant,wine list,plenty,Lilia,Lon Z.,execution,meat options,menu,Highlights,group,Scallops,restaurant,wine list,rest,rest,price,caliber,dessert,food,dishes,waiter,service,sopresada addition,all,nothing,things,top,themI,all.,assessment,dishAs,aperitifs,Tomatoes,crostada,dessert,crostini,stars,shimp,anything,ice creams,pasta dishes,Wine list,food,standards,Cauliflower,value,experience,perfection,Italian,NYC,too.An,Lamb Steak","2,7,7,1,1,4,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,6","0.125733196735,0.12345521152,0.106261849403,0.0554238222539,0.0434539094567,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0273735206574,0.0220143962651,0.0189225263894,0.0175862442702,0.0151888653636,0.0151888653636,0.0140056591481,0.0140056591481,0.0129077862948,0.011825511232,0.0116476574913,0.0112968292087,0.0107580414042,0.010249231942,0.00984625052661,0.00946309417486,0.00946309417486,0.00946309417486,0.00918574631214,0.00861644931138,0.00861644931138,0.00856597721577,0.0082331718877,0.00795719586313,0.00781167065725,0.00733245629817,0.00724019296467,0.00672329263762,0.00641605397686,0.00641605397686,0.00638218969107,0.00599190220237,0.00556730851531,0.00556730851531,0.00529073737562,0.00503950379789,0.00472052115947,0.00443069683388,0.00281523261219,0.00262314919382,0.00262314919382,0.00262314919382,0.00166641722899"

Missy really ensures quality and consistently!our first time here, we had the artichoke, which is a must try if you haven't had it before. we also had the smelts, which were so good, not fishy at all - but i believe it was seasonal. we LOVE the grilled clams, with Calabrian chili and topped with breadcrumbs! adds the perfect texture, we always devour the dish in seconds. i always order the malfadini, with pink peppercorn, it's my obsession! yes, very simple but just perfectly made - has never disappointed. my boyfriend always orders the sheeps milk cheesed filled agnolotti, he loves the balance between the sweet (from the honey) and savoury (from the cheese). i think it's lovely too, but i always stick with my malfadini.the prices are very reasonable and we are always satisfied with our meal while not breaking the bank. highly recommend and if you can, make reservations (they open up a month in advance). we've been here at least 3x i think, but it's one of our favorites.",5.0 star rating,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2,1,0.600000023842,8.39999961853,"expectations,more,artichoke,Lilia,times,reservation,cafe,opening,obsession,bar,boyfriend,reservations,one,time,walk-ins,quality,spots,smelts,malfadini,clams,Missy,chili,breadcrumbs,texture,dish,peppercorn,meal,bank,prices,Calabrian,advance,favorites,balance,agnolotti,sweet,honey,savoury,cheese,sheeps milk","7,7,7,1,7,7,2,4,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.101787500083,0.101787500083,0.0673541277647,0.0655227154493,0.0613022334874,0.0558192953467,0.0489049889147,0.0489049889147,0.0482845306396,0.0473342053592,0.0349126122892,0.0317091904581,0.0249348524958,0.0233600214124,0.0186720341444,0.0186042729765,0.0175285823643,0.013836203143,0.013031960465,0.0129900779575,0.0126742757857,0.0125062046573,0.0125062046573,0.0124818328768,0.0124818328768,0.0114043289796,0.00848876871169,0.00848876871169,0.00796783715487,0.00740862777457,0.00587221514434,0.00586626166478,0.00387383927591,0.00372926332057,0.00372926332057,0.00372926332057,0.00372926332057,0.00372926332057,0.00275079254061"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10400,"Technically, my rating is a 3.8/5 though I'm rounding up to 4 because overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience with above average food. Here's why: Ambiance (5/5). The space is nice and intimate. It's perfect for a date or even a birthday. That said, reservations are tough to get, so plan accordingly. I was lucky enough to score a same day resy due to a last minute cancellation, but reservations are typically booked a month in advance. Food (3.5/5). Like I said, the food was above average, but for the price, we were expecting more. +The cacio e pepe fritters (which come 3 to an order) were disappointing. 2 of the 3 fritters were overcooked, leaving us with doughy fried balls. I know this wasn't the intention because the third fritter was divine, oozing with cheesy cacio e pepe-flavored goodness. I just wish all 3 of the fritters were cooked this way because that one ball (which my GF and I shared) was the highlight of our meal. + the artichoke appetizer was great. It's hard to go wrong with veggies smothered in cheese and bread crumbs. Yum. I would order this again. + For mains, we shared the sheep's milk agnolotti and the mafaldani. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and for the most part, the flavor was on point (side note: if you're not a fan of pepper, I would pass on the mafaldani, which is topped with a heavy helping of pink peppercorn). My biggest complaint was that the food became cold quickly, which made the pasta almost unpleasant to eat. The mafaldani was very light on sauce, so it just tasted dry and chewy as it got cold. + We shared the chocolate soft serve for dessert. The ice cream was served with hazelnuts, espresso, and candied lemon zest. It was a lovely flavor combination, though there were a few bites that were unbalanced. The lemon zest can be overpowering if you're not careful about the ratio of ingredients in each spoonful. Price (3/5): Lilia is a three dollar sign establishment, so it's certainly not a cheap meal. For two appetizers, two pastas, one dessert, two vodka sodas, and tip, our bill came out to $125. This wouldn't have bothered me if the food blew me away, but it didn't. Given all the hype around Lilia, I was surprised to experience the aforementioned issues (inconsistent cooking, cold food, etc.). These are all things that can be easily addressed, and if/when they are, I will gladly come back.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,8607,"Great new Italian restaurant. I was expecting Lilia to be overrated given the social media hype it's gotten recently, but it really did blow me away with creative and seasonal takes on Italian classics. Lilia's reservations fill up weeks in advance, but I went with a friend as a walk in at 6:15 and were seated outside immediately. The outdoor tables were lovely and next to a public piano that was played by local musicians throughout our meal. We began the meal with the fresh mozzarella on garlic bread with lemon - a refreshing summer treat with tart lemon and creamy mozzarella! We then got the summer beans which were covered in spices, breadcrumbs and parmesan. And then onto the pastas... we got the mafaldini and the agnolotti. The mafaldini is what the internet has been raving about and I agree with the craze - it has beautiful waves and pink peppercorns to a bring a unique color to the dish, and the pasta was perfectly al dente. However, the agnolotti stole the show - it had a savory honey lemon saffron sauce that was memorable and the deep tastes lingered for hours.The waitress recommended we order 1 or 2 more dishes than we did, but we were both pleased with the amount of food.

This is perhaps the best pasta dish I've ever had. Do not come here without ordering it. Do not live the rest of your life without putting this in your mouth.But really, you can't go wrong. We started with cocktails (the Bianco Bianco is all I want to drink in the summer, and the Milano Sour is no slouch), we continued with wine (the list is excellent), and we shared snacks (LOVE the Cauliflower Romanesco), and all the pasta.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198924,"I was super excited about my dinner at Lilia, in part because of the positive reviews in NY Mag and partly because I had to get a reservation a full month out, so there was plenty of build-up.Long story short: The food was good for the most part, but nothing that blew my mind. But more importantly, we were made to wait an hour (until 9:30p, on a Monday) for our table EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A RESERVATION. An hour? Because our party of five couldn't be sat anywhere else than the table where people lingered forever and ever? I refuse to believe that was the only option! They comped us two orders of $7 cacio pepe fritelle, which were good, but a round of drinks would have done much more to repair the ill will.The pastas were pretty tasty--we had the rigatoni diavola (good), pasta with wild mushrooms and aged goat cheese (good but boring, and surprisingly oily), and sheep's milk agnolotti with saffron, tomato and honey (surprisingly awesome, in a sweet and savory way).The veal flank steak was tender and lean, but it tasted unpleasant, like pickled meat -- it was topped with an overwhelming amount of pickled hot peppers (the menu didn't indicate that they were pickled) and parsley instead of basil which is what the menu said and is a huge difference when there are only two flavors in the dish. The swordfish was the best dish on our table, light, very fresh tasting. I thought the scallops were a miss.

Finally, we made it to our table. We had to flag down our waiter to order wine and food bc he wasn't attentive at all. He also had a lackadaisical attitude that completely took away from the experience. After all this, finally, the food. We felt everything was over-salted and the only two things we'd recommend were the trumpet mushrooms starter and the agnolotti with saffron, tomato, and honey. Both were delicious but definitely not mind-blowing. We eat took a bite of the cacio e pepe fritelle and couldn't have more than that because of the salt. The broth the artichoke came with barely had any flavor. The gnocchi dish had a delicious pesto but the gnocchis themselves were chewy and the opposite of 'melt in your mouth.' The mezzaluna was nothing special and didn't have enough corn, the only thing that offset the saltiness of the dish which came from soo much cheese on top.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10943,"Wow, this place is great.. This is one of the more exciting and enjoyable meals I have had (outside of China) in a long time.. In fact, I can't think of another restaurant in Brooklyn that I would rather go to.  I would go back for lunch today and eat some of those things I had last night again.   We started with the Cacio e pepe fritlle which essentially was a beautiful gougeres covered in a beautiful pecorino.  They were perfectly made and the cheese was just so delicious.. Next up, this dish was outrageous, the bagna cauda.. what seemed to be a half share of a CSA was served with grilled bread and a delicious, anchovy filled warm bagna cauda kept heated over a candle..  The vegetables were delicious.. There was radicchio, baby potatoes, romesco, snap peas and radishes perfectly cooked and or subtly seasoned.. Some of them were a tad spicy with finely crushed pepper, other had a slight hint of lemon..  In fact, there seems to be some type of chile pepper in all of the dishes.. Whether it's flakes or flecks or ground, there a nice balanced heat..  It was just beautifully done.. Precious in a good way, i would say.. This is just fantastic. blow fish tails are just ok.. There is a monkfish quality to blow fish that just makes it a boring fish. They were cooked ok and the sauce was had a nice acid to it but, at the end of the day, it's just not an exciting fish. The clams are a stop everything and run to get this dish..  Pickled Calabrian chile peppers with butter and super fine toasted bread crumbs.. And the portion was large ta boot..  Really great. agnolotti with honey:  a beautiful plate of pasta. Little gem salad:  this was shockingly good.. It was a grown up version of the typical salad you would get at Italian American restaurant.. Except the vinegar was a strong and acidic. the oregano fresh and bright and there was no pile of water at the bottom of the bowl.. Same tiny crunch bread crumbs from the clams.  Love this salad. The last dish, which was a shame to end on was the Ricotta Gnocchi.. This was the only misstep of the entire night.. And it happened on two levels. We arrived last night as the kitchen was closing.. So, we placed our entire ordered at once.. After all the food was served our waitress asked us if we would like coffee or dessert. I asked about the Gnocchi.. She said hold on one moment and went back to the kitchen.. When she came back I said, we don't really need the dish.. I even kind of said, we would prefer not to have it as we were full.. She was graciously adamant.   Now, we all know that the kitchen closes at 11 and it was well passed that time.  So, the dish arrives and the gnocchi is rather hard..  I had heard it be described as pillowy and light.. this was anything but.. I was sad, it was dense and gummy.   The whole dish just didn't feel right.  Not on par with any of the other dishes we had and it makes me feel like it was slapped together. if i can say one thing, the flavors were there, the pistachios were delicious.   this place is a gem, the space is beautiful, staff is professional..

I preferred the Fettucine with Lamb Sausage. The meat and sauce gave the dish the stronger flavor I was looking for.At this point, we were both pretty stuffed, but you can't leave without trying dessert! We settled for the chocolate softserve.

That being said, the bartenders and front of house is fantastic, but the servers do dictate a bigger part of the dining experience. In any case, it's definitely worth trying to snag a table in advance since this place is perennially filled with people. Highly recommend any of the pastas, especially the lemony spaghetti with pine nuts, rigatoni diavola and the agnolotti which are these perfect pillows stuffed with ricotta and bathed in a velvety buttery sauce. I'm obsessed with the sardines on toast if that's your thing (it's not for everyone). The veggie appetizers are really flavorful as well.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3171,"Went to Lilia last month with a friend.  We had heard great things about the place and were excited to try it out.  Reservations are hard to get at typical dinnertime hours (6-9), but there is usually available before 6 and after 9:30 online.  I made a late reservation (9:30) but was lucky enough to get a table around 7pm by walking in.The restaurant is in a former auto shop, with very high ceilings and an open kitchen.  Seating is limited, and there is a bar with approximately 12-15 seats.  Waitstaff were pleasant and helpful.I tried the following dishes:Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms, Arugula, Balsamic, Sicilian Almonds (4/5): Tasty mushroom dish.  The mushrooms had a very savory taste and were not tough or rubbery.Mafaldini, Pink Peppercorns, Parmigiano Reggiano (3/5): I had very high hopes for this dish, as Lilia is known for it.  However, my dining partner and I both did not particularly enjoy it.  The pink peppercorn flavor was interesting and unique, but the pasta was very heavy, and the parmesan was incredibly thick and caked onto the pasta.  It was not a very subtle dish.Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey (5/5): Excellent agnolotti.  The sheeps milk was delicate and slightly sweet, and the agnolotti was cooked very well.  This was definitely my favorite dish.I did enjoy my dinner at Lilia, and I hope to return again to try some of the other dishes on the menu, as well as order the agnolotti again.",4.0 star rating,"Houston, TX",2,1,0.20000000298,5.30000019073,"Lilia,friend,Reservations,place,things,Dried Tomato,table,reservation,mushroom dish,Seating,dishes,mushrooms,dish,dining partner,bar,seats,ceilings,auto shop,restaurant,kitchen,Arugula,taste,sheeps milk,agnolotti,agnolotti,hopes,some,Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms,Milk Cheese,dish.,Honey,dishes,agnolotti,Pink Peppercorns,Sicilian Almonds,Balsamic,Mafaldini,Parmigiano Reggiano,dinner,menu,Waitstaff,parmesan,pasta,Saffron,peppercorn flavor,pasta","1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,3,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,4,7,1,6,7,1,7,6","0.132182583213,0.123097606003,0.0631721541286,0.0592341721058,0.0592341721058,0.0313111506402,0.0290302615613,0.0257645007223,0.0217582769692,0.0212584659457,0.0209490470588,0.0202473569661,0.019877742976,0.0194558575749,0.0186068546027,0.0173662509769,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0151635985821,0.0151340588927,0.0140437912196,0.0139334835112,0.0139166908339,0.0138514144346,0.0118188541383,0.0112872477621,0.010979690589,0.0108940619975,0.0103061422706,0.0102257551625,0.00962997879833,0.00937807746232,0.00898418482393,0.00898418482393,0.00896666012704,0.00820583850145,0.00803646631539,0.00712134735659,0.00657438579947,0.00618143333122,0.00618143333122,0.00610374798998,0.00540832616389,0.00517639936879"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3506,"Thank you, Lilia, for restoring my faith in the art of food. Because that's what Lilia is serving -- art. Well-crafted, thoughtful, complex, and ridiculously delicious art.My friend and I arrived for 6:30 reservations on a weeknight (you'll need to make them a couple weeks in advance) and were seated immediately. The vibe of the restaurant itself is awesome, and a bit non-Williamsburg-esque. It was something like a blend of rustic and industrial style with an upscale edge. And I love that they cleared our plates and silverware between courses; that is incredibly underrated. Now, onto the food! We ordered:Grilled rampsGrilled squid Baked clamsSheep's milk agnolottiMalfadini Olive oil cakePlenty of wineThe ramps were light and flavorful -- if you've never had them (think sort of a subtle scallion) you should.The squid and clams were delicious. I think the squid was my favorite of the two -- the squid itself was perfectly cooked, and the preserved colabri tomato and fennel pollen (I still don't know what that means but I want more) took it to a whole new level. Now, for the famous pastas. The malfadini lived up to the hype. It was so *different* and yet so comforting. But my friend and I agreed the sheep's milk agnolotti was the star of the night. The pasta was beautifully cooked and the sheep's milk cheese... My god. So luscious. And so addictive. Just order it. After such an incredible meal I will say I was disappointed by the olive oil cake dessert. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Mario Batali's cake, but this was just too dense and dry.

For a table of 2 on Saturday night they said we would have to wait 1.5-2 hrs but it only ended up being about 40 minutes. They have a small bar in the back that you can get small snacks or drinks. You can sit inside or outside at a few tables while you wait. Inside seating for dinner can be at the bar or a table and there is also outside seating. Across from the front door is a larger area to sit (I think it's actually part of the neighborhood) and there is a piano which was fun to sit down and play with while we waited. The wine was true Italian wines and delicious. We got the summer squash which was a little salty but still pretty good. The cucumbers with feta was also good but a bit spicy. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and I got the mezzaluna. I wish there was a little more food on my plate because I got about 10 pasta shells but it was very good.

Had to settle for a 10:45PM reservation because the advance booking was full. My husband and I were looking forward to it because of the hype, publicity and proximity to home. We arrived 10mins early and were led to the back cafe for a drink and/or snack while we waited. The waiting cafe was fine, had to wait a while for our drink bc the place was busy. Small space, but thankful for any proper waiting space in this town.Only waited for about 15mins before we were sat. We were told the (Italian) restaurant was out of BREAD and a couple of other things from the specials list. It was late, but that was the only time we could book. The waiter was nice enough, I could tell we were one of his last tables and he was perfectly professional and patient. The service was lovely (the red-headed hostess was really sweet) but the food was just fine. Just ok. Had the Fra Diavolo pasta and my husband had the lamb pasta. It was fine.

My brother and I came here last night for dinner. And we were literally turned away. But you can't get rid of us that easy. My brother felt determined. We were like ""what would it take to get a table?"". Finally the hostess made us a deal that we couldn't refuse. We would get a table but had to give up the table at 7:45pm.The space is beautiful, modern and warm. It was entirely buzzing with happy customers. We got seated close the kitchen which I loved. Being from Seattle I enjoy seeing my food being made and seeing the care and passion that goes into it. And trust me there is a lot of passion going into this food.We order a mezzo liter of Nebbiolo which is around 3 and 1/2 glasses. The glass itself was like a little snifter. The aromas shot up straight to my head and I was dizzy in delight. This is what wine should taste, smell and feel like. The taste of the good life.Everything on the menu was tempting. My brother and I picked a couple sharing starters and our own entrees. Since we are related we seem to have very similar palates. We ordered the grilled scallops with walnuts, yogurt and marjoram and the grilled squid with preserved Corbari tomatoes and fennel pollen. Corbari tomatoes are known to be the best in the world. They only grow in Corbara, Italy and it is speculated that the salty sea, volcano soil and sun contribute to it's flavor. These tomatoes were incredible and made you forget the NY winter.The seafood was perfect. And when I say the scallops and squid came perfectly cooked this is no exaggeration. It is so easy to over cook both of these and the scallops melted in my mouth and the squid was so tender. The portions were very modest. The only good thing about that was there is more room to try different dishes.We were going to order just one entree and the waitress suggested we have two. The bolognese looked substantial and my brother actually had a leftovers box. My ricotta gnocchi with pesto was just the right amount. My brother was blown away on how even the pesto wasn't too salty and tasted so fresh. They do not have bread service here. I would have loved to pick up the sauce with a little crusty corner however I will not hold my breath. Unfortunately our time ran to an end before we could get dessert. And trust me when I say I will be back and I will be getting the olive oil cake. You can quote me on that.This is the experience you get from the Michelin star chef, Missy Robbins.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198661,"Dinner with friends at this new spot, in Wiliamsburg, where chef Missy Robbins is serving up creative Italian comfort food in her own digs (we last saw her on these pages as the chef at A Voce Madison years ago. I'm not going to review everything we ate - it was all delicious, some more than others, so I'm picking and choosing, but over the course of the meal we had eleven different plates on the table. We started with excellent garlic focaccia, and also some tasty little ""doughnuts"" or fritelle dusted with cheese and pepper.On to a trio of dishes from her ""small fishes"" selection - standouts were the Calabrian chili spiked clams and the coriander crusted blowfish tails. Good, but a little heavy feeling, the scallops in yogurt and walnuts.Her specialty is still pastas, and these corzetti with chilies and aspargus didn't disappoint. Neither did the lamb fettucine, nor the tortelli. And one non-pasta main course, the roast chicken with lemon and fingerling potatoes was just as good.We finished up with a strawberry crostata (tasty, if a bit too sweet for my tastes, and I still had that rhubarb one in mind from the night before), and the dessert menu features various iterations of soft serve gelato, we went with chocolate and hazelnut, which was just one of those happy making dishes.Overall, delicious food, tending towards a little heavy on salt on many of the dishes (same thing that used to be an issue at A Voce), great new digs, and the place was jammed to capacity with people waiting all evening long, on a Monday night, and several blocks off the main drag of Williamsburg.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3541,"I would like to start this review by saying, if this was based on the food alone, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars. Our server's attitude and pushy behavior is what brought my rating down to 4 stars.The first time my husband and I came here, we came on a Saturday night at 6PM (which we thought was pretty early) after a yoga class around the corner. We did not have a reservation, but there were 2 of us and we thought it was early. Worse comes to worse, we thought we could wait at the bar. When we entered, the place was packed. The host told us that there were no tables available for the whole night and counter service had a wait of 2 hours. What!? So we left and made a reservation as soon as we got home. This is one of those restaurants that is not on OpenTable but is on Resy, which I hate. Resy does not benefit the customer in any way what so ever, where as OpenTable gives you points for every reservation that can go towards a gift certificate that can be used at restaurants. I wish Lilia would reconsider and put themselves on OpenTable. We made our reservation for a month and a half away from the date when we tried to get in because that was the soonest one available! On our second try, we were seated right away. Lesson learned: always make a reservation!When we were seated, we were handed menus and drink menus. Neither my husband and I were in the mood for an alcoholic beverage so we just asked for tap water. Our server then replied with, ""Are you sure? No wine or beer or a cocktail?"" We said no. His displeasure was palpable. He then went on to ask (with obvious annoyance and attitude), ""Soda or anything else?"" We said we were going to stick with water. He actually HUFFED and walked away briskly. Meanwhile, the server who filled our waters and continually refilled our waters could not have been more lovely. He was chatty, funny, and just sweet. Great service from him.Once we settled on what we wanted to order, we waited patiently for the server to come back and take our order. We had to wait 20 minutes for him to come back. It was obvious that because we did not order booze to increase our bill ( and therefore his tip), we were not his priority. He finally came back and told us the specials, most of which included truffles. My husband asked about the fondue appetizer special with the truffles but it was $45, which was more than any entree and a smaller portion. Truffles are expensive, we get it. No complaint about the price there, but at the same time not what we wanted to spend our money on. We instead ordered the burrata appetizer on garlic bread to share.  Our server languidly asked us if we wanted to get another appetizer because they are ""very small."" We said no and he audibly sighed. We ordered the famous Mafaldini and the Agnolotti with saffron. The server asked, ""Are you sure you don't want anything else?"" We said no, again, and he left. I have honestly never experienced such rudeness from a server.The burrata was absolutely amazing. Fresh delicious burrata topped amazing garlic bread with small sprinkles of lemon rind on top. Really delicious. Such a burst of flavor. The Mafaldini lives up to hype. It was a fresh take on the traditional cacio e Pepe with pink peppercorns. The peppercorns complemented the cheese and the pasta beautifully. The Angnolotti a MUST when you come here. The flavors in this dish are just outstanding. The subtle nuttiness of the cheese pairs perfectly with the burst of flavor from the saffron in the sauce. Absolutely stunning. I could have eaten 3 more bowls of each of these dishes.The desserts just didn't appeal to us so we skipped them, which angered our server to no end. God he was just so rude. The food here is unreal. I would absolutely come back for the food, but this server needs to check his attitude next time he comes to work. It was obvious we made him angry because we didn't have a big enough bill in his eyes. I understand everyone has an off day and everyone is entitled to that but this really put a damper on our evening. It did not need to happen. As an adult and someone who works in the service industry you need to realize when you are going to far and being rude and change your attitude around.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,967,"Pros: delicious, fresh pastas.Cons: not-so-delicious, very fresh (attitude) hostess.Here's what happened with the blonde hostess on two occasions now:We walk inside, wait in line to ask about a table, hostess DOES NOT greet us with a smile or even say hello. I worked FOH in restaurants in Manhattan for two years and can tell you if she worked with any of my former managers there would be some serious discussions about the attitude issues. Being snotty to guests is not ""in""-- not even in scene-y Williamsburg. I've experienced warmer hospitality at the IHOP.She must think she's working the velvet rope at Bagatelle. Honey, you're at an Italian restaurant in Williamsburg at 6pm on a Monday. Take a chill pill.We politely inquire about seating and make it clear we'll be flexible re: bar vs dining room. She abruptly retorts the same regurgitated canned response I overheard her say to the party in front of us: the dining room fully booked out three days ago, and the wait for dinner at the bar is 1.5 to 1.75 hours. *looks around, sees 10 open tables*Lol. Fine. But there's a more hospitable way to tell someone there's almost a two hour wait early on a Monday night.My friend and I recommend Lilia modify their policy so that you can only reserve a table in the dining room and the bar should be fully first come first serve only. Any other way seriously deters patrons. I don't know many people willing to wait almost 2 hours early on a Monday. It's right after work and we're starving.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3506,"Thank you, Lilia, for restoring my faith in the art of food. Because that's what Lilia is serving -- art. Well-crafted, thoughtful, complex, and ridiculously delicious art.My friend and I arrived for 6:30 reservations on a weeknight (you'll need to make them a couple weeks in advance) and were seated immediately. The vibe of the restaurant itself is awesome, and a bit non-Williamsburg-esque. It was something like a blend of rustic and industrial style with an upscale edge. And I love that they cleared our plates and silverware between courses; that is incredibly underrated. Now, onto the food! We ordered:Grilled rampsGrilled squid Baked clamsSheep's milk agnolottiMalfadini Olive oil cakePlenty of wineThe ramps were light and flavorful -- if you've never had them (think sort of a subtle scallion) you should.The squid and clams were delicious. I think the squid was my favorite of the two -- the squid itself was perfectly cooked, and the preserved colabri tomato and fennel pollen (I still don't know what that means but I want more) took it to a whole new level. Now, for the famous pastas. The malfadini lived up to the hype. It was so *different* and yet so comforting. But my friend and I agreed the sheep's milk agnolotti was the star of the night. The pasta was beautifully cooked and the sheep's milk cheese... My god. So luscious. And so addictive. Just order it. After such an incredible meal I will say I was disappointed by the olive oil cake dessert. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Mario Batali's cake, but this was just too dense and dry.

This was a very bright and satisfying way to begin the meal.  The Cacio e pepe fritelle was also delicious, and for a fried snack, it was surprisingly light and fluffy, yet packed with big flavors.  For our entrees, we had the sheep's milk agnolotti and the mafaldini.  The sheep's milk agnolotti had to be one of the most delicious pasta dishes I've ever had.  The sheepiness, for lack of a better word, provided a lovely richness which was balanced by just a touch of sweet honey. This was really well done.  The mafaldini was simple and delicious, reminiscent of a cacio e pepe with a strong, pink peppercorn flavor and the interesting pasta.

Was told that all the tables were fully committed but the bar and outside seating were wait list or first come first serve. And was told to speak directly to the bartender. Arrived to two open seats and engaged the bar tender who even rearranged the seats so we had more room. Was handed two menus and a wine list. Proceeded to order a bottle of wine and was then approached by a very unprofessional server. She proceeded to ask if we were on the waiting list and I explained the above at which point we were asked to get up.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,160871,"We visited Lilia tonight, just a little bit more than a week after opening. The restaurant is good, but certainly has room to improve as it fine tunes over its first few weeks. The prices are high enough to make this restaurant somewhere for special occasions. While any given dish isn't expensive, the portion size is small -- so you may need to end up ordering several dishes to make a full meal. Our meal ran about $60 per person with tip and a bit of wine.The menu is divided into several categories -- cocktail snacks, veggies, small fish, big fish, pasta and large entrees. There is a nice, but not large, wine list that runs around $12 per glass and starts at around $40 per bottle. My fiance and I opted for an order of bread and mozzarella (a cocktail snack), an order of grilled clams with bread crumbs (small fish) and an order of the ricotta gnocchi with broccoli pesto (pasta).The bread and mozzarella was a bit small for the price -- working out to three slices of bread with a slice of cheese on each. Maybe this was just an example of misplaced expectation, but I was hoping for a large ball of mozz. Overall, this dish had a nice flavor, but was hoping for something a bit more substantial.The clams also had an excellent taste. Unfortunately, they were as chewy as rubber. I'm not sure if this has to do with (a) cooking clams on a wood grill, (b) the lack of fresh delivery on the first day after the blizzard, or (c) bad sourcing. Whatever the reason, they left something to be desired at least in terms of texture.Finally, the gnocchi with broccoli pesto was awesome! We gobbled it up. It wasn't a large portion, but still ran almost $20.For dessert, we ordered an apple pastry with a scoop of gelato. This was an amazing dish, but note that if you ask for a scoop of gelato that will run another $8.Service was attentive, but maybe a bit awkward. With time, I'm sure the wait staff will feel a bit more comfortable and in command of the table.",4.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",2,1,0.10000000149,8.19999980927,"room,opening,Lilia,restaurant,example,prices,clams,tunes,somewhere,occasions,restaurant,meal,wine list,dish,bit,dishes,portion size,cocktail snacks,bread,categories,veggies,menu,tip,person,bit,scoop,bread,bread,meal,dish,fish,fish,pasta,pasta,mozzarella,order,order,mozzarella,order,fish,mozz,ricotta gnocchi,broccoli pesto,cocktail snack,price,slices,slice,something,entrees,glass,bottle,bread crumbs,fiance,each,cheese,gnocchi,expectation,ball,flavor,taste,apple pastry,portion,broccoli pesto,gelato,scoop,something,terms,texture.,dessert,dish,gelato,table,wait staff,command,cooking clams,rubber,sourcing,blizzard,delivery,lack,wood grill,reason,Service","2,4,1,2,7,7,7,5,2,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,6,7,7","0.11789458245,0.0570119731128,0.0441878251731,0.0381043478847,0.0294223781675,0.0291105043143,0.0290367733687,0.0272868070751,0.0271477773786,0.0271477773786,0.0240970868617,0.0233460944146,0.0216664839536,0.0171371456236,0.0155927715823,0.0139999305829,0.0126812821254,0.0118020363152,0.0112118776888,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.00957116764039,0.0094825103879,0.00939152389765,0.00939152389765,0.00918904878199,0.00912766810507,0.00876375380903,0.00876375380903,0.00876375380903,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.00797288026661,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00724153826013,0.00697558745742,0.00695949746296,0.00695949746296,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00643784599379,0.00634581502527,0.00634581502527,0.00633635371923,0.00633635371923,0.00591587740928,0.00573290651664,0.00539149949327,0.00538097880781,0.00538097880781,0.00474980054423,0.00471728062257,0.00471728062257,0.00470807403326,0.0046934527345,0.00372270517983,0.00325433001854,0.00325433001854,0.00325433001854,0.00260331947356,0.002073954558,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.002069164766,0.00164217909332"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,50514,"Been dying to try this restaurant after all the hype! Finally snagged a reservation for a late dinner on Sunday night at 9:30.I am obsessed with the venue and the ambiance of the hotel. The lighting was cozy and it was quiet enough for good conversation. Our service was also great and our waitress provided us with good recommendations based on the types of food we wanted to eat. Sadly, the clams were out by the time we arrived, but she was able to give us a great alternative.We each ordered a glass of wine as well as the artichoke to start with. Although messy to eat, the artichoke was pretty tasty, but I would probably order something else to start with the next time I come. The cauliflower looked good as well as the mushrooms.Per our waitress' recommendation after we found out the clams were no longer, we ordered the crispy little fish which were very very good to begin with. After waiting a bit, our pastas came out!! The highlight of the meal! We ordered the famously photographed peppercorn Malfadini, which was simple yet so delicious. Love the seasoning. To balance, we also got the pappardelle with the veal bolognese which was also very delicious. The pasta tasted fresh and overall, we had enough food for two people to split well.Only reason I'm detracting a star is because for the hefty price tag of the meal in the end...nothing was WOW or mindblowing.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,31202,"Extremely overhyped and overpriced is the best and nicest way that I can describe Lilia Caffe. It's been awhile since I've been disappointed in a restaurant - fault on my end as I should have known from the previous reviews warning of bad service and food being served warm. However, Lilia lured me in with people's constant pictures of the Mafaldini and agnolotti. Plus, it's a hassle in itself to lock down a reservation at a normal before 10:30 pm (you'll need to plan a month in advance), adding to the hype. Trust me, Lilia is aware of its social standing as my first encounter with an employee was when I attempted to cancel an existing reservation - the hostess was extremely rude and thought it was attempting to make a reservation and said they were completely booked that day, have a nice day, and hung up immediately. Uh okay? I didn't let any of this bother me as I was still excited to try the 2 dishes mentioned above, along with the cacio e pepe balls, which was also a popular item. Our cacio e pepe appetizer arrived warm, unlike the usual fried items that come piping hot. Flavor wise, we both agreed that we didn't taste anything but parmesan cheese - a bit disappointing there. Like the appetizer, both the mafaldini and the agnolotti arrived luke warm if at best - we both were shocked at how small the portion sizes were given a $19 price tag.. They both lacked in taste too that I can't really describe them. Service really lacks here. Upon ordering the 3 dishes our waiter gave us a look and rudely kept attempting to get us to order more; in the end he left shunning us as we denied his suggestion.

All the dishes were really good, but the two that stood out the most are the grilled clams and the rib eye steak. The steak is definitely pricey but it's well worth it and cooked perfectly. (Note: best dish I ever had here was the Black Truffle and homemade pasta dish back in January). I had lemon ice and vanilla gelato dessert which was pretty good as well. Drinks are made well: the Bianco Bianco and the Boulevardier were my favorites. The service was impeccable as well.  My only issue was parking; it took about 20 minutes to find a spot 2 blocks away which I narrowly made into since I have a smaller car.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199077,"Lilia. Oh. Oh my,While in NYC for meetings I decided to make a short pilgrimage to Williamsburg to see what all the to-do was about. Now I know. The magic of the once-otherworldly Spiaggia and Cafe Spiaggia in Chicago is back, only it's now a few miles east. In Brooklyn.The place is warm and welcoming, and very much has the feel of a casual neighborhood spot while still being just elegant enough. There is a huge open kitchen that runs almost the entire length of the restaurant, with a huge wood-burning grill at one end and an army of cooks along the line turning out amazing food. The whole operation is visible and it's a little hard to believe that this place just opened, because it seems to run like a well-tuned machine.I sat with a friend at the bar and got friendly and attentive service. The bartenders and servers were thoroughly versed in every item on the menu, and from the reactions when I asked about a few dishes, I got the sense that they were truly passionate about the food. This did not bode well for me restraining myself. Here we go: - Beverages: I got the obligatory Negroni and as expected it was perfect. With dinner I had a glass of Falanghina and later a Nebbiolo. The cocktail and wine lists seemed to have just the right number of options and prices were all reasonable. - Cacio e Pepe Fritelle (easy for you to say): In other words, cheese and pepper doughnut. This was one of those rare fried things that somehow manages to be as light as a popover. Savory, delicious.- Roasted trumpet mushrooms: this was when I started saying to myself things like ""Holy $&%# this is good"" and ""&@!*"" and such. I told myself I was going to sample a bunch of stuff, that wasn't going to finish everything I ordered, and failed right out of the gate.- Scallops: first item from the wood grill. Perfectly cooked, perfectly balanced prep. I didn't know whether to eat them or roll around in them.- Tuna was also perfectly grilled on the outside edges and beautifully deep red.- We also tried a couple of pasta dishes in between those last two. I'm a sucker for anything fra diavolo, and there it was on the menu staring at me. My friend ordered the gnocchi, which took me back to a great lunch I had years ago at a little seaside restaurant in Italy.- Dessert: some ridiculously good, buttery, apple tart kind of thing. More expletives.Like the wine, I thought everything on the menu was very reasonably priced. Add the quality and presentation of the food and it's an amazing value. The room was full and lively, the music was great and the light was dim, but not so dark that I needed a flashlight to read the menu like so many other places nowadays. (Admit it, you've done that too,)Lilia is the kind of place I could easily go to 2-3 times a week.

We ordered Prosciutto, Grilled Scallops, Rigatoni Diavola and Sheeps Milk Cheese filled Agnolotti, and the Apple Ginger Crostata.Scallops are one of those things that if I see it on a menu, I have to have it. I really enjoyed their version... Really lets the scallop speak for itself without overdoing any seasoningRigatoni wasn't very special for me. Pasta was cooked to perfection but I was hoping for an out of this world tomato sauce but it didn't do much for me. Agnolotti on the other hand was very rich anddelicious.

The staff was very attentive and there was excellent service, as expected at this kind of restaurant. What we ordered:Cacio e Pepe fritelle- good, light and airy, but I felt the sprinkled cheese on the outside was too salty or overpowering Cauliflower sopressata- very very good. Perfect for anyone who loves a bit of vinegar with cauliflower. Recommend Mafaldini- this was good and the portion was good. It was only warm not hot when it arrived and it got cold as I was eating. But the pasta texture itself was great Sheeps milk agnolotti- love love love. The flavor and texture of this made the magaldini almost seem plain in comparison. The honey and saffron and thyme worked beautifully together. The only ""issue"" I had was that the pasta was not hot/warm. The mafaldini was maybe room temperature and the agnolotti was maybe lightly warmer. But I would except the food to be warm and not barely room temperature because eventually eating cold was a lot less appetizing, especially for the mafaldini. For desserts, our waiter was so sweet. Since I made a note it was my mom's birthday, we originally ordered the apple ginger crostata and the olive oil cake, but we had asked about the chocolate torta. So the crostata and torta came out first and we thought there was a mistake but then the brought out the olive oil cake with a candle for her birthday and the torta was on the house!

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,20785,"Sometimes you just know it's going to be good before you get there. Lilia was great from beginning to end. It was exceedingly hard to secure a reservation on Resy, but I basically just booked the reservation a month ahead of time, and took care of the logistics of finding others later. The space and decor is very clean, modern, and austere, but has a very ""polished"" look, which I was a big fan of. What we got:- Cacio e pepe frittelle: Basically super cheesy, peppery fritters. These were unreal, and we probably could have polished off a few of these- Grilled clams with calabrian chili oil and bread crumbs: Yet another dish I could have eaten many orders of.- Cauliflower and romanesco with spicy soppressata, Sicilian pesto, and marjoram: We had to get our greens from somewhere, and this was perfect- Mafaldini with pink peppercorns and parmigiano reggiano: Best pasta of the night. Pink peppercorns added that little bit of spice, and the generous amount of parmigiano reggiano really made for a rich dish. As mentioned previously, I could have eaten a bucket of this stuff.- Sheep's milk cheese filled agnolotti, saffron, dried tomato, and honey: Really delicious, and the saffron taste really came through in the sauce- Goat cheese filled tortelli, ramps, lemon: Very tasty, and I really liked the citrus- Grilled veal flank steak with hot peppers and basil: So tender, so delicious.- Chocolate soft serve with chocolate stracci and salted hazelnuts: Pretty standard, but the salted hazelnuts really added a dimension to the ice cream that I liked- Olive oil cake with blood orange and fresh cream: Super tasty, although kind of randomly plated, as the cream was just sort of piled on. They were very generous with it though, so I'm not complaining too much.Service was very attentive with drinks and food, but surprisingly not very confident with recommendations. It's not that their recommendations were bad, but they just didn't seem too sure about what they were recommending. It was a little odd, but nonetheless, everything we got was great and end to end, our meal was pretty much flawless. Prices are decent, with each of the pastas at about $19-25, and the meats all under $30, except for the dry-aged ribeye special.Will definitely be back again, provided I can secure a reservation.

I'm not going to review everything we ate - it was all delicious, some more than others, so I'm picking and choosing, but over the course of the meal we had eleven different plates on the table. We started with excellent garlic focaccia, and also some tasty little ""doughnuts"" or fritelle dusted with cheese and pepper.On to a trio of dishes from her ""small fishes"" selection - standouts were the Calabrian chili spiked clams and the coriander crusted blowfish tails. Good, but a little heavy feeling, the scallops in yogurt and walnuts.Her specialty is still pastas, and these corzetti with chilies and aspargus didn't disappoint. Neither did the lamb fettucine, nor the tortelli. And one non-pasta main course, the roast chicken with lemon and fingerling potatoes was just as good.We finished up with a strawberry crostata (tasty, if a bit too sweet for my tastes, and I still had that rhubarb one in mind from the night before), and the dessert menu features various iterations of soft serve gelato, we went with chocolate and hazelnut, which was just one of those happy making dishes.Overall, delicious food, tending towards a little heavy on salt on many of the dishes (same thing that used to be an issue at A Voce), great new digs, and the place was jammed to capacity with people waiting all evening long, on a Monday night, and several blocks off the main drag of Williamsburg.

The clams, cacio pepe fritelle, mafaldini, and fettucine were all excellent. Came as a walk-in for 2 Friday night around 9 and they only had outdoor tables available. It was a little chilly, but they'd thought of this in advance and provided blankets to my girlfriend and myself. The somm was friendly and accommodating. Within minutes of ordering the clams were out, within minutes of that our table was full as we'd ordered the fritelle previously noted and the cauliflower. The cauliflower was good, but not exceptional. The fritelle were soft, doughy, and cheesy like a mix between a zeppole and gougeres. The clams were unbelievably flavorful. The calabrian chilies and the toasted bread crumbs made the dish balanced flavor-wise and texturally.Our entrees were great as well, though the mafaldini was not as hot temperature-wise as we would have liked. It wasn't cold, but it seemed it may have taken a little longer than it should have to get to our table. Texturally it was spot on however. The fettucine sausage dish was a standout. I've eaten many, many ragus/bolognese style dishes in my life and this one was one of the best I've ever had. The lamb sausage and the fennel seed lent a nice combination of flavors that was subtle but different than your standard meat-based sauce, and we kept going back for more even after we'd both admitted we were full.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198811,"We wanted to like Lilia more, But, sadly it did not live up to the hype. The hosts were quite full of themselves (see saga below) and while the sauces were excellent, our appetizer and both pastas were disappointingly under-cooked.HOSTING - We called in advance and were politely informed that they were booked. But, then kindly told that since is was early and they were not yet crowded, if we came over quickly, we could get a table. But when we arrived in less the 10 minutes, the hosts were utterly aloof and haughty. They had the air of security guards ferreting out a potential terrorist. When we asked for a table, they gave us this incredulous gasp and stated, ""You mean, you DON'T have reservations!?!"" We looked at each other in horror, what happened to the sweet person on the phone that had just urged us minutes earlier to race over? To break this awkward pregnant pause, I leaned over and revealed the fact that we had just called, and were encouraged to stop by. ""Well...? The lead host responded icily. ""All we can do is seat out you OUTSIDE!"" and pointed back behind us as if we would be sitting on the steps with the other riff raff.As it turned out, the outside cafe tables were much more relaxed than the stuffiness inside. Our server was pleasant, lighthearted, and fairly attentive. But there were problems throughout the rest of our meal. And, we sadly experienced a lot of ""BUTS""...BEER - a nice selection, BUT both our choices were flat as a pancake. So, we switched to wine.CAULIFLOWER - the spicy Soppressata pesto sauce was wonderful. The pretty tri-colorful cauliflower looked great, BUT was significantly under-cooked and overly crunchy. Maybe a cleaver could have worked to get thru the stalks, but not our knives. The sauce was quite tasty, BUT was thin and didn't stick to the cauliflower. So we order some bread.BREAD - it would have soaked up the Cauliflower sauce nicely, BUT it was totally burned on the hidden underside of each piece (did the kitchen really think we wouldn't notice the taste of ash when we took a bite!?!) So we pulled apart the edible half, and left the burnt bones.(BTW - the server never commented/apologized/acknowledged on plate of ""blacked charcoal"" sitting off to the side or the 1/2 full bowl of Cauliflower chunky stalks when he cleared the plates. Oh well.)PASTA #1 (Corzetti, Chanterelles, Savory, Aged Goat Cheese)Simply wonderful Chanterelle mushroom sauce that was truly finger-lickin' good. BUT, the Corzetti pasta, which were like flat disks of pasta dough cut with a juice glass, were sadly less than al dente, and had the taste of raw dough.PASTA #2 (Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey)Great combination of unique flavors in the filling, BUT the edges of the Agnolotti that were pinched-closed were quite underdone and hard.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10235,"Does Lilia live up to the hype? In my opinion, no. Is it still a great restaurant? Yes. Our group had 10pm reservations for a Sunday night, which was the only time I could get when I was booking a month out. This place is very popular! Food: Everything we had was great, but the real stars here are the appetizers.Cacio e pepe fritelle- SO GOOD. Pillowy and delicious, while capturing the flavors of a classic casio e pepe pastaBagna cauda- This is a hot fish dip with vegetables. Which sounds a bit gross, but is actually wonderful. The dip is warm and the crisp variety of vegetables complement it perfectly.Whole artichoke- I love artichokes and this one was cooked perfectly.Cured sardines- Personally am not a fan of sardines, and I still enjoyed this dish. The fatty butter, sour capers, and fishy sardines come together wonderfully. Crispy little fish- These were amazing. They are exactly what they sound like- crispy little fishMalfadini- In reading reviews for Lilia in the papers, I came to think of this as the item to order. And it was very good. The pasta is fresh, the pepper provides a pop without being overwhelming. But, I don't think it's worth waiting a month for a reservation for. Ricotta gnocci- The gnocci themselves were tender and delicious, but I found the sauce a bit too ""green"" tasting and thought it overpowered the delicate gnocciSheeps milk cheese filled agnoloti- Very good, a tad on the sweet side in my opinion. Not particularly exciting. Softserve- for desert, we had the vanilla and chocolate soft serve with various toppings. I thought this was a fun way to end the meal, and allowed for some level of customization. Our table preferred the vanilla to the chocolate.Service:Despite our 10pm reservation, we still had to wait at the bar for a bit. Service was attentive and our server made very helpful wine recommendations. Ambiance:Lilia feels very trendy and has the crowds to match. The decor itself is very clean and feels almost Nordic inspired.

The clams were juicy with a hint of sweet/sour spice and sprinkled with breadcrumbs to add a little crunch in every bite. It was perfect.The Malfadini was perfectly al dente and before coming here everyone suggested this dish. I enjoyed it but it was maybe a bit too peppery for my taste. I preferred the Fettucine with Lamb Sausage. The meat and sauce gave the dish the stronger flavor I was looking for.At this point, we were both pretty stuffed, but you can't leave without trying dessert! We settled for the chocolate softserve.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198776,"We really really wanted to love Lilia but unfortunately we were disappointed all around, from the service to the food. We arrived early for an 8:30pm res and the hostess led us to the back bar and told us the table would be ready shortly. ""Shortly"" was actually over 30 minutes later - we ended up getting drinks that we hadn't even wanted, and they did not apologize for the inconvenience at any point or offer to cover the drinks. Finally, we made it to our table. We had to flag down our waiter to order wine and food bc he wasn't attentive at all. He also had a lackadaisical attitude that completely took away from the experience. After all this, finally, the food. We felt everything was over-salted and the only two things we'd recommend were the trumpet mushrooms starter and the agnolotti with saffron, tomato, and honey. Both were delicious but definitely not mind-blowing. We eat took a bite of the cacio e pepe fritelle and couldn't have more than that because of the salt. The broth the artichoke came with barely had any flavor. The gnocchi dish had a delicious pesto but the gnocchis themselves were chewy and the opposite of 'melt in your mouth.'

So here it is:Food: totally decent. Not amazing, but solid italian food, they know pasta should be al dente and it is. Seems like good quality control in the kitchen. A bit too much salt in general. A bit too much sugar in deserts too. Appetizers and deserts were good, but nothing outstanding, let say I'd give it a 4 stars for the food.Wine: just tried one, but it made us happy. A totally ok Nebbiolo from Val d'Aoste at a reasonable price. Wine menu is ok, and don't go wild on the price. I'd go 4 stars.Landscape: that's just super weird. Clearly williamsburgish post 2015. I counted and really, I think the staff was like 25 to 30 heads. Ultimately, it should not be a problem for the clientele, but the thing is they are all hanging out there, in front of you, checking on you, and feeling a bit unoccupied. Really weird feeling honestly. Some of them look so much like in a video for a Williamsburg commercial, the mast brothers or the timmy brothers may be... that... hmm... does'nt feel right for an italian restaurant. And, gosh, Union avenue, what happened to you? Between the BQE and Mc Carren Park must be the worst architectural accomplishment of Brooklyn over the last decade. I'd give a 1 or 2 stars for the landscape.Coffee. My espresso was actually absolutely perfect. Looks like they use beans from Joe, they said. Well, that was a good damn espresso like I rarely find in NY even using fancy small batch roasters. 5 stars here.Service: That's probably the drama. Checking on us literally every minute. Removing plates when you are not done. Removing wine glasses when the bottle is not finished. Speaking like a machine with a total lack of people intelligence and no empathy what so ever (hey, please, stop speaking to my french mum, she told you she could not understand you at all). It's a 1 star. Wonder why I left the tip I left, really. But, at the end of the day, what I take away is that this place is absolutely empty of any soul. Has no personality at all. I respect the fact that it's relatively quality food, and that prices could have been higher for such a new spot in Wburg (actually, I wonder how they make money with such a staff, and a space I don't want to know the price of...).But, yes, in the end, a restaurant without soul, without character is very sad and that's probably why I give only 2 stars.(oh and yes, prices are reasonables in general, but please don't sell this grappa from Poli that price - 17 $ - it's way too much)",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,14.3999996185,"stars,espresso,Food,fact,bit,pasta,tip,nothing,quality control,kitchen,Landscape,italian food,Some,price,avenue,bit,menu,deserts,deserts,stars,prices,price,salt,sugar,Nebbiolo,star,stars,mast brothers,grappa,staff,espresso,problem,thing,accomplishment,italian restaurant,brothers,stars,heads,clientele,front,feeling,commercial,video,Service,Coffee,Looks,beans,Val d'Aoste,place,soul,staff,empathy,price,personality,spot,prices,Appetizers,Williamsburg,Union,Brooklyn,Mc Carren Park,BQE,space,Joe,NY,soul,restaurant,end,money,character,reasonables,tip,plates,wine glasses,bottle,people intelligence,mum,lack,machine,Poli","7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,7,1,7,6,1","0.284713119268,0.0742467418313,0.0315809138119,0.0299580954015,0.0290995314717,0.0285127051175,0.0236682891846,0.0233352184296,0.0232366751879,0.0232366751879,0.0201114434749,0.0173891671002,0.0143120186403,0.0133235724643,0.0114166839048,0.011118545197,0.0107888234779,0.0101141855121,0.0100971031934,0.00990737229586,0.00955913122743,0.00898766238242,0.00886771921068,0.00885042734444,0.0088223060593,0.00858130026609,0.00850956421345,0.00827752053738,0.00823588576168,0.00809173844755,0.00736489146948,0.00725512532517,0.00725512532517,0.00723206531256,0.00675899581984,0.00675899581984,0.00605582911521,0.00592946680263,0.00592390121892,0.00592390121892,0.00591872446239,0.00591388624161,0.00591388624161,0.00545883085579,0.00540011143312,0.00539326667786,0.00539326667786,0.00522485654801,0.00491525791585,0.00458672223613,0.00458284653723,0.00449306610972,0.00419530179352,0.00401124358177,0.00400957651436,0.00393763557076,0.00382849108428,0.00350142573006,0.00349873537198,0.00349620077759,0.00349620077759,0.00349620077759,0.00340032484382,0.00319302501157,0.00319114211015,0.00317297200672,0.00317297200672,0.00317297200672,0.00311153265648,0.002775949426,0.00260540400632,0.00177285901736,0.00176415697206,0.00176324381027,0.00176324381027,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00176236685365,0.00164306128863"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,160871,"We visited Lilia tonight, just a little bit more than a week after opening. The restaurant is good, but certainly has room to improve as it fine tunes over its first few weeks. The prices are high enough to make this restaurant somewhere for special occasions. While any given dish isn't expensive, the portion size is small -- so you may need to end up ordering several dishes to make a full meal. Our meal ran about $60 per person with tip and a bit of wine.The menu is divided into several categories -- cocktail snacks, veggies, small fish, big fish, pasta and large entrees. There is a nice, but not large, wine list that runs around $12 per glass and starts at around $40 per bottle. My fiance and I opted for an order of bread and mozzarella (a cocktail snack), an order of grilled clams with bread crumbs (small fish) and an order of the ricotta gnocchi with broccoli pesto (pasta).The bread and mozzarella was a bit small for the price -- working out to three slices of bread with a slice of cheese on each. Maybe this was just an example of misplaced expectation, but I was hoping for a large ball of mozz. Overall, this dish had a nice flavor, but was hoping for something a bit more substantial.The clams also had an excellent taste. Unfortunately, they were as chewy as rubber. I'm not sure if this has to do with (a) cooking clams on a wood grill, (b) the lack of fresh delivery on the first day after the blizzard, or (c) bad sourcing. Whatever the reason, they left something to be desired at least in terms of texture.Finally, the gnocchi with broccoli pesto was awesome! We gobbled it up. It wasn't a large portion, but still ran almost $20.For dessert, we ordered an apple pastry with a scoop of gelato. This was an amazing dish, but note that if you ask for a scoop of gelato that will run another $8.Service was attentive, but maybe a bit awkward. With time, I'm sure the wait staff will feel a bit more comfortable and in command of the table.",4.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",2,1,0.10000000149,8.19999980927,"room,opening,Lilia,restaurant,example,prices,clams,tunes,somewhere,occasions,restaurant,meal,wine list,dish,bit,dishes,portion size,cocktail snacks,bread,categories,veggies,menu,tip,person,bit,scoop,bread,bread,meal,dish,fish,fish,pasta,pasta,mozzarella,order,order,mozzarella,order,fish,mozz,ricotta gnocchi,broccoli pesto,cocktail snack,price,slices,slice,something,entrees,glass,bottle,bread crumbs,fiance,each,cheese,gnocchi,expectation,ball,flavor,taste,apple pastry,portion,broccoli pesto,gelato,scoop,something,terms,texture.,dessert,dish,gelato,table,wait staff,command,cooking clams,rubber,sourcing,blizzard,delivery,lack,wood grill,reason,Service","2,4,1,2,7,7,7,5,2,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,6,7,7","0.11789458245,0.0570119731128,0.0441878251731,0.0381043478847,0.0294223781675,0.0291105043143,0.0290367733687,0.0272868070751,0.0271477773786,0.0271477773786,0.0240970868617,0.0233460944146,0.0216664839536,0.0171371456236,0.0155927715823,0.0139999305829,0.0126812821254,0.0118020363152,0.0112118776888,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.0103283450007,0.00957116764039,0.0094825103879,0.00939152389765,0.00939152389765,0.00918904878199,0.00912766810507,0.00876375380903,0.00876375380903,0.00876375380903,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.0087265027687,0.00797288026661,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00793800596148,0.00724153826013,0.00697558745742,0.00695949746296,0.00695949746296,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00694592297077,0.00643784599379,0.00634581502527,0.00634581502527,0.00633635371923,0.00633635371923,0.00591587740928,0.00573290651664,0.00539149949327,0.00538097880781,0.00538097880781,0.00474980054423,0.00471728062257,0.00471728062257,0.00470807403326,0.0046934527345,0.00372270517983,0.00325433001854,0.00325433001854,0.00325433001854,0.00260331947356,0.002073954558,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.00207144930027,0.002069164766,0.00164217909332"

You can sit inside or outside at a few tables while you wait. Inside seating for dinner can be at the bar or a table and there is also outside seating. Across from the front door is a larger area to sit (I think it's actually part of the neighborhood) and there is a piano which was fun to sit down and play with while we waited. The wine was true Italian wines and delicious. We got the summer squash which was a little salty but still pretty good. The cucumbers with feta was also good but a bit spicy. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and I got the mezzaluna. I wish there was a little more food on my plate because I got about 10 pasta shells but it was very good.

You get the impression the clients and workers know each other's stories well.  They are not interested in the information- they are interested in the person. I also was impressed with the clientele and the cultured manner with which they carried themselves.  Don't to be fooled; the franchise attracts these types of persons because of food as well as the elegant manner of the owners. I observed parents bringing their children for a slice after a violin lesson, a Kindergarten girl being tutored by her father next to me and men who were alone eating a slice but with a sense of serenity which belies solitude. My companion that day said she was coming back.  My sentiments exactly.

Lillian Pizzeria,5545,9601 69th Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,118717,"I saw this interview with ""the Ray Romano"" on TV. He said he grew up on this pizza and it's still the same as it was when he was a little boy. So I decided if he thinks he knows Pizza I think I know Pizza let's see which one is better.So the first thing I noticed is that this location is off the beaten path. The next thing is that it is definitely a neighborhood Pizzaria. And lastly they don't accept credit cards. It's cash and carry only. So bring cash.So now to the pizza. I ordered a square and a slice, if your a New Yorker you know what that is, and if you're not that means a Sicilian Pizza and a slice of pizza. I didn't take any pictures because I ate it PDQ. So my verdict is, Ray Romano, you are correct in your opinion about Lillian's Pizza being pretty darn good. I still believe that the Pizzeria I grew up with in Manhattan is still a little bit better but this place is a real close second. Either way you would not be upset at getting pizza at either one of these locations. Lillian's is as original as New York Pizza can get. So if you're in the area, you would definitely not be upset with coming here and ordering a slice and or a square and having a trip back into the past.

There's no tomato sauce, so it tastes very light and dare I say, healthy. The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it.

Lillian Pizzeria,5545,9601 69th Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,35527,"I want to love Lillian, but alas I can only like it.I went to Lillian's hoping that this would be my new pizza spot.  I've had Gino's on Yellowstone, I've had Michael's on Yellowstone, and now it was time for Lillian--the pizza that was suppose to be the best around.  In my humble opinion, Lillian's was just ok, better than Gino's, about the same as Michael's, but not the best I've ever had.I called Lillian's to order a pie to pick up for dinner.  When I got there, I noticed that parking was a little tough.  I found a spot quickly enough due to someone else pulling.  Not a big deal and def not a deal breaker for future visits.  There is a liquor store next to Lillian's, so I thought I'd stop in, I had never been in there and like to frequent local businesses.  The liquor store manager was friendly and helpful.  I ended up buying a couple bottles of wine for me and my girlfriend.  Enough time had past that I figured the pie might be done.  I walked over hungry and eager.Lillian's is located conveniently on the corner, hard to miss.  Inside is your typical old style pizza joint.  I can't say there's anything remarkable about it, but you don't really need anything remarkable, it's a pizza place.  I go to the counter and ask for a pie that I had ordered over the phone.  The woman is friendly and brings it over.  Here's the rub though, cash only.  Cash only is one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to transactions.  There are so many non-cash solutions for business that there's no real excuse to not make it as easy as possible for customers to choose their preferred form of payment.  Still, not the biggest deal in the world that they are cash only.  Here's where things get worse though; they do not have an ATM in the place.  Why?  I get it, if you want to run a cash business, ok no problem, but at least have an ATM in the place to alleviate that pain point.  I asked the woman at the counter where was the closest ATM, expecting her to say down the block or something.  She says over on Yellowstone.  I found that hard to believe that there's a place running a cash-only business with the closest ATM being a 10min walk from them, which makes it 20min round-trip, not counting the walk back to the apt.  Fortunately I had the car, but def something to keep in mind if you're walking local.  She suggested I go get money from the liquor store.  Mind you, they don't have an ATM.  She wanted me to ask the guy at the liquor store to swipe my card and give me cash.I went to the ATM on Yellowstone and came back for the pie.  She seemed sorry that I had to go to all that trouble and again suggested that I could have gotten money from the liquor store guy.  I conveyed, in a gentle way, that I was not comfortable with that.  It's not about the fact that I could have gotten money from him, but rather that it wasn't his responsibility to provide cash for her business.  I would have considered it rude if I were in his shoes.I got home and the gf and I start in on the pizza.  It was good, but not the best I've ever had.  Pizza comes in all forms.  It's a gentle balance, a harmony of ingredients.  The best pizza has the cheese, sauce, and dough work together in perfect harmony.  Good pizza will highlight one or two ingredients.  Bad pizza is a complete imbalance of flavor and texture.  Lillian's was a good pizza, but highlighted the dough too much for my preference.  The sauce was ok, and the cheese was ok, but it was just dough on dough when in the mouth.  My friend Kevin would have loved it, but that's just not my preference.Things to note here:  -Lillian's is cash only!-If you like dough-y pizza, this is def for you.-Parking might be difficult, but shouldn't be a deal breaker",3.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",4,0,0.0,16.0,"Lillian,pizza spot,pizza,Cash,ATM,pizza

Lillian Pizzeria,5545,9601 69th Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,175778,"I've been coming to Lillian's for as long as I can remember (I used to live a couple of blocks away). I know what you're gonna say -- that because I've been a lifelong patron that my view is skewed. I'm a big pizza fan, and I'll grab a slice from any local pizza place. The regular slices here at Lillian's are good, but nothing you can't get at other pizza places. The crust is thin and crunchy, and, for the most part, can stand up to the cheese and sauce. The Sicilian pizza is why I love this place. I feel like ever other pizza place I've been to make a Sicilian pie the exact same way they make a regular pie, just square and with a thicker crust. Not at Lillian's. If you get a regular slice and a slice of Sicilian, they taste completely different. Their sauce is wonderfully flavored and crust is thick, but not super thick and is very crispy. The cheese even taste different. I brought my girlfriend once and she had a Sicilian slice and was hooked ever since. The place is on 69th Avenue between Groton and Harrow Streets, smack in the middle of a residential zone.

Lillian Pizzeria,5545,9601 69th Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,7742,"Oh my goodness!! Best pizza I've ever had in Queens! (And definitely one of the top 10 pizzerias in all of nyc, in my opinion.) Tucked away on an unassuming street in the quaint Forest Hills Gardens neighborhood, this mom and pop pizzeria turns pizza-making into an art form!I ordered a slice of their garlic/tomato and plain pizzas while my bf ordered a calzone. The calzone was only ok, but man, those slices of pizza were scrumptious! I like to make sure a pizzeria serves a solid plain slice before trying their other slices, because no pizzeria deserves praise unless they can master the basics, right? Let me tell you, Lillian serves a mean plain pizza! Perfect crust to sauce to cheese ratio, fresh and flavorful ingredients, cheese that melts and strings with each delectable bite, crispy crust with just enough pillowy doughy goodness to delight your senses... Ahh, pure pizza heaven!After stuffing my face with the plain pizza, I dove into the garlic/tomato pizza with twice as much fervor cause now I knew that Lillian's pizza meant business! My tastebuds practically sang with joy with each bite. Perfect balance of garlic and tomato flavor and, again, super fresh ingredients (in fact, the tomato was so freshly sliced, it was still crisp and sweet, not wilted and soggy like the tomato slices you get on most pizzas).You know how you know that I'm not lying when I say that this was the best pizza I've ever had in Queens (and arguably all of nyc)? I was satisfactorily full after the two slices but I still went back for one more! They had three pizzas available when I was ordering and after finish those two slices of heaven, I just couldn't resist trying the third: Salad pizza! Man... I'm salivating just thinking about that third slice. As full as I already was, I ravenously stuffed my face with the third. It was that good. Like a high-end, flavor-packed salad atop an expertly baked pizza crust, the salad pizza represented the best of both worlds: soft mozzarella mixed with a hint of tangy ranch dressing, gently enveloping crisply fresh cucumber slices, crunchy lettuce, and tender sweet tomatoes, all over one of the best pizza crusts you'll ever have the joy of eating.If you are lucky enough to be in the neighborhood, definitely make the trek to Lillian and definitely try all the pizza on display. Skip the calzone. I've heard good things about their garlic knots but other than that, stick to the pizza. This is a pizzeria for a reason!**Also, REMEMBER TO BRING CASH!Food: 5/5 -- Amazing. Simply amazing.Service: 4/5 -- Friendly and quick.Atmosphere: 3/5 -- Clean and spacious, just your typical pizzeria.

It's located on the corner of a very residential area, making it very inconspicuous. The decor is very mom and pop-ish and feels like your neighborhood pizzeria. There are a couple of tables, the counter and a soda fridge. We ordered a large pizza with some toppings, garlic knots and a parm sub. The pizza was spectacular!

Lily Thai,5546,615 Grand St,Brooklyn,11211.0,6692,"I was really pleased with this place. Definitely on par with Sri, right down the road. Although, it's really funny to me (and very telling) that Sri has become the standard to which all other Thai places are judged. The nice thing about this restaurant as opposed to Sri is that there is actually a place to sit. Imagine that! Instead of sitting at one of just a couple 2-seater tables, Lily Thai has tables that can comfortably seat a group of 4. There are roughly 10 tables, as opposed to 3 or 4 tables. You do the math, but this is a much better option if you're out with more than one friend, or at least one friend who enjoys their personal space.The ambiance is also much classier. They have cloth napkins, glass cups, and a waitress who speaks perfect English. Unlike Sri, she is not the line cook. Service here was attentive and pleasant.My entree was also much cheaper than most Thai places. It was $9 for vegetarian duck pad kee mao. Perfect levels of spicy, and very well cooked. When she first brought it out, it almost looked burnt, but I think that it was smoked to give it extra flavor? Regardless, it tasted great. The portions were a little smaller, but I actually prefer that because it saves room for dessert!I had the lychee ($4), which I've never had before. It came in a large wine glass and tasted a lot like pears. Not overly sweet, and the perfect compliment to a moderately spicy dinner.

Lily Thai,5546,615 Grand St,Brooklyn,11211.0,136890,"This is one of our go-to places for dinner when we're not in the mood (too tired) to cook! I've been going here for years (mostly take out delivery for 3 years and in store nomming for the past year) so I've eaten here a lot. I've eaten at a few others and they were overwhelmingly oily. I don't care if it's more authentic. I don't like it. This review is only for their in-house dining. I hate when people give bad complaints about their take out - you're only 2 blocks away, you lazy .... aaaanyways. Time is the killer for freshness of their food. I've had their take out for years and it never tasted as good as when I ate IN the restaurant. The husband LOVES their seafood noodle soup w/ broad rice noodle, bbq 1/2 chicken main dish and their chicken wings. Their chicken wings have a spicy & sweet sauce and are super crispy, just like I like 'em. I think it's some kind of cornmeal breading. So so good, and I'm super picky about my wings (only really like Korean chicken wings).  I LOVE LOVE LOVE  their veggie & tofu noodle soup with broad rice noodle (my favorite soup in a restaurant, ever - better than any ramen soup at one of those bazillion ramen shops now invading the city). The broth is light and perfectly flavorful. I love that it doesn't taste oily or porky. They also have the best veggie dumplings in the city. It's boiled and light - and they can stick together sometimes. It has thin skin and the perfect amount of assorted filling. It's not heavy or oily or jammed with useless vegetables. I can't find dumplings like these anywhere else. I do not like thick doughy dumplings (like that that OTHER thai place a few blocks away that made me pay $6 for literally the worst dumplings I've ever had in my life, including frozen ones I've made myself)  We've had great luck with their other stuff - ie. Green Curry (I asked for soft tofu b/c I hate spongy tofu); Pork fried rice - some of the best fried rice I've eaten; Sauteed veggies and a few others that I can't think of. We never had a bad experience here, though sometimes the kitchen is a bit inconsistent when you come at certain times. The staff is super friendly and the interior is really adorable and intimate.

I ordered the summer rolls, curry puffs, pad thai, and a thai tea. The summer rolls were freakishly small and had a bizarre mushy texture. The dipping sauce was the only thing that made them edible. The curry puffs were undercooked and pastry dough on the inside was gooey. The flavor was ok, but they weren't cooked thoroughly! The pad thai was completely flavorless. How is that even possible?! And lastly, the thai tea was roughly 95% condensed milk. Even after I let it water down for a bit it was too sweet to be palatable. I was starving and exhausted when my order arrived and would have eaten anything vaguely edible, which is why I ate what was delivered to me.

Lily Thai,5546,615 Grand St,Brooklyn,11211.0,11041,"There was a time that we traveled in a pickup truck round the neighborhood, able to dine wherever we wanted in a 15 minute radius. I'd roll the windows down, smoke a butt and point at a new awning or storefront. Lily Thai was one of these places, and it did not disappoint. I usually start any meal at a Thai joint with spring rolls or gari pup, both of which were scrumptious. The gari pup pastry was golden and flaky, and the mild curried chicken/potato filling was wonderful. The spring rolls were not too oil laden, which is tres important. My main course, beef Pad Ki Mao could have been a bit more spicy, but I think they were doing a little racial profiling. The next time I requested that it be prepared spicier and they complied - the dish was perfect. When the truck days ended we assumed we'd be stuck with the usual delivery options (nothing special, bordering on unpleasant). I called Lily Thai on a whim and it turned out they delivered. Delivery is never quite as good as in house, but it comes close. The spring rolls arrive kind of drenched in oil, but everything else is on par.

A seven dollar bottle of barefoot wine was of far superior quality to the food we at at this place.  We had rubbery fish cakes that we couldn't finish, salad with a peanut sauce way too peanutty...that again I couldn't finish....and really who can't finish a salad?  We also had tolerable steamed dumplings that unfortunately had a dipping sauce too thick and too sweet. I was hoping for a standard soy and vinegar type sauce to go with them...would have worked better. We also had Chicken satay which wasn't awful...but I've made better at home.  The best part of my meal was the Tom Yum soup....which is a favorite of mine all the time and here was merely tolerable...not notable.  The decor was nice, the service fast and pleasant...but I wouldn't go back.  No way!",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,5.09999990463,"favorite,quality,reviews,Thai,fish cakes,dumplings,service,bottles,place,liquor shops,glass,one,dollar bottle,peanut sauce,sauce,wine,quality,place,salad,salad,street,food,Chicken satay,BYOB,part,home,meal,way,Tom Yum,vinegar type sauce,soy","7,7,5,2,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,1,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,3,7,7","0.139356926084,0.109191097319,0.0939864516258,0.0869421362877,0.0455293208361,0.0443124659359,0.0361873544753,0.030481511727,0.030481511727,0.0266851950437,0.0266851950437,0.0266851950437,0.0245267264545,0.0225359294564,0.0205882377923,0.0205509979278,0.0205509979278,0.0205509979278,0.0205037016422,0.0187675282359,0.0180378574878,0.0179870389402,0.0163011457771,0.0158247575164,0.0145634273067,0.0122150816023,0.0121988020837,0.00842996500432,0.00722559727728,0.00674733053893,0.00536953750998"

I ordered the vegetable Panang curry and they sent me chicken instead. I mixed all of the rice in before I realized, and being a vegetarian I couldn't eat it. I called them to ask for the correct order and they said they would make it and send it right over. I waited another half an hour only to receive the curry with no rice. Why wouldn't you send another order of rice if that's what's supposed to come with the curry?? When I called again, the guy said that the first order already came with rice.

Here are my ""must haves"" (but feel free to pick some of your own!): Kang Puk Soup (delicious, delicious, five-star soup -- not to be missed!), Spring Rolls and Fried Tofu (as appetizers -- the dipping sauces are excellent!), Chicken Pad Sea Ew, and Shrimp Pad Thai (typical Thai dishes, but amazing!). I have to admit, we got into a little bit of a rut, often getting and sharing these same things over and over again! But earlier on when we were more adventuresome, everything we tried was excellent. Heed a warning from me here: some of the curries are EXTREMELY SPICY. Ask your server if you're not sure. Some curries were TOO spicy for me to eat. (I ended up diluting them with sour cream at home!) The flavor was great, so if you like spicy, you will love it, but just proceed with caution!The service is fast and attentive.

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Everything was delicious.  We ordered a bunch of different items (chicken pad thai, tom yum soup, chicken fried rice, spring rolls and more) and did it smorgasbord style.  We made it disappear on some David Copperfield sh*t.  In short, Lily Thai instantly turned into my go-to Thai spot in the neighborhood.  Hopefully it can become the same for you.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,6.09999990463,"Leilani M,review,Cheers Thai,Metropolitan Ave,faith,Lily Thai,food,fact,craving hits,thanks,faith,chicken pad thai,crib,drinking,dancing,trash talk,way,plethora,menus,delivery,place,suggestion,Williamsburg,Queens,go,style,more,spring rolls,chicken fried rice,tom yum soup,items,Vanessa U.,W'Burg,same,sh*t,spot,neighborhood,Lily Thai,food,food,Everything,quality,bunch,David Copperfield","1,5,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,2,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.237824171782,0.132363468409,0.088306799531,0.0588463246822,0.053772598505,0.0253050718457,0.0241947900504,0.0180930811912,0.0180274490267,0.0179767031223,0.0138807483017,0.0124251740053,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0121479937807,0.0111183440313,0.0110927214846,0.0110927214846,0.0107258949429,0.0106869162992,0.0089891673997,0.00822732690722,0.00822732690722,0.00822732690722,0.00822732690722,0.00822732690722,0.00822732690722,0.00719721801579,0.00719721801579,0.00644787726924,0.00569167314097,0.00568590359762,0.00568590359762,0.00508729275316,0.0045553650707,0.00454856967553,0.00431673927233,0.00361960148439,0.00361040490679,0.0033698992338"

The Thai Iced Teas were pretty awesome, probably the best I've had, however, they do advertise one price for them then charge you more once your bill comes. The Spring Rolls as an app were pretty good too. I had high hopes, I thought I found another Thai place to frequent in case Cheers ever had a fire again, however when my main course came (Tofu Pad Thai) it sort of ruined the experience for me. Like I mentioned above, maybe grease is what Thai food is all about. Other than the aforementioned Cheers Restaurant -  who I find not to be very greasy and my personal fav - every time I order Pad Thai anywhere else, greasy is what I get. I'm going to say it's just my taste buds. Yet, this place does sort of false advertise... not just about the Thai Iced Tea, but on a Saturday they leave out a basket full of menus for  ""Lunch Specials"" but once again, when you get your bill, you realize the lunch specials are only for Mon-Fri.

Lily Thai,5546,615 Grand St,Brooklyn,11211.0,1964,"""Yum nuer, with a side of rice."" I probably say this phrase on the phone more often than any other, that's how much a fan I am of LIly Thai's beef salad with red onion, romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, in an addictive limey, fish saucy dressing. Tossed with some rice, it's my favorite takeout meal. My other favorites of theirs is the wonton soup with egg noodles (perfect soupy dinner for a winter night) and the Thai Fried Rice with pork and brown rice. Probably the best takeout fried rice I've had (the brown rice version is ten times better than the regular version, by the way). I'm a little surprised to see this place get 3.5 stars.

They had a lunch special promo plastered on their glass walls but we were not given said menu when we sat down and only given the regular menu... not a good sign. Prices are a bit ridiculous for where this restaurant is located. Ordered their Tamal and Ceviche Mixto to start. The tamal was well seasoned and the texture was very nice as well. The ceviche was not too heavy on the onions and veggie garnish, as I like to call it, but was a generous portion of fish, octopus, squid and shrimps. The seafood needed a bit more time to marinate though. We shared the super combo: whole chicken, rice&beans,  a heap of maduros, avocado salad and salchipapa aka fried hot dogs and french fries. Nothing to really to write home about this typical combo that you would get at any of the Peruvian chicken places...I do have to comment that their beans were nicely seasoned and delicious. Oh and they had this ridiculously delicious cold purple corn juice that had notes of lime and cinnamon that they really should bottle up and sell!  Don't like the prices but will be back.",4.0 star rating,"Point Lookout, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,7.90000009537,"food,friend,lunch,server,promo,glass walls,tamal,ceviche,corn juice,menu,notes,combo,texture,menu,Tamal,combo,Prices,sign,restaurant,onions,garnish,veggie,portion,squid,shrimps,fish,octopus,seafood,chicken places,any,Ceviche Mixto,prices,lime,cinnamon,Peruvian,french fries,chicken,hot dogs,avocado salad,maduros,heap,rice&beans,home,beans,Nothing","7,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7","0.145178765059,0.139113977551,0.139113977551,0.0699689388275,0.0224248114973,0.0224248114973,0.0204872824252,0.0204474069178,0.0191493332386,0.0182132776827,0.017976231873,0.0179620161653,0.0179310105741,0.0173149295151,0.0172034315765,0.0167975500226,0.0161948129535,0.0151533205062,0.0150982672349,0.0149917444214,0.0149917444214,0.0149917444214,0.014617132023,0.0137209380046,0.0137209380046,0.0137209380046,0.0137209380046,0.0136977713555,0.0102086029947,0.0102086029947,0.00891958363354,0.00826854724437,0.00706144748256,0.00706144748256,0.00604565953836,0.00512707652524,0.00512707652524,0.00448568491265,0.00448568491265,0.00448568491265,0.00448568491265,0.00448568491265,0.00447969697416,0.0044232616201,0.00431251339614"

The second time I ordered the same with the addition of a mixed civiche, lamb shank special and mussels. First time I came here the chicken was absolutely delectable, one of the best I've ever tasted. It was moist, fall off the bone tender and extremely tasty with the addition of their spices. Jalea was pretty typical, the service however was nonexistent at the time as the waiter came once got my order and left never to be seen again. Great food poor serviceSecond time I came around came with a bigger group so i ordered more food. Jalea was around the same quality, mussels were okay nothing special, civiche was tender and well done, not too sour with too much lime, but the lamb shank special that day was phenomenal, the sauce was a sort of brown sauce reminiscent of a soy sauce braise, which was incredibly new and innovative. The chicken that day was too salty and incredibly dry. Felt as if they left it in the rotisserie for too long. The service however was on point, the same waiter came around and was aware of our need for water and more green sauce.

Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,6131,"My wife and I spent about 5 weeks in Peru, traveling between Lima, Cusco, Aguas Calientes, and Puno.  We sampled the cuisine in all parts of the country.  We had street food, hovel food, home cooked food, midling restaurant food, and exquisite food.  We even went to a Peruvian Indian (as in India) restaurant.  And a French place too.You would be hard pressed to find food this good in Peru.  One restaurant comes to mind -- we sat in a 300 year old colonial dining room where the waitstaff stood at attention by the table and snapped to the instant they were needed.  You know what?  The food at Lima 33 is better.  Does that make Lima 33 authentic or not?The restaurant is a little upscale.  Appropriate for a date  Service is impeccable.Yucca Fries and Green Sauce: A+The gratis food they put down on the table before you order, like how Chinese restaurants used to do in the 80's with those fried noodles.  Obviously just cooked recently because they were fresh and still very warm, they are *seriously* addicting, both with and without the green sauce.  I thought my baby was going to have a heart attack when we ate them all.  My daughter was also unhappy too.Tamal Limeño: A+One of the best tamals I've ever had.  I've been disappointed with really bad tamals -- some are flavorless, some are so wet they become goopy.  Some have a weird aroma from the banana leaves.  This one was absolutely perfect.  I never order the same thing twice at a restaurant, and I'd *definitely* consider getting this again.  Beautiful flavor with just the right amount of moisture: moist without being gelatinous.  The pickled onions it's served with is divine.Ceviche de Pescado: AOne of the better ceviches I've had.  Better than any ceviche I've had in Latin America.  This one has just fish, no squid / calamari which I don't care for because it never gets tender in ceviche, so the ceviche de pescado is perfect for me.  I'm not giving this an A+ simply because the onions needed to be marinated more; they still had too much of a raw onion bite.Avocado Salad: A+Ordered this for my baby, and it was DELICIOUS.  Very fresh and vibrant, but I wouldn't order this for one person.  It's pretty big -- more appropriate for 2 or 3 people.  I mean, look at my picture.  Doesn't it LOOK wonderful?Tacu Tacu con Carne AWe had this in Peru a few times, and this was by far the best tacu tacu we've had.  The meat was phenomenally tender and tasty.  We asked for medium rare, and that's EXACTLY the way the chef cooked it.  Expertly cooked!  The rice was and beans were wonderful.  Again, moist and flavored deliciously  Literally the best tacu tacu con carne we've ever had.Chupe de Camarones: A+A Peruvian shrimp chowder.  Thick, hearty, and creamy.  They don't skimp on the shrimp.  There almost seemed to be too much shrimp (which is a good thing)  The rice gives the chowder a beautiful consistency.  What's more, there was no iodine flavor in the shrimp, indicating high quality seafood.  This is one of the best wintery soups imaginable.  If you order it, ask them to make sure it's very, very hot.",5.0 star rating,"Bayside, NY",4,0,0.40000000596,19.6000003815,"food,shrimp,Lima,wife,hovel food,food,restaurant food,food,street food,restaurant,Puno,Aguas Calientes,Cusco,baby,country,parts,cuisine,home,place,good,Peru,dining room,one,restaurant,some,food,restaurant,Ceviche de Pescado,onions,Peruvian Indian,India,French,calamari,fish,upscale,table,food,restaurants,restaurant,mind,attention,waitstaff,instant,date Service,onions,one,tamals,tamals,one,ceviches,ceviche,ceviche,Some,daughter,some,table,green sauce,thing,flavor,pescado,much,Green Sauce,fried noodles,both,heart attack,aroma,banana leaves,moisture,amount,rice,squid,ceviche,tacu,Yucca Fries,rice,meat,A+One,shrimp chowder,times,way,carne,iodine flavor,shrimp,Tamal Limeño,Chinese,chowder,Latin America,A+,more,chef,seafood,soups,Peruvian,Chupe de Camarones,onion,more,consistency,person,people,picture,beans,Tacu Tacu,Carne AWe,Avocado Salad","7,7,2,1,7,7,6,7,7,2,1,1,2,1,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,3,2,2,6,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,1,1,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,6,2,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,5,7,1,7,7","0.0456734001637,0.0434615649283,0.0389203988016,0.0375919193029,0.0292264893651,0.0292264893651,0.0292264893651,0.0292264893651,0.0292264893651,0.0268181804568,0.0223246067762,0.0223246067762,0.0223246067762,0.0216512344778,0.0179333295673,0.0179333295673,0.0179333295673,0.0178416855633,0.0177268888801,0.0177268888801,0.0173657275736,0.0172023195773,0.0143267903477,0.013660537079,0.0135586336255,0.0135309593752,0.0124389166012,0.0114961853251,0.0112928971648,0.0105371326208,0.0105371326208,0.0105074131861,0.0104703381658,0.0104703381658,0.00834094267339,0.00772545859218,0.00744240684435,0.00685117859393,0.00680527696386,0.00675970362499,0.00675970362499,0.00675970362499,0.00675970362499,0.00671609817073,0.00633426243439,0.00615171808749,0.00567880831659,0.00567347742617,0.00561019126326,0.00556639488786,0.00556277763098,0.00555933918804,0.00545706180856,0.00539662921801,0.0053251395002,0.00518244272098,0.00517618656158,0.00514770764858,0.00514398002997,0.00503457523882,0.00468373345211,0.00454527558759,0.00453425105661,0.00452877627686,0.00452378438786,0.00451100664213,0.00451100664213,0.00450059399009,0.00450059399009,0.00417264038697,0.0041104061529,0.0041104061529,0.00410042656586,0.00397670269012,0.00396004179493,0.00365552050062,0.00361881242134,0.00349259958602,0.00306243519299,0.00305955903605,0.00305561278947,0.00288323895074,0.00285922060721,0.00285044149496,0.00268423836678,0.00250876578502,0.00243473332375,0.00243179220706,0.00241422490217,0.00225674384274,0.00211209524423,0.00211134087294,0.00206738384441,0.00180864159483,0.00169138167985,0.00153828994371,0.00150018581189,0.00134498660918,0.00134426075965,0.00134356482886,0.00132356467657,0.000998892704956,0.000846787064802,0.000796427309979"

We were greeted immediately when we entered and the lady said it would be about 20 minutes before we were seated and I was thankful because I was so hungry! We were seated in the back room in the corner. This restaurant is small but it did not feel that way because you had enough room to move around and etc. The AC however was booming so make sure you bring a sweater if you plan on visiting in the summer. For our appetizer, my sister & I ordered the beef skewers, absolutely delicious. The meat was cooked just well & had a good amount of seasoning. For our entree, my sister ordered the aji de galina (I think that was the name lol) it was chicken cooked in a creamy sauce & came with a side of white rice. I ordered the half chicken, with sweet plantains, and the sarapas (fried hotdogs over French fries). Everything was so good, the chicken was cooked nicely & the flavoring was just right; the fried plantains were sweet and scrumptious and went well the chicken; the French fries were crunchy and hot just the way I like them. Oh! & how could forget to mention the oh so delicious yucca fries, those were everything! They came with a mayonnaise and cilantro sauce that just completed this dish. Yum!

The first time I ate here my husband brought the lomo saltado home as a Togo order and it was one of the best we've had so we vowed to eat in next time. So for my second visit my daughter and I came in on a Wednesday evening around 5:30 and had dinner. The place is pretty small but it's cozy and fortunately it was empty though when we ordered Togo previously the place was packed. The decor is very pretty and fresh. We were greeted immediately by a gentleman that ended up as our server. He was so nice and really made our experience comfortable. It's not often that you get sincerely nice service here in the city so this place is a keeper for that alone. We ordered jalea to start and it was very well made. I'm not a fan of the large, onion ring looking(I prefer the smaller less chewy) calamari but they fry it to perfection so I couldn't resist. For dinner I had the arroz con mariscos which is their take on paella and it was really good. My daughter had the lomo saltado and it was very good also. I was very impressed that they serve complimentary fried yucca with their Peruvian sauce as a starter. This mixed with the great service makes this place a favorite for me.

I want to let people know that it you have any type of stomach issue/disease this might not be the right fit for you- we go out to many restaurants of all different type of food options that actually cater to the restaurant goers needs but this is not the place.  The waiter tried his best but at the end of the day my family only had 1 plate that they could choose that they were willing to accommodate.  So the reason I still gave a high rating is because the food was honestly delicious! After the nightmare of finding something on the menu for 3 out of the 4 people my family and I were very delighted with how well the food tasted. My boyfriend and father ordered the lomo only cooked with onions and the other only with tomato and they both stated that the steak was cooked to perfection. The only complaint my father had was that the steak wasn't enough for him. I ordered the tallarines verde (which also came with a very nice size steak ) and I found my dish to be delicious.  The pesto was very light tasting which I enjoyed (because I don't like when it's over powering) and the steak was cooked and season perfectly; the portion was way more than enough for 1 person as I had left overs for the next day. The desert we ordered was the mil hojas cakes which is actually one of my favorites, the ice cream scoop on the side was so tasting it left me wanting more. Overall the experience at this restaurant was definitely an uncomfortable one since the options were limited for my family, but everyone did enjoy the meal.  ** one thing I didn't like is that they sold drinks by the can or cup, fountain soda is so much more ideal especially when they charge $3 for a can a coke. ** the waiter was nice but telling us that we are taking too long to order and that he has other tables to wait did not feel so welcoming, I understand that my family was a bit more difficult but at the end of the day we are paying customers and from someone who works in customer service, you have to have patience with people and not rush or make them feel like they are not important. ; he did ease up by the end of the dinner but that still sank with me.",4.0 star rating,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,8.60000038147,"family,restaurant,family,stomach issues,post,cakes,tasting,restaurants,idea,type,food options,waiter,reviews,father,waiter,people,customers,Peruvian,restaurants,place,fit,something,stomach issue,type,steak,food,end,restaurant goers needs,disease,plate,best,someone,steak,size steak,people,food,steak,reason,complaint,father,other,portion,desert,rating,menu,nightmare,perfection,boyfriend,lomo,onions,tomato,dish,tallarines verde,person,fountain soda,ice cream scoop,drinks,coke,cup,can,tables,people,customer service,patience,dinner,restaurant,everyone,thing,experience,more,options,one,side,favorites,meal","1,2,1,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,5,1,1,1,1,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,6,6,7,6,7,1,7,7,4,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7","0.16545933485,0.149709433317,0.0561215132475,0.0447995588183,0.0392546579242,0.0362132191658,0.0349161550403,0.030485143885,0.0229460652918,0.0213110800833,0.0207293387502,0.0206542611122,0.0187530331314,0.0147456517443,0.0134021956474,0.0129385832697,0.011289938353,0.0111217116937,0.010245016776,0.00885042641312,0.00873911846429,0.00861272402108,0.00815576408058,0.00815576408058,0.00768471043557,0.00718305911869,0.00716268783435,0.00713673140854,0.00713673140854,0.00711078103632,0.00684571359307,0.00659841392189,0.00644718529657,0.00642669713125,0.00600211462006,0.00600211462006,0.00587357115,0.00586387654766,0.00568324234337,0.0054488661699,0.0054488661699,0.00518626114354,0.00518000219017,0.00478794844821,0.00477689970285,0.00477689970285,0.0047675780952,0.0047675780952,0.0047675780952,0.0047675780952,0.0047675780952,0.00475241988897,0.00475241988897,0.00434321071953,0.003961305134,0.00381217477843,0.00323413847946,0.00323413847946,0.00323413847946,0.00323413847946,0.00323110143654,0.00281129148789,0.00223699468188,0.00223699468188,0.00223699468188,0.002039675368,0.00199962127954,0.00173748726957,0.00169569021091,0.00162472308148,0.00162293110043,0.00151277019177,0.00142138020601,0.00142138020601,0.00140191754326"
Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,6348,"Friend discovered a Peruvian place reminiscent of Pio Pio only about 10 minutes away from work. Three of us arrived around 6pm for a Friday dinner and we were seated in the side room. Decor was cute with pink booths and photos spanning the wall. They started us off with complimentary yuca fries with this amazing sauce. We ordered glasses of sangria and the Super Combinacion to share, which is their equivalent of Pio Pio's Matador Combo: whole rotisserie chicken, salchipapas, rice and beans, plantains and an avocado salad. The price was a bit cheaper than Pio Pio's and the food was pretty comparable.

I was really surprised to see a Peruvian restaurant had opened up about 4 months ago and decided to take my family there last night. It was one of the most pleasant dining experiences I ever had. The service was phenomenal and the staff was extremely friendly. The moment you sit down you get a complimentary side order of fries with their delicious signature green sauce. We ordered the ceviche mixto which was THE best I've ever had and full flavor and perfect level of a spiciness. We practically licked the remaining sauce off the plate. For entrees, we had the arroz con mariscos, tacu tacu, and the chicken and all three were absolutely amazing. The amount of flavors infused into all of their food is astonishing. The rice in the arroz con mariscos and tacu tacu were very flavorful and delicious along with the seafood and steak. But the highlight of the night was their chicken. I'd like to start off by saying I am a big fan of Pio Pio and there were many nights I would get into my car and drive to Midtown Manhattan to pick up Peruvian chicken when we were all craving it. I'm so glad I won't have to be doing that anymore since Lima 33 has outdone them. I honestly think that the chicken was definitely better here than at Pio Pio... and it was obvious from the very first bite. The portions were generous. We stuffed ourselves and still had plenty of leftovers to take home which I am eating right now for lunch!

Parking is extremely difficult because they have a tiny parking lot and there is minimal metered spaces. The family ordered a few appetizers and entrees to share, which we didn't care for including the corn meal stuffed with chicken wrapped in banana leaf, steamed mussels, corvina fish ceviche, Peruvian style fried rice and the sauteed seafood rice dish. And also the chicha morada, a Peruvian beverage, that tasted like my kid's cough medicine. We both got the rotisserie chicken combination, which came with a a side of avocado salad, french fries and sweet plantains (the side portions were large enough to share among family members). The dark meat of the chicken tasted great but I wish I could say the same about the white meat. Instead, the white meat was very dry and hard to eat even with their not so good, spicy (horseradish & mayo?) dipping sauce. The avocado salad had fresh vegetables in it but had too much dressing and the french fries and sweet plantains were plain in general. Honestly, the other half of the family members including us did not enjoy the meal as much as we wanted to. My aunt stated that this will be her first and last time having Peruvian food. However, the service was exceptional with our waiters always being attentive to serve our every need.

Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,14226,"OMG Lima 33 is soooooooooooo good! The location is right on Northern Blvd which is great for driving and for public transportation. I went with a group of 3 on a Saturday night around 7:30-8pm and could not have been happier with my experience.Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted and asked to wait at the bar while a table opened up. We didn't have to wait long, which was nice, but the bar is a little awkward to sit at because it literally is next to a line of tables, so when you sit at the bar, you're basically hovering over another party's table. Not sure what the point of this is, but nothing to really to complain about - just a bit odd!Anyway, once we were seated (PS: it's much nicer sitting inside the room towards the left), we were given menus, served water and FREE yuca fries with a delicious creamy white/green sauce. Let me tell you, I'm not even sure that I like yuca, but these were SO GOOD and it was just the beginning. It must be said that the service is great here. Friendly and attentive - what more could you ask for? And it definitely doesn't suck that the food is amazing! You can get all of your usual Peruvian dishes and sangria (a little sweet, but still good!), so no surprises or anything, but everything we had was definitely A+ quality food. We ordered the super combo which includes the chicken, rice & beans, salad and fries w/ hot dog slices, and the seafood fried rice. Wow, literally salivating just thinking about the meal we had.

Very hard to find a decent spot and the parking lot is small. Since it was our first time, my boyfriend and I decided to try an appetizer and the combination platter (similar to the matador combo from pio pio) For appetizer we got the pork tamal.. it was VERY underwhelming.. the ratio from filling to the corn was VERY off. I barely got any filling at all whatsoever and the the filling that I did get was very dry. I wouldn't bother getting this ever again.As the combination platter arrived I started to feel a bit better.. it comes with a whole chicken, sweet plantains, rice and beans, salchipapa and an avocado salad. The sweet plantain we're on point for sure.. the salchipapas could've been better, I like when the hot dogs are a little more well done. The rice was undercooked and the beans weren't memorable. The star of the entree was the chicken FOR sure... very moist, juicy and flavorful. The avocado salad was also very good! If I ever return I'm afraid I'd only order the chicken and the salad.The entire time I was eating my meal I felt like I was missing something.. which was a good sauce for dipping. They do have a green sauce but it wasn't anything spectacular.. I found myself dipping my chicken in the salad dressing just because I always need a good sauce on the side!

Our waiter was very attentive from start to finish. Upon seating, crispy golden yuca fries were brought to the table along with a spicy creamy green sauce. I never had yuca fries before but these were absolutely delicious. We had sweet plantains and sangria as our appetizer. The plantains were cooked perfectly; warm and luscious on the inside and a slight caramelized crunch on the outside. The red sangria was decent, it paired well with dinner. For our entrees we had lomo saltado and a Peruvian/Chinese spaghetti dish with chicken and vegetables. They were both very tasty and cooked perfectly. I was very happy that the vegetables (red bell peppers, red onions, tomatoes,and scallions) in both entrees was not over cooked at all.

Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,11020,"I was craving for some chicken, nothing fried but something more like rotisserie.  I told my brother I was thinking something like Chicken Lover in Queens and he said let's try something new, how about Lima 33? I was like huh? He said it's very much comparable to Pio Pio and it's right in my neighborhood- I'M IN!~Lima 33- a Peruvian restaurant in Little Neck (by the intersection of Little Neck Pkwy and Northern Blvd) where they serve up some awesome Peruvian dishes like whole rotisserie chicken, skirt steak, rice and beans and etc! Parking: Street Parking is not too bad, even on a Saturday night, I was able to find parking without circling around.  TIP: If you don't want to pay for meters, circle around to the residential area in the back for free street parking!Seating: Roomy and trendy, I was immediately captured by the blue lights and art pieces on the wall once entering the restaurant.  There are a good amount of seats (estimate more than 30) but if you are coming during the weekends, definitely call ahead and make a reservation.Props to the service because it was SUPERB! Our server was a Young Hispanic gentleman and he was very friendly and helpful.  Water was filled without you having to ask for it and he gave excellent suggestion in terms of how much food we should order. I just love a place where service is also a priority (not just food)! although he might need some help because he was running around the whole night doing all types of work.We came on a busy Saturday night at around 6:30pmOur family of 5 started with a pitcher of sangria, it was delicious! perfect sweetness, plenty of fruits and best of all, lots of wine.We were also very hungry so we went for the Super Combinacion($35) (whole rotisserie chicken,  with rice & beans, salchipapas, sweet plantains and avocado salad) and then ordered another whole rotisserie chicken ($14) on top. (Server told us it was too much food but we disregarded the warning)The Rotisserie chicken: WOWWERRR talking about a moist, tender, juicy, flavorful chicken.  it took a little bit of time but well worth it.  the chicken was huge and they split the dark/white side so everyone can pick whatever they like.is it better than Pio Pio? I don't know but I can definitely it's at least on par with Pio Pio!Also worth mentioning is the free Yucca Fries they give in the beginning but I think the star of the show is really that light yellow dipping sauce, I have no clue what is in it but make sure you SAVE IT and dip your chicken with it later cause it's THAT GOOD!! Unfortunately the night we went, the rice was a bit undercooked which I find quite strange at a Peruvian restaurant but luckily we were so full from the other food that we didn't really mind. Price: Inexpensive considering how much food they give you.  The super combo is enough to feed at least 3-4 people and it's so worth the $35.Overall: We had an excellent experience at Lima 33- great drinks, superb service  and delicious food! Just get the chicken and make sure to save that Yellow Dipping sauce!!",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",4,0,0.5,12.1999998093,"Lima,chicken,rotisserie,brother,something,something,GOOD,gentleman,priority,Street Parking,something,Little Neck Pkwy,Chicken Lover,neighborhood,dipping sauce,parking,Peruvian,amount,Little Neck,rotisserie chicken,Super Combinacion,Queens,Pio Pio,place,combo,rice,food,clue,server,beans,rotisserie chicken,dishes,food,food,intersection,skirt steak,back,area,circle,TIP,food,service,family,street parking,Server,restaurant,chicken,Seating,rice,seats,chicken,beans,all,rice,lights,wall,art pieces,weekends,Water,terms,suggestion,work.,types,sangria,pitcher,salchipapas,top,plantains,wine.,lots,best,fruits,avocado salad,plenty,sweetness,Northern Blvd,restaurant,help,Props,food,mentioning,show,beginning,service,chicken,Young Hispanic,30pmOur,Dipping sauce,chicken,chicken,food,Yucca Fries,Price,people,experience,drinks,bit,warning,side,everyone,whatever,par,WOWWERRR,Rotisserie","2,7,6,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6","0.0659861564636,0.0650152638555,0.0533753074706,0.0520427934825,0.0467637963593,0.0369724556804,0.0363448821008,0.0337829627097,0.0330535769463,0.025009682402,0.0223312079906,0.0206340011209,0.0177849214524,0.0176298115402,0.0157031044364,0.0143285635859,0.0136494757608,0.0128915496171,0.0119408983737,0.0118104349822,0.0105786593631,0.0105414707214,0.00976659636945,0.00911852996796,0.00877354480326,0.00846558716148,0.00814677868038,0.00779279554263,0.00773254223168,0.00770041672513,0.00720677152276,0.0070879929699,0.00680302036926,0.00679394556209,0.00673775328323,0.00673775328323,0.00670322962105,0.00670322962105,0.00670322962105,0.00670322962105,0.00660867244005,0.00648681493476,0.0063308654353,0.00612060632557,0.00589582696557,0.00568677019328,0.00536373723298,0.00517246825621,0.00516418833286,0.0051623727195,0.00477119255811,0.00469709699973,0.00469709699973,0.00458561908454,0.00452550733462,0.00452550733462,0.00452550733462,0.00451667280868,0.00450230715796,0.00450230715796,0.00450230715796,0.00449629826471,0.00449629826471,0.0041145067662,0.0041145067662,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00410953862593,0.00398947577924,0.00383991422132,0.0038131440524,0.00350512959994,0.00319232023321,0.00305802491494,0.00305802491494,0.00305802491494,0.00303413928486,0.0028122428339,0.00266927853227,0.00266173575073,0.0024126006756,0.00235937372781,0.00235937372781,0.00226841680706,0.00224559823982,0.00211365055293,0.00211211899295,0.00211211899295,0.00211211899295,0.00169959885534,0.00134475086816,0.00134212384,0.00134212384,0.00134212384,0.00134094979148,0.00114974251483,0.00114339974243"

The green sauce is quite good and spicy.The Ceviche De Pescado was outstanding.  The fish melted in your mouth and had a nice punch of lime and a great balance of heat from the peppers.  The dish also included red onion, corn and sweet potato.  This may have been my favorite dish of the night.Anticuchos are marinated and grilled heart beef skewers; which may sound scary if you've never tried it, but it really is delicious.Tacu Tacu Con Carne is skirt steak served with a mixture of beans and rice and was savory and succulent.Arroz Chaufa a Peruvian style fried rice was loaded with chicken and shrimp and seasoned wonderfully.The sides of fried yucca and sweet plantains were amazing and addicting.For dessert the waiter recommended the donuts.  There were 4 large donuts on the order which were crispy and served over a honey sauce. While they were good, they were a bit on the bland side.  The tres leche cake on the other hand was decadent and divine.They also do a great rendition of Happy Birthday.  This is a lovely spot for dinner with some excellent food that will leave you feeling very satisfied.

Was mostly fries, onions and peppers. Not the best but not the worst we've had. My only complaint was the service. Our first waiter, Rodolpho was horrible. He came to our table and instead of a Good Evening and his name, he held his hands out and said, ""What'll you have?"" with an attitude. No introduction or even some info on the specials. Then he avoided us for the next 1/2 hour. Thank goodness a younger waiter, Roberto, took over and he was a delight and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.

The intimacy of this place makes dining in worthwhile. Among the hustle & bustle on Northern Blvd Lima 33 stands out. Our waiter was excellent minus the mishap of not serving us water. That's minor when everything else was on point. He recommended a few specials to us that sounded not only appetizing but intrigued us as well. You're also served complimentary Yucca Fries with a delicious yet spicy green sauce. We settled on the Sangria. After one glass I was feeling it. Perfect combination of sweet and yet also strong. We had a special Peruvian appetizer named, Causa Rellena. It was filled with chicken then drizzled with a spicy yellow & olive sauce. Causa takes its name from the old Incan Quechua word kausaq, which means ""giver of life,"" another name for the potato. Rellena is the Spanish word for ""stuffed"" or ""filled."" For my entree I ordered the Lomo Saltado. My dish consisted of sauteed strips of tenderloin steak with onions, tomatoes, garlic & soy sauce, served with french fries, and white rice. He ordered the Pollo A La Brasa which is a whole rotisserie chicken, marinated in a traditional Peruvian recipe. For sides we ordered the sweet Plantains and extra fried Yucca.

We sat at a half booth with chairs as I love some cushioned under my cute tushy lol. I was so mesmerized by our server Robert as he was telling me about their dinner specials. Anyways back to the food...I know the portions are big and definitely enough for the 3 of us. I ordered two cups of hot water with lime for my parents and iced water with lime for me. Awww what a cute individual kettles. Woooo hooo Yuca Frita was a complimentary dish!I ordered Pollo a la Brasa y Arroz con Mariscos to share for the table. Hubba hubba the Pollo a la Brasa is finger-licking-goodness and the seasoning that they rubbed into the chicken was simply delicious.

Now when it comes to the food, if you never been to a Peruvian restaurant then you are not going to be very judgemental about the food. I eat at Chimu in Brooklyn, Williamsburg and at Flor de Mayo (chinese peruvian) in upper mManhattan and both places have food that is consistent & amazing. Now getting back to Lima 33, the food was just ok, not something I come back for. The ceviche mixto lacked acidity, when I order it we asked for spicy sauce  on the side and the waiter forgot to bring it to the table. the ceviche had a sweet potato, toasted corn and a nice bed of lettuce. The anticucho platter, should have been the most anticilated star of the appetizers but it was not. the cow heart had been sliced and set on to skewers. it was a bit chewy and the earthy presence in the meat itself reminded me that i am eating organ meat. it came with a small side of aioll whuch was mistly mayo and nothing else.  Usually rice and beans is a pretty standard side dish that is simple,tasty and well done. However, the rice was mushy, and the beans had no taste. The side of plantains was worth the $5 as it was a huge pile of sweet plantains. The peruvian style chicken was fine, nothing special. For $14, you get. whole chicken sliced in quarters. I forgot to mention that upon arrival, the table received a small platter of yuca with a garlic aiolli. In my opinion that aiolli had too much mayonnaise and very little garlic and it lacked a little bit of acidity to cut some of the fat. parking was easy, specially after 7pm. our table of 3ppl, git basic service and at one point once the food was drop on the table we never saw the waiter until the bill came.  Ironic that when the waiter presented the bill, the bill had a suggested tip starting at 18%..upto and including 25% suggested tip?ARE YOU KIDDING ME?",2.0 star rating,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,0,0.0,11.8999996185,"side dish,linens,A,department,health,decor,food,food,food,restaurant,side,Peruvian,food,presence,Chimu,mayonnaise,anticucho platter,something,ceviche mixto,places,side,table,side,waiter,rice,ceviche,mayo,acidity,meat,Flor de Mayo,organ meat,beans,aioll whuch,nothing,beans,plantains,tip,sauce,lettuce,bed,corn,sweet potato,appetizers,skewers,cow heart,table,taste,aiolli,mManhattan,Brooklyn,Williamsburg,Lima,garlic aiolli,some,parking,star,food,garlic,bit,acidity,fat,opinion,service,bill,table,bill,waiter,waiter,bill,drop,tip,style chicken,table,pile,platter,plantains,chicken,yuca,arrival","7,6,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,5,1,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4","0.0830064415932,0.0556404851377,0.0556404851377,0.0556404851377,0.0556404851377,0.0556404851377,0.0451279506087,0.0381441675127,0.0381441675127,0.0266303904355,0.0243073217571,0.0198434628546,0.017313927412,0.0171898324043,0.0157236456871,0.014646765776,0.0122179752216,0.010108388029,0.0100798839703,0.00976730976254,0.00920471921563,0.00920471921563,0.00912431348115,0.00855293124914,0.00840744189918,0.00826948136091,0.00826622638851,0.007780124899,0.00772243365645,0.0075510670431,0.00752931227908,0.00750193279237,0.00737385870889,0.00705791031942,0.00704939616844,0.00703449733555,0.00690390495583,0.00680778129026,0.00679207872599,0.00679207872599,0.00679207872599,0.00679207872599,0.00677883066237,0.0067673753947,0.0067673753947,0.00618588831276,0.0061614299193,0.00613155867904,0.00601000664756,0.00601000664756,0.00601000664756,0.00598814338446,0.00575937936082,0.00553903309628,0.0054655498825,0.00546544790268,0.00543190306053,0.00523483660072,0.00523483660072,0.00523483660072,0.00458020484075,0.00458020484075,0.00457409303635,0.00440466450527,0.0042836391367,0.00423771003261,0.00397993996739,0.00397747941315,0.00397747941315,0.00378212914802,0.0036176876165,0.00275125121698,0.0027195957955,0.00240926048718,0.00235709641129,0.00230589834973,0.00229983474128,0.00201048795134,0.00201048795134"

Friday night, it's quiet inside, we're greeted, we sit, sangria please, thank you very much num num num. Waiter seems nice and even puts the napkins over our laps for us, nice touch. After looking at the menu I see that they have their own ""matador"" combo so we order. They gave us complimentary yuca fries with a sauce that has a hint of green coloring and reminds me of tarter sauce (maybe it's just me) taste whatever. The yuca fries weren't as tasty as the presentation fooled me to believe but then comes the food, mmm delicous. A whole chicken, sweet plantain, rice and beans, a jumbo avocado salad and salchipapa. The flavors were very good and even tho at times I was thinking of the pio pio green sauce it didn't hurt the meal not to have it.  NOW This is where it all went downhill. As we ate more people started coming in for dinner and the service became very very lacking. 1 waiter and 1 bus boy for the entire place running around not paying mind to us anymore. Eventually we got the waiters attention, ordered dessert and 20min later I found myself grabbing his attention for the check because we were tired of waiting for it. He dropped the check off with his head down not saying a word and the dessert crossed off the bill.

While I  don't claim to be a connoisseur of Peruvian cuisine, many Peruvian restaurants in New York City and Long Island have come and gone in my life time, and think I have eaten at most of them. I've also been to Peru many times over the years and have eaten at many of the great restaurants in and around Lima. Any time a new Peruvian restaurant opens up in New York; I always like to go there to sample the fare in search for the quintessential freshness and flavors that I expect to find in a great Peruvian restaurant. Having said that, I recently came across Lima 33 on Northern Boulevard in the Douglaston/Little Neck area of Queens, and I just had to try it out. Simply put, this place is the real deal. My first and subsequent visits here have been totally delightful and satisfying. The freshness and quality of ingredients are impressive due to a well planned menu. Meals are prepared and presented expertly and the flavors are delicious. Many will claim what I am about to say is sacrilege but the rotisserie chickens are just as good, if not better, than those served at that famous Peruvian restaurant located several miles down the road from us. The staff is accommodating and courteous and the Chef actually came to our table and asked if everything was to our satisfaction. I have returned here often since my first time and often take their food to go. There is no doubt experienced Peruvian diners will appreciate this restaurant as much as I do, and first time diners will surely become hooked.

It had fish filet, calamari, mussels, octopus, and came with fried yucca but I asked for sweet plantains instead.... It was quite tasty but I felt that it there had to be a better way to keep them crunchier longer.... The breading started to come off the fried seafood due to it getting soggy....

It sounded a lot like Pio Pio - similar offerings, so we were willing to give it a try. First off, they do have their liquor license now, so you don't need to BYOB. Their sangria is pretty good. We were seated in the main dining area (there is another dining area off to the side) for our party of 4. We ordered the Cebiche Mixto, and the Super Combination for dinner. The ceviche was awesome, I liked it a lot. The Super Combination consisted of a whole roast chicken, sweet plaintains, avocado salad, fries and hot dogs, and one order of rice and beans. We ordered a 2nd helping of rice and beans, but other than that, it was more than enough to feed the 4 of us.The food definitely speaks for itself. The service was not that great. I think it was just our server because we would ask him for things and he wouldnt bring them, but if we asked anyone else, they would bring us extra sauce or fill our water glasses right away. For me, I think I still like Pio Pio better - although Lima's green sauce is better. Both restaurants are about the same distance away from where I live so, it's a toss up.

Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,7858,"Picked up some food from Lima 33 last night for a nice Sunday night dinner with the family.Just happened to be browising Yelp and this new Peruvian joint popped up.I immediately thought of Pio Pio in the city when I was looking at their menu (which can be found on their facebook page btw), so I decided it's time to give them a shot.I will say -- unfortunately it looks like majority of the reviews for Lima 33 are indeed fake fillers. However -- I'm not sure why they feel they needed to take the dirty route on Yelp because they could just let their cooking speak for it self.The skirt steak with the Tacu Tacu con Carne was pretty good -- although they were a bit skimpy on the skirt steak - it had great flavor (just a little too well-done for my taste). Everyone else in my family loved it.We also had Arroz con Mariscos, which is basically the Peruvian paella - spice laden rice with a ton of seafood. It was great, and perhaps the best dish of the night. Just the correct amount of spice - big lumpy pieces of various seafood -- muscles, calamari, shrimps; it was also very nice and moist, no dry rice or seafood here.Lastly we had the Super Combination -- which includes rotisserie chicken with a bit of a variation in the sauce that I'm not used to.Either it's Pio Pio in the city or any other Peruvian restaurant I have been do, they always serve an Aji Amarillo Cilantro sauce with the rotisserie chicken, one of my favorite sauces in the world, however Lima 33 tried creating their own concoction to be used as a staple sauce for their chicken.It's a creamy light yellow sauce that packs a considerable punch in the heat department, I believe it does have some cilantro init, but instead of a mayo base they use a mustard base. It was good, although I do prefer the more traditional green cilantro sauce.I can't give Lima 33 five stars just yet because I can't say every dish blew me away, however, everything was certainly flavorful, nothing was bland (except maybe the sweet fried plantains and the Peruvian sausage and french fries).I will certainly use Lima 33 again and report back.All in all - solid and pretty much the only Peruvian restaurant in the immediate area.BTW -- excellent ambiance in the restaurant while I was there, and immaculately clean -- always a plus in my book. Part of the kitchen is built into the dining area so you can see a good portion of their chef cooking.",4.0 star rating,"Island Park, NY",3,0,0.5,5.5,"Lima,Peruvian,up.,menu,family.,city,dinner,joint,food,facebook page,Yelp,skirt steak,Arroz con Mariscos,sauces,fillers,Pio Pio,Super Combination,reviews,majority,variation,shot.,route,Everyone,cooking,sauce,sauce,seafood,seafood,seafood,dish,rice,skirt steak,family,restaurant,rotisserie chicken,rotisserie chicken,city,bit,flavor,taste,ton,calamari,shrimps,pieces,amount,muscles,everything,one,world,cilantro,nothing,dish,french fries,sausage,plantains,Aji Amarillo Cilantro,Tacu Tacu con Carne,restaurant,restaurant,area.,dining area,chef cooking,portion,stars,ambiance,plus,book,Part,kitchen,sauce,sauce,chicken.,mustard base,mayo base,cilantro init,heat department,punch,concoction","2,2,7,7,1,2,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,1,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,3,7,7","0.300949215889,0.109327591956,0.102249845862,0.0601519420743,0.0273816995323,0.0273816995323,0.0239920187742,0.0239920187742,0.0239920187742,0.0239920187742,0.0213426612318,0.0190540626645,0.01620769687,0.0143624693155,0.013969194144,0.0104455342516,0.00966921448708,0.00921073649079,0.00864681787789,0.00681721186265,0.0065471213311,0.00510296085849,0.00504749361426,0.00500964792445,0.00425546523184,0.00404526619241,0.00370021117851,0.00367634580471,0.00367634580471,0.00357274524868,0.00356266042218,0.00338303809986,0.00336570478976,0.0033643792849,0.0033643792849,0.0033643792849,0.00306018884294,0.00306018884294,0.00296004675329,0.00296004675329,0.00294487760402,0.00292587722652,0.00292587722652,0.00292587722652,0.00292587722652,0.00292587722652,0.00272405263968,0.00267751328647,0.00267751328647,0.00250800326467,0.00238336366601,0.00228115892969,0.00199580914341,0.00199580914341,0.00199580914341,0.00199210969731,0.00175256084185,0.00173649704084,0.00173649704084,0.00157938199118,0.00157629803289,0.00157629803289,0.00143253454007,0.00141725165304,0.0013817603467,0.0013817603467,0.0013817603467,0.00137906195596,0.00137906195596,0.00132604129612,0.00132604129612,0.00110260816291,0.00100281916093,0.00100281916093,0.000877310638316,0.000877310638316,0.000877310638316,0.000877310638316"

We were most impressed with the appetizers and if I could have eaten just that, I probably would have.    The ceviche de pescado was fresh and divine... very much like what I had in Lima and Cusco.   The lipsmacking goodness was as addicting as it should be. The tamal was fluffy (how did he do that... steamed instead of boiled??) and had a great flavor.  Inside of ours, we found pork, egg and olives... mmm!  The chef mentioned it was his grandmother's recipe.  The mains were not as impressive as the apps but still very enjoyable.  It's hard to describe but the seasoning didn't blow our socks off. My lomo saltado was very tender.  My husband's entree of tilapia was good enough and satisfied his large appetite.  The rotisserie chicken met rave reviews.  The seafood soup was more like gravy than soup, but had ample chunks of calamari and mussels.   So in this case, maybe I would have knocked off half a star... but Yelp doesn't do halves...The sides were cheap and HUGE! $5 of sweet plantains granted the table a heaping dish.  The salchipapas was essentially deep fried hot dogs and french fries... the casualness didn't match the grandeur of the other dishes but it was so fun to eat... so who cares?  Again, it was enough to serve the whole table sides.I almost forgot to mention that they served fried yucca with this great green sauce instead of a free bread basket.... LOVED THAT!Dessert was a caramel pudding and a flan.  Both done very nicely.  My glass of wine came full to the top... it was like $8 for two glasses really...!Service was great.  Our waiter was attentive.  We were greeted by the main chef.  Others pitched in so that the food would always come right as it was ready.  We also hung out for a very long time after eating to chat... but they never pushed us out since no one was waiting nor was it closing time yet.  Thankfully.  So no complaints there!",5.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,16.5,"goodness,food,recipe,pescado,appetizers,chef,husband,Peruvian,food,casualness,tamal,dish,flavor,restaurant,seafood soup,Others,lomo saltado,entree,grandmother,appetite,soup,halves,salchipapas,table,grandeur,olives,egg,pork,apps,socks,seasoning,tilapia,rotisserie chicken,rave reviews,mussels,calamari,chunks,gravy,case,dogs,plantains,french fries,Cusco,Lima,star,glass,Service,waiter,glasses,chef,caramel pudding,flan,wine,Yelp,no one,complaints,sides,mains,table sides.,dishes,bread basket,green sauce,yucca,Dessert","7,7,5,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,2,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.0640182048082,0.0621054396033,0.0613842755556,0.0540515035391,0.0518966130912,0.0337256230414,0.0294082891196,0.0272137280554,0.02526954934,0.0233567822725,0.0205984450877,0.0197642892599,0.0172554533929,0.016906702891,0.0157504770905,0.0151326656342,0.0138168456033,0.0138047831133,0.013265456073,0.0132134659216,0.0131925437599,0.0130928270519,0.0125961899757,0.0120647959411,0.0120565379038,0.0116372704506,0.0116372704506,0.0116372704506,0.0115949483588,0.0115832006559,0.0115832006559,0.0115622272715,0.0115527808666,0.0115527808666,0.0115439146757,0.0115439146757,0.0115439146757,0.0115439146757,0.0115355607122,0.0112393377349,0.010556849651,0.0105496216565,0.0102599728853,0.0102599728853,0.010035270825,0.00994629412889,0.00939012132585,0.00938505958766,0.00898761954159,0.00897813029587,0.00838780496269,0.00787284784019,0.00786377675831,0.00625134631991,0.0054338988848,0.00542897824198,0.00522763468325,0.00502382824197,0.00415535923094,0.00395241845399,0.00345558277331,0.00345558277331,0.00345558277331,0.003453445388"

Everybody knows that Mother's Day is the busiest day of the year, and my boyfriend and I having worked in the industry, completely understood. They came back about 30 minutes later after making the ceviche on the spot and we were more than pleased. This is a perfect example of a restaurant going above and beyond and maintaining quality service despite circumstances. Besides the service, the food was excellent.

Lima 33 Restaurant,5547,254-04 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,198678,"Went here last night and thought it was amazing and will only get better when they get their liquor license. For now though, I thought it was great that they let you bring your own wine and there is no uncorking fee. Hopefully their drinks will expand (sangrias and what not).First, I need to say my point of reference (like many) for Peruvian food is Pio Pio, both of which I had in Jackson Heights and the city. Lima 33, is on par (if not better) than Pio Pio due to the variant in the sauces (I love both places Green sauces-- so it's very subjective and I'll let you decide). To start, I had the Salchipapas (fries with the sausage?) and Anti-cuchos (beef skewers). The beef was made perfectly it was soft and tasted great (hint of sweetness). The Salchipapas were good too. Usually the fries are the downfall, but these were quite good and the meat pieces were not over cooked and not too salty. If a restaurant pays this much attention to side orders-- I was just imagining how awesome the entrees were going to be. Which brings me to the piece la resistance. We ordered the Combinacion Limena, which is a whole chicken, fries, and avocado salad. As Dave Chapelle says... THE CHICKEN. My goodness that chicken. This is the staple of a good Peruvian place and the good news is, the chicken was amazing. I don't care if you like dark or white meat, the whole thing was awesome. The seasoning was great and the chicken was moist in its entirety. Dip it in the green sauce or the red and the flavors just explode in your mouth (I have a high tolerance for spicy things so please try at your own risk). I didn't eat the salad that came with the chicken, but it looked appetizing and my friends are it. Overall, chicken was Pio Pio level if not better.We also had the Arroz con Mariscos (essentially Paella). I don't usually eat seafood dishes, but this was great. The rice, sauce, and all components just worked. The flavors didn't over power the chicken which to me was very important. In case you hadn't guessed, I was happy with my meal and for the amount and quality of food, the price was just right (quite a good deal-- but this is also subjective).

Lima Mill Basin,5548,6620 Avenue U,Brooklyn,11234.0,198401,"We trecked to Brooklyn to take part in a giant water slide at the Aviator Sports Complex. It was a cold and rainy day and all we could think about was a warm meal. I looked on Yelp for anything that was nearby and would be delicious. I found this place and thought it would work for our party of 5. Upon arriving my hopes quickly went down. This restaurant was located in a shopping center which I'm not a fan of but it was getting late and we were restless and HUNGRY. I am the only Spanish person in my group and although I'm not Peruvian, I am familiar with the cuisine and have eaten it many times before. After ordering pitchers of red sangria, my friends asked for my suggestions and I gave my thoughts. We also asked the waitress and she mentioned a few of the ones I had also picked. Oddly enough when the waitress was talking I realized she could barely pronounce the items on the menu. Maybe she just didn't speak Spanish it wasn't Spanish at all? Either way that doesn't matter just something I noticed. As we waited for our food and drinks, the waitress brought over some toasted hominy corn with a spicy green sauce. This was so good! I could have eaten the whole bowl by myself. I enjoyed this treat a lot more than just the usual bread brought to tables. The sangria that finally came was weak. Flavor was lacking and it tasted more like juice with fruit. Service was extremely slow despite the fact that we were the only ones there. Appetizers:Lima empanadas: filled with spinach, corn, manchengo cheese and figs: these were delicious. The flavors all complimented each other and was a hit with everyone. Papa a la huancaina: boiled potatoes in spicy creamy sauce: a Peruvian staple. They tasted OK. I had asked if they could make Yucca a la huancaina which I prefer, but was told they could not even though yucca is offered on the menu...Manchengo croquettes: another hit with our group. Cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crunch and cheesiness. Chaufa: fried rice with shrimp. Another popular Peruvian dish. It did not have the presentation I normally see at Peruvian restaurants. The color looked pale (it usually has a brownish color) and as an experienced rice eater (hey I grew up on this stuff!), I could immediately tell I was eating minute rice. Absolutely not acceptable at all. Lamb chops: my Canadian friend had these and she loved it. Lomo Salteado: beef tenderloin chunks sautéed with onions and peppers: again a popular Peruvian dish which I absolute love but the flavors were lacking here. The chefs need to be retrained in cooking Peruvian good and the service needs to improve. For the amount of time we waited for our food, I could have quickly forgiven them had our food been excellent but sadly it just wasn't.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.0,17.8999996185,"person,meal,food,anything,part,water slide,Peruvian,waitress,hopes,Aviator Sports Complex,Brooklyn,party,place,sangria,shopping center,waitress,Flavor,friend,way,Yelp,color,huancaina,restaurant,times,group,red sangria,Spanish,ones,hominy corn,fan,cuisine,pitchers,dish,friends,Service,ones,menu,flavors,green sauce,hit,manchengo cheese,corn,sauce,huancaina,suggestions,thoughts,Appetizers,few,items,something,drinks,bowl,lot,bread,tables,treat,each other,juice,fruit,fact,empanadas,figs,spinach,everyone,Papa,staple,potatoes,waitress,rice,restaurants,color,presentation,stuff,rice eater,Chaufa,flavors,yucca,Lima,service,amount,love,peppers,onions,beef tenderloin chunks,good,chefs,Lamb,Canadian,Lomo Salteado,menu,hit,la,group,amount,cheesiness,dish,croquettes,crunch,shrimp,Yucca,Manchengo","1,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,2,2,3,7,7,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,1,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,6,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,5,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7","0.298382341862,0.0655621439219,0.059260442853,0.0406327918172,0.0376103296876,0.0283344779164,0.0277417395264,0.0272710062563,0.0171993356198,0.0168254412711,0.0168254412711,0.0153063377365,0.0133976452053,0.0130468290299,0.0129645345733,0.0119594428688,0.0108508104458,0.0107112750411,0.00868297647685,0.00796998199075,0.00761774089187,0.00676505081356,0.00582197867334,0.00581062212586,0.00581062212586,0.00580080226064,0.00546347768977,0.00540643045679,0.00514401542023,0.00509414821863,0.00508420914412,0.0050756148994,0.00464254571125,0.00461796065792,0.00423320755363,0.0039106993936,0.00390548096038,0.00389252393506,0.00389251601882,0.00377208902501,0.00354264187627,0.00354264187627,0.00353836454451,0.00353836454451,0.00342667056248,0.00342667056248,0.00342185422778,0.00342155830003,0.00341699179262,0.00340910395607,0.00340564688668,0.00339947477914,0.00339669478126,0.00339669478126,0.00339669478126,0.00335391005501,0.00334236887284,0.00310363573954,0.00310363573954,0.00310150906444,0.00309949298389,0.00309949298389,0.00309949298389,0.00309757655486,0.00309575046413,0.00309575046413,0.00309575046413,0.0028526079841,0.00282373768277,0.00263539096341,0.00263421866111,0.00230565085076,0.00230462523177,0.00230462523177,0.00228135194629,0.00200262456201,0.0019725789316,0.00183478242252,0.00182068534195,0.00181999616325,0.00159345380962,0.00159345380962,0.00159345380962,0.00159345380962,0.00159283203539,0.00159283203539,0.00136296323035,0.00136296323035,0.00136241444852,0.00115795002785,0.00115795002785,0.00115795002785,0.00115795002785,0.00115735060535,0.00115735060535,0.00115622126032,0.00110707455315,0.00101248617284,0.00101198256016,0.000685297942255,0.000685297942255"

My boyfriend and I hadn't meant to come here - we were going to hit up the sushi spot a few doors down when we decided on a whim to try this place instead. Glad we did! Everyone was so friendly and enthusiastic that we immediately felt welcome. We unfortunately couldn't stay and had to take our meal to go, but the ceviche mixto and the rotisserie chicken we ordered were PERFECT. My boyfriend and I were 'oohing' and 'aahing' all the way through the meal, and decided we definitely would be back. Fast forward a few weeks and we returned to have a sit-down meal there. Food was amazing again. Bit of a snafu with an ingredient I'd asked not to have in the dish, but the waiter realized without me even telling him when the dish was brought out. He apologized profusely and had them to do a quick remake, and all was well! Food was every bit as good as the first time we visited, and the service was warm, friendly, and prompt. Portions are good too - thought I'd explode! =)I'm a little cheap, so to me to food's a little pricier than I'd normally do, but still relatively inexpensive, and you're getting really great food.

The food here is EXCELLENT and there's absolutely nothing like it by Mill Basin/Marine Park.We had manchego croquettes (which were just fried cheese balls), empanadas, perfectly cooked tostones, salchipapas, and the delicious ceviche mixto. The ceviche was citrusy and light and not too spicy like we asked. We also shared the chaufa with chicken and shrimp which was a nice simple fried rice dish. The dishes came with a few different sauces that were also great: a spicy cilantro sauce, chipotle mayo, and a garlic sauce.The food alone would give it 5 stars, but I have to knock off a star because the service was very slow. We shared multiple appetizers instead of having individual entrees and would've been happy to receive a few at a time like we normally do at other places. Instead, we waited a long time to get it all at once. There were only 2 or 3 other tables when we went but we sat there with dessert menus for about 10 minutes before our server came back.I also could not bring myself to order a $12 dessert.

The menu isn't as large as the typical Peruvian restaurant you might find in Queens, but the quality is superior. Standards like papa a la huancaina, jalea, and chaufa were all fresh, well prepared, and appropriately portioned. The churrasco was also very tasty with a nice grilled flavor. The complementary sangria was delicious and the yuca frita had the right amount of crispiness. The aji verde (Peruvian green sauce) was outstanding...easily the best I have ever tasted in various Peruvian restaurants in New York and Lima. Also, if you like very spicy food, the rocoto puree packs both heat and flavor (ask for it!). In addition to delicious food, the service at Lima was very friendly and prompt, and the ambiance was tasteful and comfortable. The only word of caution is the price, which is a tad on the expensive side, especially for Peruvian food, which can often be very cheap. However, the quality of the food justifies the cost, although it could limit the frequency with which one dines at Lima.

You just maybe pleasantly surprised that you did. I went with my sister today and enjoyed a wonderful late lunch.  The daily lunch special runs to 4PM.  We opted for the full menu.  I started with the Ceviche Maximo, their are a few Ceviches to choose from on the menu.  Unlike Pio Pio (which can be a little heavy handed with the salt), Lima's Ceviche was served chilled, in a flavorful sauce with red onion slices. I could actually taste the difference between the variety of seafood. My sister ordered the green mussels which disappeared in seconds as she grinned from ear to ear.  If we were at her place, I have no doubt my sister would have poured the extra sauce into a glass and drink it.  It was that good, so says she.We split a whole rotisserie chicken with mixed vegetables, sautéed spinach, mashed potatoes and tostadas.  Note to all, Lima makes two types of garlic sauce, I like the one served with the tostadas. It was thicker than the chicken garlic sauce.  Try pouring some sauce on the mash potatoes.  As mentioned before, you can actually taste the food which was very tasty. For dessert we ordered the flan and chocolate lava cake.  A wonderful ending to a great afternoon with my sister.A special thank you to Christina for being a terrific hostess and server.  Her attention to detail and knowledge of the menu was outstanding.  If I could make one suggestion, switch from bottled iced tea to brewing tea and serving chill, my I take the liberty to suggest green tea with cinnamon and cloves.

So, everything  from the quality of food to the customer service is top notch. We've had the empanadas, the rotisserie chicken, the salchipapa, the skirt steak, manchego croquettes, calamari, Jalea, skirt steak (churrasco) and the pollo saltado. They are all delicious! I can't even begin to tell you about their delicious sangrias....all you need is one and you're feeling nice!  As far as customer service, you couldn't ask for anything better. EVERYONE is great....Carlos(the owner), John(the owners son) and Maria(the hostess).

Good sized portion.  Fried just crispy enough, reminds me a little of an onion ring crunch.  Not dry, or mushy like some others I've had.Whole rotisserie chicken cut into quarters for us.  Juicy, moist and succulent.  Doesn't taste like it was mass ordered from Costco;  don't get me wrong Costco chicken is delicious, but you don't want to come to eat at a Peruvian restaurant seasoned with Peruvian spices to have it taste like something you'd get from costco.  Sides comes with salad (freshly sliced tomatoes, cucumber, sliced avocado, carrots, celery, red cabbage, few other things with a homemade salad dressing almost like a light Italian), rice and beans, fried plantains, roasted corn kernels, fries&sausage, and that bomb green sauce (flavorful & packs a decent kick; apparently there was something spicier but we dared not to try it).Overall, great place to find.  Will definitely come back again.  The owner is very accommodating, very welcoming, food is great, drinks are worth every dollar.  Only complaint I would have is the music is very loud.  I left shouting still, but that could be the sangria working ;).",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.5,10.5,"justice,yelper,guys,review,yelp,mass,bomb green sauce,Sangria,Sangria,sangria,glass,owner,glass,door.,son,combo,fried calamari app,pineapples,oranges,apples,sangria,chicken,Peruvian,owner,plate,Fried calamari,little,place,something,goodness,portion,crispy,onion ring crunch,others,rotisserie chicken cut,quarters,Both,restaurant,spices,sangria,Costco,owner,kick,fries&sausage,corn kernels,Juicy,food,music,complaint,dollar,drinks,Sides,salad,plantains,beans,rice,salad dressing,things,red cabbage,celery,carrots,avocado,cucumber,tomatoes,Italian","7,1,1,5,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,3,1,4,7,7,3,7,5,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.0972487553954,0.0897587686777,0.0787280201912,0.0787280201912,0.0430988818407,0.0359138995409,0.0280082952231,0.0275101363659,0.027432853356,0.0206553991884,0.0182701051235,0.0180801674724,0.0163897071034,0.0143967857584,0.0143967857584,0.0143967857584,0.0143967857584,0.0143040819094,0.0143040819094,0.0143040819094,0.0138381579891,0.0128731001168,0.0128713930026,0.0121104437858,0.0119315767661,0.0109952623025,0.0109603451565,0.0108348596841,0.00999452918768,0.00962168443948,0.00960543192923,0.0095911193639,0.0095911193639,0.0095783341676,0.0095783341676,0.0095783341676,0.00903145316988,0.00874570943415,0.00874570943415,0.00792466755956,0.00733944121748,0.00694505916908,0.00652879429981,0.00652879429981,0.00652879429981,0.00566619867459,0.00552722113207,0.00552270235494,0.00552270235494,0.00451271887869,0.00423557916656,0.00383403734304,0.00327386683784,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00286423019134,0.00169533141889"

I went in tonight for dinner, my fiancee's family has ordered from this place since it opened & loved the food so I wanted to give it try. I ordered my food which wasn't a problem & after that I was invisible! The only people there were a table of loud guidos & a girl who obviously worked there. The waitress has her full attention with the guido table of 3, I pretty much did not exist.... She went by their table asked if they needed anything at least 4 times yet never paid no mind to me at all until I finally got her attention & asked her for a side guacamole. During the time waiting for the guacamole my fiancée called me & I complained in a low voice about the service, he told me not to leave a tip but I was a server at one time so I told him I couldn't do that, I saw the girl in the corner with her laptop looking over so at that point I knew she worked there or was a friend... Once the waitress finally passed my table (again only two tables were in use) I told her I wanted it to go, she said my guacamole I ordered over 20 minutes ago was on its way so I said I want it all to go....another 20/25 min later my food appeared in a bag but at this point I already knew the girl sitting there not drinking the half glass of wine that sat there for a half hour not touched worked there I accepted the bag of food but left it there because GOD only knows what was in there...

Lima Restaurant & Bar,5549,85-07 Northern Blvd,Jackson Heights,11372.0,6131,"Lima R&B caters to upscale diners in Jackson Heights. There's many Peruvian restaurants in the area: I counted three within 2 blocks.  This is the most upscale of the lot.  Visually, it's chic and dark.  Somewhat nightclubish.  The waiters are uniformed in crisp uniforms, and the price point is adjusted upwards, according: It's one of the most expensive restaurants in the vicinity.We came here twice.  It was empty at 3pm (understandable, it's an odd time for a restaurant) and was sparse at noon, although the restaurant had a good lunch crowd by 1pm.  I'd think they don't do much lunch business anyhow.  I envision this place hopping and crowded at night.The first time we came, service was inattentive.  Second time it was perfect.  Our waiter seemed a little nervous, but maybe I was asking too many questions.  His English wasn't as good as my Spanish, so we communicated in Spanish, which is great, since I need the practice, but if you don't speak Spanish, this might be an issue.We spoke with the owner, and his wonderful parents. They are all lovely people who ""worked the crowds"", making sure everyone was fully happy and satisfied.  They take great pride in the restaurant, and it shows. The father is wonderfully friendly and jovial, and a delight to speak to (again, good Spanish practice!).  The mother is a warm and friendly person, and the mastermind behind the dishes. The waiters and busboys are all friendly and good-natured, too.One odd thing is that not every dish is on the menu, but the owner said he's working on that.  On to the food reviews.Cancha: AServed toasted, warm, and fresh.  When you eat cancha, this is what you want!Aji Amarillo Salsa: C-The pepper tasted like habañero, which is too strong for cancha dipping, and not flavorful enough, given its spice level.  It overpowers the food.Chupe de Camarones Sopa: B+The soup is flavorful, yet uncomplicated.  Creamy, yet not heavy.  The shrimp were impressively large, and I couldn't detect the tell-tale iodine flavor of southeast Asian shrimp.  It's hard to believe, but I wonder if Lima R&B uses expensive high-quality Gulf shrimp.Seco de Cabrito: B-The lamb was so tender that I used my fork to cut it.  The lamb is also succulent: it tastes very ""lamby""... no mistaking it for beef, which means it's high quality meat.  The whole stew is surrounded by a bed of bean stew.  The whole dish would've been an A- or even A, except for the fact that my seco hardly had any salsa de seco.  I asked the waiter for more salsa de seco and was refused.Chaufa de Pollo: A+We spent over a month in Peru, and this chaufa is better than any chaufa we've had in Peru or the US.  Simply, it's the best chaufa we've ever had, period.  Cooked with just the right amount of soy sauce -- it tasted of soy, but not overly salty, which chaufa often is.  The chicken is very soft.  What's more, we distinctly tasted ginger in the dish!   Yes, ginger!  I can't even detect ginger in Chinese fried rice these days.  Wow!  I think all the chefs in Lima should all come to Queens to learn how to cook chaufa from the owner's mom!Tallarines Verdes de Entraña: AImpressive dish!  The skirt steak bursts with flavor and was cooked perfectly, despite the waiter not asking us how the steak should be cooked.  The spaghetti was delicious -- it was cooked to softness and the pesto was fresh and vibrant.  Next time we come, the spaghetti is perfect for our 1yr old daughter.Lomo Saltado: A+I have a confession to make.  I never liked lomo saltado -- it seemed like a lazy dish.  You cut up some steak, toss in some french fries and onions, and boom.  Invariably, the fries are freezer burned, and the steak is tough and rubbery.The owner of Lima R&B invited us to try the lomo saltado, boy are we glad we did!  We spent 4+ weeks in Peru, and had lomo saltado countless times both in Peru and the US, and this is the BEST lomo saltado we've ever had, in any country.  Here's the magic: First, there's an actual sauce that gets soaked up by the french fries.  Most other lomo saltados I've had were dry.  Second, the french fries, while obviously still frozen fries, aren't old and freezer burned.  Third, the steak used is soft and juicy skirt steak.  Skirt steak is one of the softest, tastiest cuts of meat.  Every other lomo saltado I've had has rubbery, tasteless meat.For the rest of my life, whenever I eat lomo saltado, I will be comparing it to Lima Bar and Restaurant!Pescado a lo Macho: A-This is ""fish for a manly man!""   The cream sauce was just a tad bland.  I would've liked maybe a bit of garlic or pepper for flavoring.  Two things really stand out: The fish (batter fried sea bass/corvina) is magnificent.  Also, the shrimp is high quality: I didn't detect iodine, which may indicate high quality Gulf shrimp.Picarones: A-A very yeasty doughnut with caramel sauce. If you like dark beer, you'll love this. Goes great with coffee.  They should consider serving espresso to go with these!",5.0 star rating,"Bayside, NY",6,0,0.20000000298,33.9000015259,"price point,upscale,time,people,skirt steak,Spanish,waiter,diners,restaurants,restaurant,Peru,restaurants,restaurant,beef,waiters,mother,Jackson Heights,lunch business,Aji Amarillo Salsa,lunch crowd,blocks,area,lot,vicinity.,uniforms,place,Lima R&B,lamb,pride,quality,owner,fork,habañero,amount,dipping,dish,Peruvian,restaurant,sauce,Chupe de Camarones Sopa,time,owner,dish,issue.,father,service,everyone,crowds,practice,Tallarines Verdes de Entraña,chaufa,Macho: A-This,Gulf,waiter,chaufa,dishes,questions,parents,delight,practice,thing,dish,lamb,iodine,shrimp,waiters,chaufa,chaufa,tell-tale iodine flavor,salsa,salsa,soy sauce,owner,soup,lomo saltado,chefs,seco,pepper,ginger,ginger,ginger,bean stew,stew,seco,chicken,rest,US,English,Picarones,seco,soy,more,lomo,mastermind,menu,busboys,food,spice level,mistaking,bed,fact,times,french fries,fries,french fries,fried rice,Lima,meat,lomo saltado,magic,freezer,cream sauce,lomo saltado,Restaurant,lomo saltado,Cancha,boy,country,cuts,fish,caramel sauce,AServed,Creamy,Asian,Seco de Cabrito: B,flavoring,shrimp,steak,steak,Chaufa de Pollo,Chinese,Queens,pepper,things,espresso,bit,beer,steak,life,man,garlic,sea bass,corvina,coffee,lomo saltado,dish,dish,saltados,waiter,french fries,spaghetti,spaghetti,owner,fries,flavor,pesto,skirt steak bursts,softness,confession,daughter.,boom,onions,Pescado,Lima Bar,A-A,Lomo Saltado,AImpressive","7,7,7,1,7,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,1,2,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,1,3,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,6,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,2,7,1,7","0.0720508098602,0.0613636523485,0.0607811994851,0.052229937166,0.0389977842569,0.0272419322282,0.025360815227,0.021414577961,0.0187203064561,0.0168668329716,0.0159362219274,0.0158648900688,0.0158340092748,0.015652904287,0.0135491928086,0.0131476698443,0.0126991625875,0.0124244410545,0.0120546612889,0.0114690512419,0.0101970126852,0.0101970126852,0.0101448157802,0.0100562004372,0.0100562004372,0.0100047215819,0.0093148611486,0.00908318534493,0.00908282957971,0.00829700008035,0.00827352423221,0.00826035067439,0.0079716835171,0.00777016580105,0.00650931056589,0.00606465013698,0.00604013819247,0.00599806010723,0.00595566025004,0.00575170759112,0.0054863258265,0.00514765735716,0.00473459484056,0.00466174026951,0.00464857416227,0.00456165708601,0.00454044528306,0.00434573926032,0.00433786399662,0.00421177130193,0.00409204140306,0.00409032031894,0.00400540232658,0.00398960104212,0.00388799305074,0.00386845669709,0.00381019175984,0.0038059912622,0.0037952400744,0.00368922692724,0.00358101422898,0.0035089829471,0.00347800180316,0.00347670260817,0.00344840507023,0.00344832590781,0.00334078492597,0.00333015690558,0.00320385280065,0.00319554470479,0.00319407158531,0.00314316037111,0.00313590280712,0.00312654231675,0.00311371451244,0.00310332770459,0.00309663685039,0.0029193891678,0.00291785108857,0.00291671277955,0.00291560892947,0.0029078014195,0.0029078014195,0.0029064102564,0.00284514273517,0.00272459723055,0.00269692623988,0.00269070104696,0.00268918229267,0.00265832338482,0.00265599880368,0.00265382602811,0.00261006620713,0.00255966256373,0.00255769537762,0.00255769537762,0.00255584227853,0.00255409046076,0.00254521728493,0.00254395185038,0.00254273461178,0.00248215626925,0.00248143286444,0.0024800344836,0.00232766382396,0.00231995340437,0.00226448359899,0.00216851127334,0.00214357906953,0.00201128306799,0.00197332282551,0.00192873703782,0.00190256151836,0.00188616767991,0.00180491467472,0.00172919931356,0.00172834668774,0.00172783085145,0.0017254218692,0.00167076417711,0.00161374581512,0.00151277158875,0.00150981650222,0.00150892592501,0.00150807539467,0.00149998650886,0.00149320031051,0.00146642443724,0.00144838378765,0.00137650512625,0.00137311918661,0.00137212406844,0.00136421539355,0.00136387941893,0.00125408638269,0.00122412166093,0.00122323434334,0.00119898782577,0.00119406159502,0.00119406159502,0.00119345576968,0.00119316182099,0.00119316182099,0.00119231326971,0.00117564667016,0.00114772783127,0.00114619487431,0.00113005703315,0.00109045417048,0.00108903506771,0.00106213206891,0.00103586458135,0.00102516298648,0.00102179194801,0.000953953363933,0.000906195666175,0.000758986687288,0.000758729933295,0.000758479931392,0.000758479931392,0.000757998845074,0.000757998845074,0.000706653401721,0.000706653401721,0.000705950253177,0.000678540149238,0.000449309707619"

Lincoln Station,5556,409 Lincoln Pl,Brooklyn,11238.0,130585,"I like Lincoln Station a lot. I spend a lot of money there. They see me often. It's near the train, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Botanical Gardens. Great place to have a meeting, do work, eat brunch, grab a snack, have dinner, get takeout. LS serves so many purposes and is an all around great joint. Here are things I love about it (reasons for the 4 stars): 1. The braised kale sandwich. Where the hell else are you going to get a sandwich filled to the gills with kale? That's right. Nowhere. And with the fava bean spread and focaccia this is perhaps the best sandwich I've ever had. 2. Iced Americanos. Perfection every time. 3. $3 Beer. 4. Computer users have to sit at the communal table. And I do so for some of my own work. There are plugs at each seat and coat hooks under the table. Keeps home-workers away from choice window seating. Totally logical. 5. Lots of veggie salad options. The fact is there are just too few cafes that have non-bread-based options. I'm not vegan, not even gluten-free, but I like to get in my 4-6 servings of veggies a day and don't always like to cook. These are great for a snack or a meal. 6. Friendly register people. 7. The soups are bangin'. And to keep it real here are a few criticisms in case the owners/managers read all of the reviews (why it is not 5 stars): 1. French fries are over-cooked. Lighten up dudes! Fries don't gotta be so crispy. Also please cut them a little bigger. 2. Bfast sandwich is good but could use some tweaking/is sometimes too greasy. Maybe add something crunchy like lettuce or tomato. Lighten up on what seems to be mayonnaise-based red sauce. 3. Fried chicken usually too salty/has been brined too long--this is also the case with the chicken at the sister restaurant, Bar Corvo. Brining is good, but not to be overdone.

They offer a large amount of prepared food for the busy yuppie on the go types, of which I have only sampled the fried chicken.  It was maybe not revelatory but nonetheless perfectly satisfying when eaten cold out of my refrigerator later in the night.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,6.30000019073,"place,place,center counter-top table,couple,blocks,neighborhood institution,sandwiches,outlets,place,issue,place,types,rotisserie chicken sandwich,wifi network,go types,freelancer,office space,hood,coffee,amount,food,establishment,service,sandwiches,options,strips,meat,standouts,amount,food,files,Crown Heights,Prospect,Glady,fried chicken,yuppie,refrigerator,sandwiches,amount,caveat,mayo,horseradish,arugula,mustard,porchetta,celery,capers,red onion,mayo type sauce,protein","7,7,7,1,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7","0.481216847897,0.0628282576799,0.051350209862,0.0453001782298,0.0453001782298,0.0453001782298,0.0358495600522,0.0217577945441,0.012260668911,0.0118025792763,0.0112214721739,0.0104825329036,0.0104230092838,0.0102953184396,0.00838243123144,0.00834827404469,0.00834827404469,0.00834827404469,0.00718078250065,0.00638273730874,0.00637118052691,0.00631305994466,0.00557558378205,0.00512574380264,0.00508116837591,0.00508116837591,0.00508116837591,0.00476951850578,0.00475568138063,0.00432596541941,0.00363544304855,0.00329523719847,0.00329523719847,0.00329523719847,0.00299603748135,0.00262138061225,0.00261788279749,0.0022498567123,0.00219905702397,0.00203744182363,0.0019044582732,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166619557422,0.00166337704286"

Yes, I'm a bit late to the game.  But I still have some stuff to share!Here's what I can say about Lincoln Station:I love this very hip space. It's open, airy, retro-chic, kind of like a general store meets an old fashioned pharmacy or something along those lines. Love that there is great seating! And good tunes flowing.Also it's not too pricey! There are excellent beer options too, but take note that they are all in bottles or cans, as there is nothing on tap as far as I know.I have been for dinner and breakfast.  It's definitely not fancy, but there are a lot of great options.  I've had the mac and cheese, the farro salad, and the kale salad, all of which were good!I  was really craving a bagel the morning I had breakfast there, but they don't have them here.   So I ordered the egg sandwich. I made sure to get it sans bacon, since I don't eat meat (yes, I know, I'm not the usual human.) The salsa stuff is good but maybe a bit too rich for my blood. I also prefer scrambled eggs. And the bun was soggy.   I think I suffer from egg sandwich purist syndrome but this sandwich was still good.

I didn't ask for him to assess my mood. And the reason I was upset at this point was because he refused to let me speak to the manager myself and he did not have any answers for me. After he spoke to the manager and the he says the manager says you have to go to seamless. I asked to speak to the manager so that I could talk to a person that was neutral. He said the manager is busy, I have 50 ppl standing in line and I have to go. And he hung up on me. Really. You messed up my order and somehow I was punished for it?

Wow, the coppa sandwich was super fresh and made with high quality ingredients - thinly sliced coppa, arugula, salsa rosa and thinly sliced lemon tucked in the sandwich!  The space is also quite nice and spacious, although this place is a popular happening spot so it does get crowded.  No worries though, just be patient and you'll find a seat eventually.  They also sell some high quality imported Italian goods at reasonable prices.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.5,8.19999980927,"cafe,place,cafe,food,deli,gourmet,coffee,Everyone,food menu,selections,cafes,chicken sandwich,other,garlic,place,bite,Lincoln Station,spot,menu,lunch,parsley,celery,capers,red onion,goat cheese,nuts,farro salad,cappuccino,mocha,sandwich,space,seat,worries,patient,prices,goods,coppa sandwich,coppa,lemon,salsa,rosa,arugula,ingredients,Italian","2,7,2,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.145188808441,0.09991286695,0.0937629342079,0.0855370461941,0.0779516771436,0.0751195549965,0.0751195549965,0.0418895967305,0.0219369847327,0.0214677397162,0.0174607243389,0.0139280632138,0.0139095177874,0.0110924234614,0.0106480689719,0.0103113455698,0.00979507807642,0.00969643052667,0.00966122373939,0.00931936688721,0.00929310638458,0.00929310638458,0.00929310638458,0.00929310638458,0.00927170366049,0.00927170366049,0.00927170366049,0.00846957787871,0.0081541640684,0.007927371189,0.00771685084328,0.00687782047316,0.00533923599869,0.0043597528711,0.00435494957492,0.00435494957492,0.00415601581335,0.00316565902904,0.00276969396509,0.00276969396509,0.00276969396509,0.00276969396509,0.00276969396509,0.00257864361629"

The closest alternative to one of my project sites is Applebee's. Well, technically, there's some Italian restaurant a few blocks away, but I am sort of skeptical that this ""restaurant"" is anything more than a Potemkin restaurant. Like a Truman Show style stage prop that exists only for me.So Lincoln Station definitely wins by comparison to Applebee's and potentially fake restaurant. The fact that they have an amazing rotisserie chicken sandwich doesn't hurt either. I seriously get excited when the sandwich is sitting there next to me in the passenger seat of my car and I can smell the celery and mayonnaise and grill char. I have usually opened the sandwich by the time I get to Atlantic Avenue and it's usually all gone by the time I get to Interfaith. Of course I drive safely, because the sandwich is never so much ""in my hands"" as it is ""completely stuffed into my face while I keep two hands on the wheel.""This sandwich is worth soiling work clothes over. Some people say it's too soggy and messy and I think they've stopped overstuffing and dressing it in response. Mistake as far as I'm concerned. This sandwich was born to be sloppy.Also, the chocolate chip cookies are insane.This empire is sort of uneven, obviously.

In that time all of the counter people who were too cool to be nice seem to have left--so I'm not brought back to being a loser math nerd with no friends every time I order anymore so that's good. Also I haven't gotten a poorly executed americano from here since I started coming back. Also they changed their menu pretty drastically. I used to think of this place as just a decent lunch place. Now it is a great lunch place (not just decent--GREAT sandwiches) and has stuff on their menu that make for truly high level tasty healthy balanced dinners too. It seems like all of their ingredients adhere to high standard of organic-ness. Very basic sounding stuff is executed so well like their rotisserie chicken dinner where the chicken is soft and delicious and you get a very healthy portion of the braised greens and roasted potatoes which are also delicious. I simply don't know of many places that have the balls to offer a meal that sounds so basic. You know how singers who don't have a strong enough voice to hold a single note do all of those fancy voice things to cover up the fact that they can't hold one note for long? It's like that. Lincoln Station can hold a single note--except a single note is a chicken dinner. And really anything else on their menu. Anyway I'm someone who is always still hungry after what is considered normal restaurant portions and I have never been still hungry after eating any of the full meals on their menu. Their meals are real meals that someone's chef mom would put together--like they meet the standards of being exciting yet maintain a homemade quality that makes them meals that you can crave and eat every day. If you're semi-adventurous about your meats, they're not afraid of meat's greatest hits like pork belly and tripe. They make delicious veggies and sides. They also have this Hungarian short bread with raspberry stuff in the middle that haunts my dreams. It's called Chef Anna's Hungarian Short Bread. You can watch them cooking everything in the kitchen area which is not separated by any walls from the eating area. I think I know which one Chef Anna is and she seems very nice and hard working and very serious about the food that she makes. She is pretty too so I think she is going to be one of those celebrity chefs one day.

And if you see what you think sounds like a good deal -- any three deli items for $7! -- you will inevitably be informed that it actually only applies to ordering, like, 2 individual vegetables and a grain of quinoa.So even when the food is great -- the breakfast sandwich, for example, or the French fries whose grease soaks straight through their paper bag container as good French fry grease should -- for me it's just not worth the ridiculous prices and the consistently inconsistent (sometimes just insultingly bad) service. Everything good that's served here I can get somewhere else in the neighborhood with way less hassle.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,3.09999990463,"door,prices,way,Lincoln Station,Upside,something,grease,things,fries,wander,Everything,counter,beanie,hipster pseudo-waiter,food,place,way,order,friend,service,style,deal,deli items,fry grease,Midtown,prices,paper bag container,Artisinal waiting,way,service,somewhere,French,neighborhood,hassle,food,example,breakfast sandwich,grain,vegetables,quinoa.So","7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.12624296546,0.125072523952,0.0756661593914,0.0754073932767,0.03976656124,0.03976656124,0.0359671190381,0.0319791771472,0.0309155490249,0.0287201553583,0.0273445565253,0.023170914501,0.023170914501,0.023170914501,0.0219016652554,0.0191689487547,0.0179339963943,0.0178904868662,0.0178904868662,0.0178904868662,0.0156568270177,0.014237231575,0.014237231575,0.0141549604014,0.0137346144766,0.0121600991115,0.0106405029073,0.00927545130253,0.00923783238977,0.00842209625989,0.00840266421437,0.00812206044793,0.00735199125484,0.00735199125484,0.00653662858531,0.00466910982504,0.00466910982504,0.00466910982504,0.00466910982504,0.00276383268647"

The kale was delicious, but it was on the salty/greasy side. This is most definitely not health food, even though veggies are represented. The porchetta did not have the rosemary flavor I associate with the classic Italian sandwich; it was more like a mild take on pernil, but it wore its caramelized onions and baby arugula well. Both were very tasty, well thought out and decent portions. Decor is upscale coffee/gourmet shop, and they sell prepared food by the pound, including fried chicken, mac & cheese and several vegetable dishes. The crowd had both the laptop and stroller battalions well represented, and the background music had acoustic guitar well enough represented so as not to scare them off.  The vibe was maybe just a little too precious for me.

Normally not that into sandwiches, I was totally wow-ed by the rotisserie chicken sandwich, my first sandwich here. The chicken was tender, even juicy and the mayo, parsley, capers, red onion, and garlic were perfect complements- not overwhelming and not detracting from the chicken. The egg sandwich here is heaven. A fried egg with juicy bacon (that's right, not over-cooked hardened bacon), cheese and salsa rosa on a perfectly baked ciabatta. And at five bucks- impossible to beat. The deli salads are great too- the roasted carrots and shallots salad is probably the most interesting of the bunch- lots of interesting, earthy, herby flavors that work well together. The escarole and beet salads are also good staples- nothing too surprising there. Surprisingly, this spot isn't too crowded (though always maybe at around 75% capacity) on weekend mornings. Pretty typical cozy Brooklyn interior- exposed brick, industrial style seats/stools, large communal table in the center.

Lincoln Station,5556,409 Lincoln Pl,Brooklyn,11238.0,13800,"So I'm gonna say right from the beginning Dear Reader that you might want to check this place out only on those occasions when you have ample enough time to spare. Yes time and patience is a type of currency here at Lincoln Station. What might cause your time to disappear into the abyss you ask? Well. The first thing, depending on the time you arrive, is a rush for the sales counter; which snakes from the door, around the back of the room, by the drinks cooler, past the pastries and kitchen, to finally the actual counter armed with two registers. Not that the serving of coffee or the ""taking"" of orders is slow. I think these guys do a bang up job, but this is obviously a very popular spot. Sometimes you can walk straight up to the counter. The next thing is the wait for food. We were told that there might be a thirty minute wait. This ""would"" have annoyed me had I been starving, or had I had something else to do on a Sunday afternoon. As it happens, I was with my social engagement, and I'd eaten before I'd met up with her, so not hungry. You might want to try this place just to try the food. I did. Or time your dining so that the ""Id"" won't push you into irritation each second that you wait for the satisfaction of your cravings. My friend's food showed up in five minutes. Mine showed up after she was done. The fifth thing that I noticed is that the hunt for a table will require some skill, patience, and the ability to bypass any social politeness you possess. After a brief huddle and agreement on the thirty minute thing, we sauntered over to the dining area only to find that the area was full. Popular place remember. So we stood there scouting, staring at people who were in their own zones with the occasional glances at the handful of people pining for a seat. I spotted a couple about to leave when the woman stood with her coffee, still engaged in conversation with a seated man until they noticed me staring at them. Then she half smiled, and he joined her in exiting. The people behind me, who were waiting a bit longer lamented missing the seat. This is NYC Brooklyn baby! The urban jungle is for the bold. The final time suck is for the food and atmosphere, which should be enjoyed at leisure. We sat at a small table, on a sunny day, next to the window. The place isn't super loud considering how busy it is. And the food is pretty good. My burger wasn't superhot when I got it. Flavorful, but literally less than room temperature. My friend commented on the fries by saying, ""they're greasy, but soooo gooood.""

Such a charming place, wonderful mocha and a sandwich to die for. I had the chicken sandwich, the bread was so wonderful and fresh, the chicken had an amazing delicate flavor, and I loved the garnish inside. Well thought out, with attention to detail and bias cut vegetables. It's hard to describe something so simple, fresh yet balanced in flavor. If you ever wanted a sandwich hand crafted by Al Di La, this is it! I wouldn't hesitate to try each and every single one, and I'd probably recommend them all. Soon, they will have rotisserie chicken and lasagne for take out. I can't wait! Prices are great and I can honestly say I may be a regular when I can't figure out what to make for dinner. It's in a great area right off the bike path near Grand Army Plaza.. Totally worth any distance trip. Plenty of space inside and so cozy. The mocha was flawless, and the prices weren't even a factor. I'd probably pay x2 as much for the quality, but I'm so glad it's reasonable... They also have Italian products for sale and I'm sure this place will blow up quickly, and I couldn't be happier for them and the neighborhood. Go there and be amazed.

I must say I LOVE their breakfast sandwich - it is messy as hell but so worth it (expect that sometimes you get fatty bacon that is impossible to chew - I wish they wouldn't do that, but I guess I could just ask next time). I also love the chicken sandwich - it is simple but the mayo makes it moist and the raw onions give it a kick. My favorite is definitely the duck - it is amazing.The last few things I wasn't so crazy about - The tongue sandwich was ENORMOUS and wayyy too much tongue. The tongue was in thick slabs and you could see all the bumps of the tongue and it started to make me feel queasy. The tongue was also not trimmed well because I kept getting chunks of chewy fat instead of tender tongue in every bite which made me want to stop eating. The tongue did have good flavor but the sandwich just wasn't put together very well.I also just tried the lamb sandwich tonight. I heard rave reviews but I was surprised to find that the rotisserie lamb was COLD on my sandwich, not what I was expecting at all from the ""rotisserie"" description. The meat was cold and realllly dry. There was only a bean spread  and a tiny bit of yogurt sauce to moisten up the sandwich as well. I really wish the lamb haws juicer (like you would expect rotisserie lamb to be), was hot, and that they would toast the bread. I honestly don't know why they wouldn't toast the bread - day old bread not toasted tastes pretty icky (I went there at 9pm), especially with a very dry sandwich. I wouldn't eat it again and I love lamb.I hope that Lincoln reads this because I think they have great potential just have been slacking on the care they have been putting into their sandwiches. I just feel like they have gotten more lazy within the last month (maybe because they are doing well) but they are going to lose customers if they stop putting love into each and every sandwich because that is what sets this place apart from all the rest. They should only give out sandwiches that they themselves would want to eat and I highly doubt they would have wanted to eat that lamb to tongue sandwich they gave me and that makes me sad.

Lincoln Station,5556,409 Lincoln Pl,Brooklyn,11238.0,4528,"On a rainy* Saturday** afternoon there is nothin' better than a hot meatball sandwich, amiright?Lincoln Station has one of the best darn meatball sandwiches I've had in this city.    We're talking delicious moist and really well seasoned meatballs and a layer of provolone (which was a nice change from the typical mozz) on a really amazing ciabatta roll.  Oh the roll!  Ciabatta is usually a good choice when it comes to saucy sandwiches but this particular roll was just perfect.  Chewy, soft on the outside with the slightest crunch from (I'm guessing) being heated on a flat top.  Everything about the sandwich is per-fect.  I also experienced my first Farro Salad at Lincoln.  Who knew these little grains could be so yummy?  Well, I'm sure a lot of people knew that, whatev.  This little salad had the farro, crumbled cheese (goat or feta?), spinach, and a few other items.  It was $4 for a small, yet filling, dish. I wouldn't hesitate to order my own little farro salad orrrrr try one of their other salads.  I think I counted 8 in the deli case and for $8.95 you can try any three, that's a pretty sweet deal. By the way my meatball sandwich was $10.95 and does not come w/ fries or chips or anything on the side.  The tray it was delivered on actually looked a little sad.  I wish for $11 they served it with somethin', maybe a little pile of mixed greens? I think the price of lunch was the one and only negative I've got for Lincoln.  When we got there around noon I was surprised to find a couple tables open.  There were mayyyybe 8 or so tables for parties of 2-4 people and a large community table top in the middle of the room.  And the room itself is really spacious, even with that big ol table in the middle there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into fellow customers.  And I kinda loved the big picture window up front, even on a rainy day it let in so much light.A few other notes: WiFi is available but if you're on a laptop you have to sit at the community table.Don't feel pressured to buy a beer or soda, icy cold water available via pitcher next to the counter.But those beers and sodas are all less than $4.  There's a sign painted on the wall that say so.Don't leave your trays/trash at your table- they've got a cart w/ bins for your dirty plates.-----------------* it doesn't have to be raining for you to enjoy this meatball sandwich.  I recommend it no matter the temperature or conditions outside. ** and it doesn't have to be Saturday either.  I image this sandwich would taste just as good on a Tuesday afternoon or a Wednesday night.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,11.6999998093,"change,meatball sandwiches,meatball sandwich,one,Ciabatta,amiright,city,Lincoln Station,meatballs,ciabatta roll,provolone,mozz,deal,sandwiches,sandwich,roll,one,roll,meatball sandwich,Everything,grains,flat top,outside,slightest crunch,sign,salad,tables,tables,Farro Salad,salads,trash,farro,people,price,tray,community table top,middle,people,community table.,table,cheese,goat,feta,items,spinach,dish,farro salad orrrrr,case,side,anything,chips,w/ fries,way,beer,somethin,pile,greens,lunch,parties,Chewy,picture window,sodas,beers,soda,trays,sandwich,meatball sandwich,pitcher,counter.,so.,Lincoln,lot,cold water,wall,cart w/ bins,plates.,conditions,temperature,room,ol table,mayyyybe,room,room,plenty,middle,customers,laptop,notes,front,WiFi","7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,6,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,4,3,1,7,7,6,6,7,7,6,1,2,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7","0.158151432872,0.0657045170665,0.0657045170665,0.0477726124227,0.0441899001598,0.0418581441045,0.0418581441045,0.0388883091509,0.0286611672491,0.0250966828316,0.0199939776212,0.0199939776212,0.0187604613602,0.0119626494125,0.0119014559314,0.0113692879677,0.00957448780537,0.00955826696008,0.00949573237449,0.00923538953066,0.00920182093978,0.0086387777701,0.00755932694301,0.00755932694301,0.0074005513452,0.00728955399245,0.00694356719032,0.00693881418556,0.00693000899628,0.0068264734,0.00678942119703,0.00635746261105,0.00579043850303,0.00549189001322,0.00546878483146,0.00524905929342,0.00524905929342,0.00524905929342,0.0051783490926,0.00517529761419,0.00505965622142,0.00505965622142,0.00505965622142,0.00505965622142,0.00505965622142,0.00505354907364,0.0050479802303,0.00504286261275,0.00503812916577,0.00503812916577,0.00503812916577,0.00503812916577,0.00503812916577,0.00467734783888,0.00460265949368,0.00460265949368,0.00460265949368,0.00459912465885,0.00459264591336,0.00447681872174,0.0039800782688,0.00391685590148,0.00391685590148,0.00391685590148,0.00391454715282,0.00373868155293,0.00369757483713,0.00342688639648,0.00342688639648,0.00342486612499,0.00342179136351,0.00337717239745,0.00321640283801,0.00320658250712,0.00252632936463,0.00237112399191,0.00236978777684,0.00236978777684,0.00231518014334,0.00227299844846,0.00198909733444,0.00189123139717,0.00189000146929,0.00179601414129,0.0017189491773,0.00150381063577,0.00150288036093,0.00150288036093,0.00150288036093,0.00108961237129"

My girlfriend had the audacity to inquire just how bleu cheesy the bleu cheese slaw was... bad move. ""Uh.. I don't have, like, any frame of reference for that"" was the answer she received. Now, as someone who has worked in food service, I could understand the risk in giving an answer to this question and then regretting it later. But a person who is more concerned about providing good service (aka, their job) could have just as easily said, ""It really depends on your taste preferences"" or ""do you want to try it?"" Clearly, service is a major issue here. Now I hate people who leave bad Yelp reviews based entirely on service, so, onto the food. $20 bucks for a sandwich on a brioche bun and a cup of soup is highway fucking robbery.

(I'm Puerto Rican) This past Sunday, 9/10/17 I went without him to get food & bring it home to my family & the way I was treated was just HORRIBLE. The cashier was pretty rude & seemed to have an attitude when I also tried to order steamed veggies which I always get when I go there & is sold to me in a small styrofoam bowl. On that day she said she couldn't sell it to me cause it's for the plates of food & insisted that it was never sold or given to me.

Linda’s Restaurant & Bakery,5559,5322 Church Ave,Brooklyn,11203.0,199025,"Sybil's dahl puri is one of the best dishes available in New York. They are thin and light with a generous amount of split peas and seasoning. To the uninitiated, dahl puri is a West Indian flat bread made mainly from flour and split peas. It is like a tortilla but constructed of a number of thin layers, so while it is thicker than a tortilla it feels thinner. The layers are stuffed with split peas, but it is lightly stuffed so that maintains its lightness. The end result is a food that is better than its Indian namesake. And Sybil makes the best in NYC, cause they keep their nice and light.For a more substantial meal, I would recommend the chicken curry and roti. This is kinda like a burrito or calzone, the roti on the outside makes a handy carrying case for the potato and chicken curry. It isn't the best curry I've had but it is better than most and a step up from burritos and calzones. Of course, we're talking about Guyanese curry rather than Indian curries. As a rule Guyanese curry is simpler, which makes it harder to screw up but not as good as the best Indian curries. I think overall, we hold our own - but I bias.Another highlight is the white pudding, unfortunately the pastries suck. The cheese rolls have too much roll and not enough cheese, and appear to be put together by a 10 year old with hand eye coordination issues, who is now learning to cook. I could do better.Linda's has a cash only policy, and service is not their strong suit. The staff could be friendlier, they are helpful and efficient, they just need to be nicer. When Linda's is packed, it can take a while to be served but you understand why - they are a lot of people in the store. When the crowd is manageable, you can get out in 10 minutes.

(good sign :) so today i went in and asked the nice lady behind the counter (and her son remembered me!)  (:  if i could please try both kinds of ribs in just a ""snack size"" portion, meat only.  she kindly obliged, and i got the 2 kinds of ribs they serve:  beef ribs, which are made in the oven.  they are the ""flanken style"" (ever have korean ribs?  the ones with those oval bones in the strip of meat?  that's the same cut of meat used for these ribs).  they were so tender, you could kiss the meat off the bones.  delicious and seasoned perfectly.  the second type of ribs were pork ribs - i got one long, big piece of that type, and i'm not sure what ""cut"" of meat it was, but it was GOOD.  the second kind is made on the grill outside, over charcoal flame, and the first kind is made in a pan in the oven.  i thought i was going to like the charcoal grill kind better, but (even though they were tasty and i definitely will order them again) the beef ribs win  (:  the sides are AMAZING - you can't go wrong w/ any selection (i love the collard greens (with cornbread) and the mac n' cheese).  and because i got banana pudding (i got the the last one!!!) last time i was there, i decided to try their peach cobbler this time.  it was DELICIOUS - just the right amount of sweet and spicy, spot on.  their prices are affordable, they don't try to price gouge you, and i am so grateful that there are still places making food for people who can't afford a half day's salary for a good meal!  i can't wait to go back again, and support this amazing new place - thank you, linda and team for being so wonderful!  (:",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,8.69999980927,"times,others,review,kinds,everything,ribs,lady,place,p,BBQ,bones,cut,kinds,businesses,review,businesses,people,beef ribs,ribs,flanken style,pork ribs,ribs,pockets,gentrification,privilege,folks,backs,money flow,meat,meat,food,meat,meat,meat,oven,peach cobbler,prices,people,type,cut,snack size,portion,son,counter,sign,ones,strip,brooklyn,w,collard greens,food,mac,cheese,cornbread,selection,spot,amount,piece,korean,place,places,banana pudding,meal,salary,team,kind,kind,type,grill,grill,oven,flame,pan,beef ribs win,sides,linda","7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,5,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,4,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,6,4,7,1","0.0805203318596,0.0692605599761,0.0659029632807,0.0566382296383,0.056316241622,0.0450110845268,0.0442775785923,0.0413043834269,0.0339277088642,0.025706211105,0.0245050862432,0.0233330205083,0.0154532371089,0.0137911997736,0.0116988960654,0.0116988960654,0.0116988960654,0.0112704848871,0.0112445000559,0.0104079311714,0.0102380737662,0.0102380737662,0.010237114504,0.010237114504,0.010237114504,0.010237114504,0.010237114504,0.010237114504,0.00989003572613,0.00983938295394,0.00967520382255,0.00900461990386,0.00898705516011,0.00895849335939,0.0078493244946,0.00770179973915,0.00766891101375,0.00743377301842,0.00712985312566,0.00712985312566,0.0068873311393,0.0068873311393,0.0068873311393,0.0068873311393,0.0068873311393,0.00685203587636,0.00685203587636,0.00606274185702,0.00531356129795,0.00482909008861,0.00472205737606,0.00464888429269,0.00464888429269,0.00464888429269,0.00464888429269,0.00463469326496,0.00463469326496,0.00460201362148,0.0040568667464,0.0040256883949,0.00378149328753,0.00342545076273,0.00320592522621,0.00320592522621,0.00320330262184,0.00317473476753,0.00317473476753,0.00308832502924,0.00239035743289,0.00233330507763,0.00233330507763,0.00204127747566,0.00204127747566,0.00203881133348,0.00191352516413,0.00189600419253"

Now just because its crowded don't feel like you need to rush. They still allow for the ultimate diner experience....you know what I'm talking about...the experience of taking your time, eating your food, and leaving whenever you feel like it. Hell I've stayed so long I've had to order all over again.  This is also a good place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, etc. There is a private room that can be rented out in the back. My family and friends have used it a dozen times. They also cater and when we had a bday party catered at home, the food was delicious and the price was fare.

I am not a diner goer because I hate the old school flair and mediocre food of most BUT Lindenwood a.k.a THE HOLLYWOOD of diners influenced me to have a change of heart. The menu here is rather extensive divided by Caribbean, latin and other fine cuisine.  Breakfast is served 24 hours round the clock and creatively dished up. I recently ordered the Fried Tilapia, grits and eggs breakfast. That was one of the best breakfast plates I've had in life. I was so stuffed I felt like I needed a wheel chair to get out of there. The pastries are limitless and decadent. The service is impeccable!  A friendly staff of stylish and eccentric people. I love coming here and will continue to take the trip to ""the hood"" aka East New York for grade A grub. They also have a Comedy night Mondays I hear. The back of the diner is decorated like a lounge and I believe you may also cater for events!  Lindenwood has raised the bar for typical diners. What a fine establishment.

Chef, I think you cooked a dead lobster!  I spoke to the waitress and she had the manager come over and I showed her the lobster and she thought perhaps that it was over cooked.  She took my plate back and brought out a new lobster that did not taste well at all.  The only thing on my plate that tasted good was the corn on the cob.  The clams were under-cooked, the sausage looked old so I did not dare touch it and the potatoes tasted old.  I ate two of the four jumbo shrimps and had to push the plate away.  The manager took half off of my $40 lobster meal. This was a VERY DISAPPOINTING MEAL!!! I suggest you don't order any of the Lobster dishes at this place because they have no idea how to prepare it.  My stomach still hurts.

I had Strawberry Mojito--freshly made taste like cheap light liquor was used.. and was very sweet...not bad Warm assorted bread was tasty Salad--very mediocre ..croutons taste homemadeCombo with shrimp scampi very delicious Crab legs --everyone raves about the crab legs but they literally taste like crab legs you make at home With old bay seasoning. Served with some type of buttery mystery liquid. Taste good nothing to rave about Waffle fries with cheese.. Next time be more specific to say put the cheese on the side ..very tasty Jerk salmon salad --salmon is flavorful and not too spicy and moist. Greens were fresh Mango dressing had a very off odd rancid soybean oil type of taste Until next time...,4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",1,0,0.0,5.30000019073,"dinner,waiter,back,ghetto group,Strawberry Mojito,crab legs,service,dining experience,people,bread,crab legs,legs,liquor,home,tables,shrimp scampi,croutons,salmon,everyone,bay seasoning,salmon salad,cheese,Crab,Salad,side,homemadeCombo,taste,soybean oil type,dressing,Jerk,mystery liquid,type,cheese,fries,nothing,Mango,Greens,Waffle","4,1,7,3,7,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7","0.151229307055,0.117419011891,0.0731602981687,0.0711842402816,0.059288777411,0.0548169054091,0.0334524922073,0.032377243042,0.0281868875027,0.0224850140512,0.0216553546488,0.0216553546488,0.0215245876461,0.0197035316378,0.0188945308328,0.0188413411379,0.0188413411379,0.0179290976375,0.017246382311,0.017246382311,0.0146459871903,0.0146459871903,0.0140294358134,0.0135962404311,0.012817658484,0.0127628995106,0.0101324412972,0.0101324412972,0.00944587867707,0.00759388785809,0.00645554345101,0.00645554345101,0.00644294731319,0.00563729880378,0.00563729880378,0.00525097316131,0.00384188792668,0.00333757209592"

It's not on the menu but just ask  because they will make you one!I eat here WHENEVER I visit Brooklyn! I had been telling a friend of mine that grew up in Coney Island about this place for years and so we were both in B'klyn at the same time and met here for dinner. The portions are huge, so we shared bbq ribs, yams, bacalaitos fritos (her first time eating them), salad and red wine! She loved it too! I told her I've been eating in this diner since I was 14. She too will be visiting whenever she visits Brooklyn. She told some of our other friends that live in San Francisco about this place and now there are more friends that grew up eating at diners in NY and want to eat here next time they are in New York. Even a friend from Long Island wants to go here next time she's in NYC!Maybe you should open up one in San Francisco, lots of Native New Yorkers missing real old time diners. Where else can you get brisket, ribs, jerk whiting, and bacalaitos fritos and many other ethnic dishes under one roof! I miss NY dining! Be back soon.  The manager Franklin is such a professional and gentle soul! The service is great! I like the new sidewalk dining section, but it was too hot for me and mommy to eat outside! There is plenty of parking unless you come on the weekends, it can be more difficult to find parking. It's on the border of Queens and Brooklyn and not far from the Belt Parkway. One suggestion, if you dare. When I visit  NYC, I go for the usual food I ate as a child: pizza, knish, beef patty, cheese cake, etc. Me and my friends that grew up in NYC miss egg creams.

It's been years since I last ate here, but it was on my way home this past Sunday and my friend and I were both famished. The coffee was just ok, nothing to rave about. My friend ordered the ""Italy Omlette"" which had mozzarella cheese and chopped pork sausage, it was very tasty and the portion was huge, it even came with a heaping serving of home fries and toast. It's something we would go for again. My meal however, a grilled chicken sandwich deluxe, the fries were on point and crisp, the sandwich however, the bread called a ""club roll"" was on the hard side, I can get a better hero at a bodega, c'mon people! The chicken some was ok and alot of it was dry, very dry and overcooked. The chicken was yellow from some sort of seasoning, Goya Adobo maybe? But it tasted of nothing, unremarkable.

Of course, we were seated immediately and put in the back area, which was freezing cold. We were not the only one complaining about the temperature, but it was something that could not be ignored. Especially, when you and your kids are trembling. The waiter, Angel, was extremely polite and very patient. After we received our food - fried calamari with a garden salad, chicken fingers, tostones (green plantains) and mozzarella cheese with fries; things went down hill. The garlic sauce was missing from the plantains, the chicken fingers were cold, my calamari tasted funny so I couldn't eat it and my son's mozzarella sticks were NASTY, per my 4 year son ""Yuck Mommy, can we go to McDonalds!"".  I have to also note we looked for our waiter for 15 mins and he never returned to ask if we needed a drink refill or if the food was okay. By the time he got to us I was not a happy camper. I did not raise my voice but kindly asked that he get a manager. The manager was too busy working the cash register to talk to me. He told the waiter to only refund my son's food - mozzarella sticks - kids meal.  Fortunately, we have another diner option. There is a new dinner in the Linden shopping area across the street called the Zone Diner. The managing team needs to be changed. I miss the previous manager, he is always humble and extremely courteous.

This is not your ordinary diner, but there are many familiar decor items like the revolving dessert stand and jukeboxes nestled at every booth. This place is huge! I ordered the island chicken breast stuffed with sweet plantains, red pepper, minus the jalapeno jack. No need for an appetizer, because it comes with your choice of soup or salad and potato or veggie. I decided on the most bizarre pairing, requesting French fries and broccoli.I was in the mood for a treat despite the large portion of food that I had consumed in its entirety, surprisingly. Here's a tip! The portions are very generous so it may not be a good idea to order an appetizer in addition to a meal. You'll wind up taking it home or leaving it all there at the table.Finally tried a banana split which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Lindenwood Diner & Restaurant,5562,2870 Linden Blvd,Brooklyn,11208.0,10959,"These Yelp reviews are curiously high. I really had to hold back being petty while seated at this diner...to start I really came for the 'Laffaholics Comedy Club' which is situated in a cornered off part of the diner. The restaurant provides table service to this area. Therefore, this comedy club also qualifies as part of the restaurant experience. This area includes a makeshift stage for the comedians and seating for at least 30 to 40 people (rough estimate). I only describe the area because I am trying very hard to justify how the service was so bad. Maybe the area isn't conducive to being properly attended, or maybe they are understaffed?My friend and I were seated and it took at least 10 minutes to receive a menu. Got the menu and asked for a glass of water and didn't receive the water for another 10 minutes. Ordered chicken fingers which took 15 minutes to come. Food comes and its a miserable plate of emaciated chicken fingers and boring fries. Yeah, its chicken fingers/fries from a diner but damn put some effort.Its possible that the waiters are not given the tools to make this area work since its not part of the diner as a 'whole' during the ""comedy club"". Or maybe this is par for the course since they really should just have a set group of waiters working this area. In general, I felt neglected and it pissed me off.

The first time 8 of my family members went to this diner together, it wasn't bad. The food was delicious. But today was different. The same 8 of us went there and experience the worst customer service ever from this guy in the picture. It was such a horrible experience for us and especially for me I've never had an issue with a restaurant staff before. I'm always pleasant. I always try not to bother them and I always say please and thank you. But yet this guy who 2 different waiters had 2 different names for Chris/Roland was just disrespectful. He is the staff by the bar that I posted the picture. We ordered a drink and we didn't get what we normal get. So we asked for something else but the waiter said we still have to pay for it even though we didn't drink it yet (that's something I have never heard before). We asked for the manager and this rude man came with his nonchalant attitude, rudely told us that we aren't allowed to order any other drink in the restaurant. He then took the drink and throw it in the garbage right next to us. His attitude and behavior in general was very uncalled. He acted very immature. Even though he seem like he was the one in charge, the waiter that served us acted more respect and mature than his boss. My cousins & I are very disappointed..... Also the food we all order was very nasty. No flavor, no taste. This is the first time ever that I didn't want to finish my food or take home leftovers. We ordered the broiled seafood that comes with tilapia, shrimp, and the waste clam ever.... I recommend the new restaurant across the street. I think it's called ozone. It's in the mall. Everything we tried on their menu tasted heavenly for the prices plus they have a lot of parking space. The only con is that they close around 11/12....

Lindenwood Diner & Restaurant,5562,2870 Linden Blvd,Brooklyn,11208.0,158316,"The service was good, it was the food that somewhat disappointed me. I did a takeout order, and I was acknowledged immediately, the order was enetered quickly and packed expertly by the waitstaff. I read all of these wonderful reviews and saw all of these beautiful pictures of the food that made me salivate, but the actual food itself is really not that great. The shrimp mac and cheese is a beautiful looking dish with lots of shrimp and a light crusting, however the taste was somewhat bland. I tasted lots of butter but there was no salt of pepper within it. The jerk wings look good, but taste very watered down. The fried cajun catfish are beautifully browned but they don't have the seasoned flavor that you expect from a cajun seasoned meal. The only dish that really met my expectations was the jumbo shrimp scampi over spaghetti. Each bite is bursting with the flavor of fresh garlic and olive oil, and the jumbo shrimp are cooked perfectly. The portion sizes you are provided with are more than ample, but it was surprising that so many people rave about how well seasoned all the food from this place is and I still had to mix my own seasoning in the food once I got home. I love the decor, there's lots of parking, there's lots of space to walk around, it is very clean and I can appreciate that though there isn't an abundance of staff, the staff who are present work together seamlessly and keep the place running like a well oiled machine.

When we ordered, service was a little slower than expected with our food coming about 1.5 hours after we placed our order (the expected delivery time was 45min - 1hr). The food was a mixed bag. Ordered the staples - CHIPS & GUAC ($8.50), STEAK TACOS ($3) and CARNITAS TACOS ($3). One minor thing I always look for in Mexican restaurants is house-made, fresh tortilla chips and these were IT - well-salted, toasty and tasty. The guac was creamy, but I prefer mine a little spicier and chunkier, nevertheless tasty! The steak tacos were good, but I wish there was a better balance of fat and lean meat; also, the steak was chopped too finely so I felt the meat quality was compromised. The carnitas tacos were less impressive - wouldn't recommend. However, all tacos were wrapped with good-quality tortillas with ample meat and topped with fresh/clean ingredients, including essentials such as radishes, cilantro and lime. Overall, think there are a few improvements need to be made here, and don't think I'll reorder unless its for the chips & guac.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,4.19999980927,"apartment,takeout,food,service,Mexican,food,CHIPS,tortilla chips,order,guac,staples,thing,meat,balance,restaurants,tacos,fat,CARNITAS TACOS,STEAK TACOS,meat,tortillas,lime,cilantro,ingredients,radishes,guac,chips,steak tacos,steak,improvements,essentials,meat quality,carnitas tacos","2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7","0.131915166974,0.131915166974,0.117532379925,0.0758999809623,0.075309060514,0.0727008804679,0.0305321048945,0.0281610526145,0.0245423987508,0.0245186444372,0.0243287943304,0.0200767535716,0.0187736134976,0.0178437419236,0.0164029449224,0.0159887280315,0.0149503229186,0.013994266279,0.013994266279,0.0139938201755,0.0127307744697,0.011141223833,0.011141223833,0.011141223833,0.011141223833,0.00968306604773,0.00968306604773,0.00931029208004,0.00774453999475,0.00770750502124,0.00654607312754,0.00560809345916,0.00304762483574"

PLEASE MAKE IT AN OPTION TO GIVE ZERO STARS!!!The food in this place needs to be inspected by the center for disease control ASAP! The food is inedible! Completely disgusting! My office ordered lunch from F Line Bagels today and I thought, eh, what the hell, I'll give it a try (this is exactly why I rarely listen to my intuition!). I ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap or, what I refer to it as, raw sewage. The wrap was the most DISGUSTING thing I've ever had in my life! I had a total of 3 bites, each made me believe less and less in God! Yup, it was THAT bad! The chicken and sauce literally tasted as if the person who made it poured salt on it for a good 30 minutes straight before dousing the thing with a pound of soy sauce. Hm, that's weird, last time I checked, teriyaki sauce didn't have the 18 lbs. of salt and some generic soy sauce as the main ingredients! The chicken alone tasted as if it were sitting on the stove for a few weeks and someone, me, just so happened to order it today right before they were about to donate it to science for mold experimentation. I know I may have said once or twice in my past reviews of other joints that that had been the worst food I've ever had but NOPE! This place definitely takes that shiny medal of disgusting, CDC needed food! Every bite was welcomed with 3 huge gulps of water. By the end of my TRYING to eat this wrap, I had killed 2 1/2, 23-ounce sports water bottles. Thank god we have those in this office or else I would have died of sheer dehydration due to all the disgusting salt! I swear, I wish I were exaggerating on the sheer disgust I have for their food! My coworker ordered from this place last week, a burger and fries, and when it arrived, she opened her burger and....no meat! It was a bun that had nothing on it....nothing! It's like they took a burger bun from the Schwebel's bag and placed it nicely with the super soggy fries in the styrofoam container. Are you guys THAT lazy over there? Or did you think that a customer wouldn't notice that a burger was missing everything? She called this place back after noticing this mistake and the conversation went a little something like this:Coworker: Hi you guys just delivered to us and [interrupted]F Line Douche Bag: yea yea yea, we'll get you another burger.Coworker: Oh, so you guys KNEW you just sent over a bun??F Line DB: Yea, someone's coming over in a few minutes.

If this were 7 years ago and we were being punk'd, even Ashton Kutcher would say ""Not cool, bruh.""Bottom line: If you crave the sensation and taste of raw sewage being doused all over your taste buds OR if you want food that isn't complete delivered right to your front door, call F Line Bagels!

Line Bagels,5565,476 Smith St,Brooklyn,11231.0,9345,"I have been holding back on giving an honest review of Line Bagels. The convenience of the location has jaded our evaluation worthy of the public's consideration. Their food quality and customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Please note that we have bought very often -- almost every day-- from Line Bagels, mostly tamales which sometimes arrive drier than on other days. We also live literally across the street from the establishment. That they can blow off regular customers is a sad anecdote to customer service in the food industry today.-- First, the young man at the cashier never thanks me for my business. I will thank *him,* but in response, he'll mutter, ""No problem."" (Why on earth would my keeping your business afloat be a *problem*?!)-- The young cashier man has been rude to a family member of mine.To the point that my family member has not returned to Line Bagels since the rudeness incident.-- The quality of the food is inconsistent. One day, a food order went really bad. See photo of cheeseburger sandwich (raw AND cold) and Grilled Chicken Caesar wrap sandwich with hair in it.-- When I first phoned to alert Line Bagel about the above food issues last week, especially the burger that my husband attempted to eat that was raw and cold, we agreed that I would call back for a replacement sandwich another day (my husband lost his appetite after receiving the cheeseburger). ""No problem"" said the man on the phone, in typical Line Bagels fashion. Today was the day to redeem that cheeseburger credit.-- I phoned to attempt to get a replacement on the cheeseburger. I didn't need a credit for two sandwiches, just one. The response from Line Bagel after putting me on hold for an extended amount of time was, ""All our delivery people are out."" In two years, this was a first. Something reeked of distrust on their end. I mentioned that we did, in fact, have this conversation previously because I took photos and mentioned that, too. Did they want this stuff emailed to them? They put the phone down to speak with Luz, the owner. There was much back and forth between the guy on the phone and Luz telling him how to handle me. ""But she has the photos. She had evidence,"" said the guy who I had been talking with. ""No. Tell her I want her to come in. I want to see her face.""  I honestly could not believe my ears. This is not customer service friendly behavior -- it is retaliatory behavior! Further, Luz knows me. I reminded the man on the phone that Luz sees my family as customers nearly every single day and I had the receipt, photos, everything on the botched order. No. They resisted. ""She wants you to come in.""Which is impossible, as we are working at our respective offices right now. My husband would have to literally close the doors on business in order to pick up his sandwich.

Lioni Italian Heroes,5571,7803 15th Ave,Brooklyn,11228.0,12708,"A friend of mine had told me about Lioni's Italian Heroes in Bensonhurst, a neighborhood that we rarely visit when we go to Brooklyn because it's just so far! She said that they are known for their homemade mozzarella which they make fresh every morning and their huge assortment of Italian heroes. So when we met up to go catch a Yankees game, she kindly offered to pick up heroes from Lioni's so that we could try it.Lioni's menu is over 5 pages long and features 150 different heroes-- all their heroes are named after famous Italian role models. Most of their heroes feature Lioni's fresh mozzarella, Boar's Head deli meats, and Italian bread from Cammerari's Famous Brooklyn Bakery and Cafe.Our friend warned us that their heroes are HUGE so we decided to get one to share. Imagine how long it took for us to pick just one! I really wanted to get a sandwich that would allow their mozzarella to shine so we finally decided on #30 THE TOMMY LASORDA ""Can't Dodge This One!"" with Prosciutto di Parma, Lioni's mozzarella, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, salt and fresh basil. Even though I was properly prepared, I was still shocked by how big the sandwich was.Most sandwiches featuring prosciutto will skimp on the prosciutto but not Lioni's! There was so much prosciutto I almost wished they hadn't put so much! And the mozzarella did not disappoint-- it was luscious and creamy and oh so tender. I'll have to get a ball of their mozzarella to use in some of my recipes next time.

I got the #62, the Alyssa Milano, which seems to be a Yelp favorite. There's about 150 different types of sandwiches, so it's so overwhelming to choose, but once you read about 10 choices, you get a good feel of what meats/toppings they have, so you can always tell them what you want on a sandwich and they can pick for you.The Alyssa Milano has a chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella, basil mix and prosciutto on it. I scarfed down 1/4 of this $15 sandwich, but the flavor isn't there. The chicken cutlet is thin and tasteless, the mozzarella cheese is good (but mozzarella doesn't have a strong flavor by itself), the prosciutto tastes very standard and the basil mix could have been stronger. The bread also is very standard.Yes, it's better than Subway's, but even a 10-minute walk to Lioni doesn't seem worth it.

Great food, reasonable prices, and a savior when the only other places open on Seamless are meh.Pros:(1) Quality of ingredients and bread is very high, and the quality is consistent.(2) Portion size is large. $12 may seem a lot for a sandwich, but the heroes are literally served on an entire loaf of Italian bread. Two sandwiches from them is enough for 4 meals for me.(3) Flavor of sandwiches is amazing (I have gotten probably about 25 different sandwiches at this point.)(4) Friendly service. There have two or three times I have ordered (our of probably 30 times) where they did not have a certain side (e.g., pickles or cole slaw). They called right away and offered to give another side, with extra portions (usually potato croquettes, which are also very good). Cons:Honestly, there are not many. These negative points are very small and the positive points above outweigh them by far.(1) Delivery was a bit slow a few times, but I'm about 1.3 miles away, so it could just be that. I have waited over 75 minutes before for a delivery. (Still worth it though.)(2) I think they're a family-run business, and so may not always be open for delivery. (They have a store front though.) So sometimes they are available at odd times on Seamless. I think they tend to stop delivery early (around 6pm). If they are on Seamless, then they are open, so there's no problem with ordering from them and finding out they are closed. I just wish they had longer hours since I often don't get home from work until after 7pm anyway.)(3) I don't 100% like the large menu. Their being on Seamless has helped tremendously with that since you can search food items on Seamless. (So, for example, you can search ""salami"" or ""mozzarella"".) Before Seamless, I would have to read almost the entire menu to find what I wanted. The menu has probably about 125 sandwiches, all with names of famous Italians. I wish the menu were organized by ingredient instead. So, all salami sandwiches together. All ham sandwiches together, etc. But at this point it's not a big deal since I know what I like and, again, Seamless makes finding what you want very easy anyway.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,14.1999998093,"sandwich,mozzarella,Seamless,Seamless,sandwiches,sandwiches,menu,Lioni,deli sides,macaroni salad,mozzarella,cole slaw,potato croquettes,business,places,times,points,potato croquettes,place,something,Pros,sandwiches,time,Quality,sandwich,sandwiches,sandwiches,ingredients,food,Delivery,start,savior,prices,quality,menu,times,delivery,side,service,points,Portion size,bread,bread,cole slaw,portions,many,Seamless,Seamless,Cons,lot,loaf,heroes,Flavor,me.,meals,pickles,menu,far.,side,mozzarella,salami,sandwiches,salami sandwiches,ham sandwiches,menu,work,home,food items,example,Italians,ingredient,names,deal,menu,delivery,times,delivery,problem,store front","7,7,3,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7","0.357653200626,0.0385811850429,0.0326154492795,0.0296731013805,0.0274550300092,0.0273153800517,0.022515097633,0.0217955876142,0.0197139978409,0.0197139978409,0.0195424556732,0.01793933101,0.01793933101,0.0174432899803,0.0161378495395,0.0139581309631,0.0116976071149,0.0108256433159,0.0107293333858,0.00984951946884,0.00896137580276,0.00852992385626,0.00852276105434,0.0082582058385,0.00697545194998,0.0069661536254,0.0069661536254,0.00674413982779,0.00633039744571,0.00620831502602,0.00592287397012,0.00590133387595,0.00590133387595,0.00557736773044,0.00522999418899,0.00519954087213,0.00519499881193,0.00498659722507,0.00492840819061,0.00489648710936,0.00488014146686,0.0045540840365,0.00454729283229,0.00453574536368,0.00453074788675,0.00452615506947,0.00441501289606,0.00441014813259,0.004248295445,0.00397867010906,0.00397867010906,0.00397867010906,0.00397336110473,0.00397336110473,0.00397336110473,0.00396856479347,0.00386518891901,0.00362057960592,0.00353783834726,0.00337787019089,0.00337787019089,0.00326084252447,0.0032576629892,0.00325616146438,0.00318891950883,0.00269108149223,0.00269108149223,0.00268949498422,0.0026879797224,0.00235555553809,0.00212379475124,0.00185896398034,0.00185546837747,0.00177881470881,0.00170127325691,0.0016987338895,0.00169756950345,0.0013750246726,0.0011833247263"

I've never gotten anything sub par here.  The prices for hero's range from seven bucks up to the twenty dollar mark.  Seriously though, for one sandwich, you can feed about 3 people.  I've ordered delivery from here and went to the actual store itself.  Delivery was always speedy and friendly.  The actual store itself is a cozy spot.  With some table and chair space to dine in.  Most of the time regular locals are in said seating.  Their customer service in house could be a lot friendlier.  Not a hello or a smile.  They don't acknowledge your presence right away.  Takes a few minutes.  They have TONS of people working in the back, making sandwiches, which is great.  They have a great selection of Italian products.  Fresh breads, meats and cheeses.  Their burrata is only $5.99 for a container of 2.  It's so fresh, creamy and delicious.   Their homemade Sicilian salami tastes like no other.  The way real salami should taste!  They have over 150 sandwiches so it totally pays to try something new every time.  Hard to choose a favorite because every 'wich is delicious.  The Marisa Tomei is awesome and a great option for non-meat eaters.  Fried eggplant, Lioni fresh mozzarella & Mushroom Stuffing.  The mushroom stuffing is so good.  Beware of your blood pressure after eating here.  Lots of stuff, not only the cured meats, are VERY salty.  Even the eggplant!  The Teddy Randazzo is also interesting and yum.  Mortadella with pistachio, fresh ricotta, salt & pepper.  The ricotta is a nice touch.  The Mortadella, which I'm normally not so fond of, is pretty spectacular.  Not too fatty.  If you enjoy smoked mozzarella, they don't disappoint with that either.  I tired the Bernadette Peter's sandwich.  Lioni smoked mozarella, Lioni fresh mozarella , arugula, olive oil, lettuce, salt, pepper and oregano.  It's a bit of an overload of mozzarella, but still a good 'wich.  For me, their bread totally makes the sandwich.  Always fresh, soft and chewy.Bottom line, for a great price, you get a huge meal with only the freshest, tastiest ingredients possible.  If you're looking for a filling sandwich that may last for your lunch and/or dinner for the next day, give Lioni's a shot!",5.0 star rating,"Middle Village, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,23.8999996185,"wich,sandwiches,Lioni,sandwiches,sandwich,prices,sandwich shop,question,quality,quantity,anything sub par,sandwich,locals,Mushroom Stuffing,store,Delivery,spot,ricotta,people,delivery,store,sandwiches,Mortadella,dollar mark,hero,range,table,mushroom stuffing,wich,Lioni,customer service,burrata,presence,mozzarella,people,stuff,breads,meats,salami,salami,sandwich,favorite,blood pressure,chair space,Most,seating,lot,house,smile,hello,TONS,back,products,selection,cheeses,container,no other,way,option,eaters,Lots,mozzarella,mozzarella,pepper,mozarella,mozarella,salt,bread,line,oregano,arugula,olive oil,lettuce,overload,Marisa Tomei,meal,sandwich,Italian,Sicilian,price,ingredients,lunch,dinner,shot,Bernadette Peter,meats,eggplant,pepper,salt,ricotta,pistachio,Bottom,Teddy Randazzo","7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,4,4,5,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,1","0.0490913912654,0.0472198016942,0.0470620319247,0.0468918345869,0.0354062393308,0.032153327018,0.0284988600761,0.0283955559134,0.0283156838268,0.0283156838268,0.0281956698745,0.0176329389215,0.0172485541552,0.0168387051672,0.0149869434536,0.0146284922957,0.0132820298895,0.0125639829785,0.0122840385884,0.0122676631436,0.0122676631436,0.011752021499,0.0108969807625,0.0107650486752,0.0107650486752,0.0107650486752,0.0106990626082,0.0100661851466,0.00916849076748,0.00890410318971,0.00883169658482,0.00878894887865,0.00822858326137,0.00822291895747,0.0082169957459,0.00821266975254,0.00820658262819,0.00820658262819,0.00819271057844,0.00818847399205,0.00799308717251,0.0075297281146,0.00747307017446,0.00722417514771,0.00721739418805,0.00721739418805,0.00721108680591,0.00721108680591,0.00720519153401,0.00720519153401,0.00718951737508,0.00718951737508,0.00718484586105,0.00718484586105,0.00718040484935,0.00717617291957,0.00716826459393,0.00716455746442,0.00654694344848,0.00654694344848,0.00613453565165,0.00611511943862,0.00604377454147,0.00556368473917,0.00556368473917,0.00556368473917,0.00556368473917,0.00556032685563,0.00492538139224,0.00486768921837,0.00486768921837,0.00486768921837,0.00486768921837,0.00486620236188,0.00474767433479,0.00433889217675,0.00429123966023,0.00425380468369,0.00424398249015,0.00384855363518,0.0033669823315,0.00336602306925,0.00336602306925,0.00336602306925,0.0028823313769,0.00244780257344,0.00244684726931,0.00244502187707,0.00244502187707,0.00244502187707,0.00213900674134,0.00199286243878,0.00155137944967"

I've been wanting to try out Lioni's Italian Heroes for quite a while now but because of school exams and work, I haven't had time to make my way here, until today! I got here at around 3pm and there was only 1 person ahead of me in line. I have to admit, while I was walking here, I was actually kind of nervous that I would have to deal with horrible service from Italian servers after the terrible service that I got from Dyker Park Bagels. However, it turns out that the servers here are super friendly! (thank god!). The decor of the deli may seem kind of cluttered and the menu can be hard to read since there are so many choices to choose from, but everything in the deli just looks so delicious! I seriously wanted to buy everything in the store!So I decided to get the #62 Alyssa Milano since it seems to be quite popular based on  yelp reviews. I have no regrets. I have to admit, it was kind of painful for me to have to fork over $15 for a sandwich but believe me, it is worth it! The sandwich is HUGE! I'm normally a big eater but I actually had trouble finishing half of the sandwich. I think it's possible to split the sandwich up into 3-4 meals so in the end, the $15 is worth it. The sandwich was amazing. Chicken cutlet, prosciutto, and mozzarella cheese may sound like a sea water-salty combination but the bread definitely counters the saltiness! I like how the bread is actually not that tough so that it's not too hard to bite into. As a matter of fact, I thought the bread had just the perfect texture! The pesto sauce elevates the sandwich to a different level...Overall, I thought the components of the sandwich blended together very well and I found the sandwich as a whole to be absolutely divine.It's definitely not healthy to order such meat-packed sandwiches from here often but definitely stop by once in a while to treat yourself to something amazing :)",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,10.5,"eater,servers,Heroes,everything,school exams,work,service,Italian,way,Lioni,service,sandwich,person,sandwich,sandwich,line,menu,sandwich,deli,deli,$15,decor,bread,god,store,yelp reviews,regrets,choices,half,trouble,bread,Dyker Park Bagels,sandwiches,sandwich,sandwich,Alyssa Milano,texture,fact,matter,level,pesto sauce,sandwich,sandwich,components,whole,something,bread,end,meals,saltiness,sea water,combination,mozzarella cheese,prosciutto,Chicken cutlet","1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.665732681751,0.0370990820229,0.0270441938192,0.0242975819856,0.0163635779172,0.0163635779172,0.0157442186028,0.0145509289578,0.0127181271091,0.00971384346485,0.00839819200337,0.00788487959653,0.00744447577745,0.00644832104445,0.00643346598372,0.00623640744016,0.00510315969586,0.00478415889665,0.00476247444749,0.00476247444749,0.00466069579124,0.00438388716429,0.00433943560347,0.00417550560087,0.00416032131761,0.00416032131761,0.00415412010625,0.00391165493056,0.00378786423244,0.00378786423244,0.00377223291434,0.00368134793825,0.00331358984113,0.00331358984113,0.00331358984113,0.00317448936403,0.00281792040914,0.00281792040914,0.00281792040914,0.00281588011421,0.00281588011421,0.00251543172635,0.00210840837099,0.00194976269267,0.00194976269267,0.00194976269267,0.0015559468884,0.00124032318126,0.00124032318126,0.00123807438649,0.00123807438649,0.00123807438649,0.00123807438649,0.00123807438649,0.00123807438649"

Prosciutto di Parma, LIONI FRESH MOZZARELLA, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, salt and fresh basilthis was so good if you are a proscuitto fan.  i love anything salty and i love proscuitto.  this was a perfect sandwich for me and they gave a lot!   i was able to split this into two meals.   if you aren't really into salty things, this might be too salty for you.  this is per my bf's opinion since he had a bite and didn't really like it.   he felt it was too much and the salt was excessive.  i loved it.  i guess to each their own.   btw - this still tasted good the next day.the bf ordered #60    MARISSA TOMEI ""Give This to Your Cousin Vinny"" Fried eggplant, LIONI FRESH MOZZARELLA and LIONI mushroom stuffing.   this was good.  i loved the fried eggplant and the mushroom stuffing was great.  the only thing that would have made it better was if they gave more fried eggplant.  i felt they gave too little.  i also wished there was some type of sauce.  overall, this was a good sandwich, but i think i'll try something else on the menu next time.  i've also had the veal and sausage in the past and i remember they were very good.the menu is a little overwhelming if you go in to order.  it'll take you a good few minutes to figure out what you want.  i would suggest you look at the paper menu or online to narrow down your choices.the people that own the place are really nice and very accommodating.   they are a true family owned business that takes pride in making sure their customers are happy.   i usually take my sandwich to go, but they have a few seats in the front.  i am little self conscious to sit there because of the constant influx of people walking in and out.a CC charge has to be $10 or more.   oh yea, if you go towards the end of the day when they close, you'll risk them running out of bread or stuff to make your hero with.  that's how you know this stuff is legit, fresh and the real thing =).  they keep you coming back for more!!!good job lioni.  i'll be back!!!",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,16.0,"hero sandwich place,groupon,proscuitto fan,sandwich,sandwich,bf,place,brooklyn,trip,groupon,all,accident,home,business,thing,bite,NYC,proscuitto,salt,anything,something,basilthis,oregano,olive oil,tomatoes,fried eggplant,salt,mushroom stuffing,mushroom stuffing,things,Fried eggplant,fried eggplant,menu,bf,LIONI FRESH MOZZARELLA,type,sandwich,Prosciutto di Parma,lot,meals,opinion,sauce,veal,sausage,TOMMY LASORDA,This One,more,LIONI,pride,stuff,people,people,seats,front,charge,influx,customers,stuff,job lioni,MARISSA TOMEI,Cousin Vinny,thing,bread,menu,hero,CC,place,paper menu,family","2,3,1,7,7,1,7,2,4,7,7,4,2,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,4,1,7,1,1,5,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1","0.299129545689,0.059311170131,0.0509256161749,0.0476355925202,0.0291576050222,0.0281032305211,0.0260067805648,0.0257850438356,0.0245056729764,0.0236658398062,0.020717965439,0.020717965439,0.0206121895462,0.0188033208251,0.0175117962062,0.0136878099293,0.0122853852808,0.0101967547089,0.00895056314766,0.00811658240855,0.00789317674935,0.00783206801862,0.00783206801862,0.00783206801862,0.00783206801862,0.00781806278974,0.00714525626972,0.00705892406404,0.00704699428752,0.00659555755556,0.00655874377117,0.00598738528788,0.00597506947815,0.00596576044336,0.00575538165867,0.00568190542981,0.0055784014985,0.00553863216192,0.00526582403108,0.00525692105293,0.00524207670242,0.00475820666179,0.00475217495114,0.00475217495114,0.00465133460239,0.00465133460239,0.00444953516126,0.00418000901118,0.00412672804669,0.00405770726502,0.00404705572873,0.00399242900312,0.00354254152626,0.00354254152626,0.00354078039527,0.00354078039527,0.00332666793838,0.00331428158097,0.00322837056592,0.00309036066756,0.00309036066756,0.00307781551965,0.00245017418638,0.00239710113965,0.00217323470861,0.00209595798515,0.00195461302064,0.00195461302064,0.00174233666621"

Lioni Italian Heroes,5571,7803 15th Ave,Brooklyn,11228.0,686,"Lioni is a Brooklyn institution. I'm a bit ashamed to say that as long as my family has lived here, I never stopped in. But that all changed one day when my parents let ME choose lunch over Thanksgiving break.It's been said a lot and probably better, but they have a LOT of sandwiches. Over 140 of them. Most of them are very close variations of each other, which is kinda cheating. But still.I went with the #25 and the #52 (y'know, for symmetry). The #25 was The Louie Prima (hot capicola, salami, pepperoni, swiss, provolone, stuffed peppers and deli mustard). It was a cold cut sandwich, and was just too overloaded to taste anything other than the pepperoni and swiss. Each bite was different, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The #52 was the Lee Iacocca (roast beef, Lioni fresh mozzarella and brown gravy). I don't know what was in that brown gravy (and I dare not ask), but it was delicious. Nice pink roast beef layered on thick.My only complaint was how long it took. I called in my order for pickup and they told me 20 minutes. I showed up 25 minutes later, and didn't get my sandwiches until 35 minutes afterward.

I could easily just eat up a ball of just on its own. I'd even say buy some to take home & enjoy it as you wish. Pricey compared to packaged cheese but you are getting your monies worth. The price for cheese is cheaper here than when saw it once in whole foods.Love going on Thursday when they have steak. Found the roast beef to be very flavorful & locals from Brooklyn or fans of the well known Johns Deli will think I speak blasphemy but found the roast beef here was better.Indeed a vast choice to decide so grab a menu or download prior to going as to not be overwhelmed. If possible also call ahead for orders near lunch time. Next door they also have a butcher shop, good quality cuts & looks much more appealing than a tray in a supermarket.Granted I love the choices & cheese but the one thing I can say is not great is the bread. Just taste like any other store bought bread, I have had much richer & more flavorful bread. Perhaps it is bought, though if they made some on premise I'm sure it would be great. Though 1 thing won't let me sway from giving it a high rating.Plus they sell soda with real sugar cane like days of old, not this current sweetener or over processed sugars. More expensive than a can of Coke or Pepsi but a much different taste. Plus it is in a bottle. I am a believer that it taste much better in a bottle.

I placed an order for Delivery online and called the store to ask that they call a different number than the one listed on the account. I wrote this in the special instructions BUT ON 2 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, the delivery guy just shows up and rings different bells (including my landlord) until someone gets in touch with me.First lady answers the phone. I'm attempting to explain what's going and she cuts me off to tell me they haven't received the order yet. I ask if I can just leave the number with her and she cuts me off again saying ""we don't have the order yet."" I explain that I heard her the first time and before I can say anything else she puts me on hold again.I am then disconnected.Then I call back and attempt to explain myself to the guy that answers the second time. Keep in mind my only intent is to insure the delivery guy has the right phone number because this has been an issue in the past and I'm attempting to save him from just standing outside ringing bells and wasting his time. My mistake. The guy reads the message to me and goes ""yea I see it you wrote it."" I explain it had been an issue in the past and he cuts me off and goes ""well how about you change it there you go that will give you something to do today yaaaayyyy"" and then attempts to scold me for the inconvenience of calling him with such an annoying matter while he's ""busy making sandwiches."" Of course you are. That's your job. Perhaps your time could be better spent honing in those customer service skills. Not that it matters, but the phone number on the account belongs to my partner who occasionally travels and it's just easier to write a little note with my number in the delivery instructions. If they followed the instructions in the first place I wouldn't have to waste my time and call, which in turn, is a waste of your time.  I understand this.

Everything is fresh; the breads, meats, and  cheese! wow. I'm definitely going to buy my mozzarella from here whenever I make pizza ($5 a mozzarella ball). To think it took me so long to try this place out! ugh!I was a skeptic when I first heard about this place, that was of course before i took a bite of out of these sandwiches. I was so foolish then haha. I thought hmmmmmmm. . . .150 sandwiches? They must have been foolishly put together, how else could they have thought up with that many? WRONG. Of the sandwiches that I've eaten, it seems like everything was very well thought out and took a lot of time and care to come up with. The flavors worked well together in a good balance. For example, prosciutto is a salty meat so the mozzarella helps balance that out; The fresh mozzarella has little taste on its own so their basil mix helped bring out some of the mozzarella. And the olive oil in the basil mix seeped into the bread giving the bread extra flavor. A harmonious sandwich indeed.10-15 bucks for a little sandwich? We need to remind them this isn't Manhattan! FAIL. The price seems steep at a glance but isn't at all. The sandwich itself was about 2-3 pounds.( i used my arm to measure this) There was A LOT of meat. All the ingredients were top notch and completely worth it for the price. I'm a pretty big eater and half of the sandwich was enough for my lunch today. I could have probably stuffed my face and eaten the whole thing, but i really cant imagine ANYONE eating 2 of these.( two of those puny subway sandwiches are nothing for me haha)In essence, if you like sandwiches, this gem won't disappoint.

Lioni Italian Heroes,5571,7803 15th Ave,Brooklyn,11228.0,2655,This review is for the location in the Dekalb Food Market and is a 2.5 star review. There is nothing special about these sandwiches other then the full size onenis big and full of cold cuts. They are fresh and cheese tasty but that's about it. It lacked flavor combinations and just tasted like a bunch of cold cuts slapped together. The roast beef was very under seasoned. The cashier misheard one of my orders. No big deal but I asked if there was a difference in price as in I have to pay more or get money back since not every sandwich is priced right. The manager seemed to be really offended by my asking and told her it's like 50 cents or 75 cents coming back to me. I said it was fine and keep it as tip. The manager over heard me again and told her to give it back to me since it's not his money to keep. Not really sure why he was upset but it seemed he really want to make a point to me. When she try to hand the change I told her to put it in the tip bucket. A large sandwich does not make a sandwich great.

Their extensive menu consists of over 150 sandwiches, each uniquely named after various famous Italians, and deciding on which one(s) to order was overwhelmingly  tough given the many choices.. We ordered two sandwiches-- the ""Christopher Columbo"" (roast beef, sopressata, lioni fresh mozzarella, sausage, mushrooms and topping mix) and the ""Joe Paterno"" (grilled chicken, fried eggplant, honey mustard, and lioni fresh mozzarella), and it took us two evenings to finish them because the portions were so huge (and we obviously couldn't just settle on ordering one sandwich, because they all sounded so good!)  Both sandwiches were delicious (and they were still very good the next day--right out of the fridge w/o any reheating).

Lioni Italian Heroes,5571,7803 15th Ave,Brooklyn,11228.0,2852,"I've had this place bookmarked as a place to try but for some reason I never got around to going. All that changed last night when my girlfriend and I decided that it was too late to cookand sandwiches would do the trick. I asked Google for a suggestion for Italian subs and Lioni's came up. Thank you Google, this place is unbelievable. It's strictly subs, they list 150 + combinations, and sides so don't go there looking for plates of Ravioli or Ziti, Papa Pasquale's which seems to offer more Italian dishes, and who I'm going to try next week, is about 8 doors down the street. Anyway back to Lioni's, it's a really cool place with loads of with signs all over the place with the names of Italian celebs, as a matter of fact, all the sandwiches are all named after famous Italians such as the Tony Siragusa, Sicilian salami,Genoa salami, ham, their signature LIONI Fresh Mozz and hot or sweet stuffed peppers. Once you decide, you order by number.  I ordered a #25, Hot capicola, salami, pepperoni, swiss, provolone, stuffed peppers and deli mustard. My girlfriend got a #49, an Italian sausage & pepper. This place is the real deal folks, even with all the layers of flavors, my sandwich was unbelievable. Don't go there expecting Subway prices or 4 or even 6 in. subs, My Louie Prima was $15.00 and my girlfriend's Sylvester Stallone was $10.00  but both were huge, so big that we were only able to eat half last night and the rice balls and stuffed peppers didn't get touched. My step daughter teaches in the area and she advises that during lunch hour you call your order in because the lines are outrageous. Also the sandwich menu is 7 pages so I'd suggest that you take a look at one before you enter the store.

Those kind of sandwiches.I bring every Brooklyn first-timer here to give them a taste of how it felt to grow up Italian in my now, predominantly Chinese neighborhood. It's a relic, a glimpse into a time when you couldn't walk down the streets without hearing a ""FUGGHEDABOUTIT"" or an ""EY, OH."" Just one bite of their fresh mozzarella, roasted pepper and chicken cultet sub will transport you to a time where the alleys smelled of fresh basil flowers and small, incredibly mean grandmas would push their grocery carts, unapologetically running over any street cats that got in their way. There are about a million sandwich options to choose from, as well as ready made food like rice balls and potato croquettes. Their proscuitto bread is also worth grabbing, warm it up in the oven and go in. Get one for yourself. Get a whole loaf. Go crazy. The sandwich menu can become overwhelming, so give it a look before you go. They're all named after famous people which is pretty cool because you're like ""HA, I'm eating Alyssa Milano right now, everybody! Look! NOM, NOM! Get in my mouth, Alyssa Milano!"" I ask for my subs untoasted because they tend to toast the warm subs whether you ask for it or not; I prefer not to have the roof of my mouth scraped off. If you choose otherwise, that's on you.If you're planning a visit, make sure to go early, during lunch hours, as they run out of the good bread (anything not whole wheat. Who actually picks whole wheat sub rolls if they don't actually have to?) pretty early, as they're always busy. The subs are relatively expensive, but you should note that they can be split between two people. They really are enormous and Lioni's doesn't skimp on the good stuff between the bread.

If you don't like anything on the menu (what is wrong with you though, seriously?) they'll make you whatever you want. 2. At first glance, you may think wtf why am I paying $15 for a sandwich. And then you get it and your realize it is literally on an entire loaf of Italian bread. When I order from Lioni, I eat 1/4 for lunch, 1/4 for dinner (maybe another 1/4 if there is drinking or football involved in my night) and a 1/4 for lunch the next day.

I tell you, anything with fresh mozzarella changes my world.Since we have come to an agreement that we would never share a sandwich, we both ordered one each, and when it came out, I knew it would feed us for days! The menu was extensive, going up to a whopping 75 different sandwiches! I was a bit overwhelmed and it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. #69 - Alyssa Milano: Chicken cutlet, prosciutto di parma, LIONI FRESH MOZZARELLA, and basil mix#59 - John Franco: Prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, LIONI FRESH MOZZARELLA, olive oil, salt, pepper and oregano OMG. Once I unwrapped the sandwich, the mozzarella was literally goozing out of it and my heart literally melted. Let's just say that the boyfriend and I were happy for days. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars because the prosciutto di parma was a bit too salty for my liking.

I decided since I was missing out on some fresh roast beef from this broad that eating some of Lioni's roast beef was appropriate. I checked on number 69, which seemed appropriate given the scenario I was in but I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment to such a decadent sandwich. I decided to keep it simple and got number 90.

Did he really memorized all those combos or was there a sheet with him...HUGE hero/sandwich. Not your standard subway (11-12 inch). It was probably 12-14 inches. What I recommend is anything with their fresh mozzarella, imported prosciutto, and specialty meats. I was especially fond of the smoked mozzarella. Stay away from the stuff that you can grab just anywhere. I really should bring home some of their olive/sun-dried tomato bread next time. Looked pretty good and freshly made. No tax! Spare some change for the tip jar (which hopefully goes to everyone). Tip: They're pretty big. Maybe it's because of the bread. The price range is $8-15, with most of them averaging 11-13.

Lioni Italian Heroes,5571,7803 15th Ave,Brooklyn,11228.0,6655,"2007, I had a business in Tampa and I was looking to move my family to Clearwater Beach. I met with a realtor and he's showing us around. I'm getting ready to leave and I'm about to grab a bite. He says, you have to try ""Dominicks"", these guys are from New York! I walk in, they didn't have Boars Head, they had Smores Head. On white bread?! I walked out and said never contact me again. Folks, this is Brooklyn! The hipsters haven't spread to this area yet, there are still Italian delis holding it down. I would have loved to say I came here as a kid, but this is a long way from Canarsie. I heard about this place from my Yelp brothers, two heroes on patrol. They hit this place up and man, I locked in. I think about if the hipsters did come to the area, I can hear their conversation: Bro, we got a call. Wait a second, lemme finish up my truffle fries. ahahahahaLioni Italian Heroes is just that, Heroes. Not grinders. Not Subs like in Florida. Hero.And what Lioni Italian Heroes is making is total New York/Brooklyn in the house Heroes.First, there are 200 sandwich combinations. Before you come, go to the website and find out what type of combination you're looking to order. If you have people behind you and you start hemming and hawing, people are gonna get antsy. This is NY, choose fast!Secondly, the bread they're using is perfection. It's not too hard where you'll get full from eating an entire loaf of bread and its not too soft where you're holding a sloppy mess. Its a freshly made in Brooklyn Italian bread.Then there's the mozzarella. Mozzarella is a sacred thing, its not cut out of a Polly-O bag. This is freshly made cheese. And they also sell a smoked version to add to your sandwich creation! I love a good Italian Meat Combo with cheese. Today, I'm in Brooklyn. I want something that my uncles would have made in the back yard. (The cement backyard, hahaha) So I chose a spicy sausage with mozzarella and bruschetta sandwich. I give my order to the counter person and off he goes. Now this isn't a typical Long Island crap deli where they make the hero in record time! I'm looking for perfection, no reason to rush them. When it comes out, its comes out. Relax. After, I'd say 5 minutes pass my sandwich is ready. I take it to the front and have a seat. I unwrap this sucka and this thing is a weapon! Holy Moley!

Onto the review..Once you step into this place you step into old school Brooklyn. The Brooklyn that doesn't exist anymore but brings warmth to your heart when you see places like this that have withstood time and change. Do your homework before you head out to this place as they have 100+ sandwich combos and don't have time for you to be standing there staring up at the menu board. You don't necessarily have to get what they have on their menu and they'll make pretty much anything you ask for but when you see what they make you'll probably change your mind.On my last visit I had the 111 which is the Leonardo DiCaprio. Imagine about 10 pounds of hero. Roast beef, fried eggplant, American cheese, mozzarella, bruschetta, and stuffed peppers on a full loaf of Brooklyn Italian bread. ARE YOU SERIOUS! Food coma is all I can say to describe this sandwich. I ate the whole hero in one day for both lunch and dinner. Don't expect to eat the whole thing in one sitting unless your a competitive eater.This isn't fast food so do be prepared to wait for one of the artists to whip up your sandwich.

Portions were very tiny as well, a $25 plate of spinach ravioli had 5 medium sized raviolis on the plate and came with nothing else. The chicken dish had more breading on it than meat, the lobster pasta did not taste fresh.

Liola Ristorante,5572,15-01 149th St,Whitestone,11357.0,4277,"In the spirit of spontaneity, we abandoned our plans to have dinner at a nearby restaurant when we happened to drive by Liola. We were distracted by the restaurant's quaint facade and endearing twinkle lights and made the unprecedented decision to dine at Liola without checking it's Yelp reviews. I very much agree with Kim M's review. The restaurant is lovely . But, this restaurant clearly caters to the neighborhood and it's regulars who have clearly been coming here for years. The clientele is definitely on the older side -- people who have been coming for years and will continue to do so. The service is alright, especially given that the restaurant doesn't seem to get particularly busy and who's loyal customers don't seem like the sort to be complaining about anything. The menu is no frills and very standard, as is the food. Calamari tasted unseasoned and bland. My shrimp ravioli was alright. We ordered the hot antipasti which was definitely the best dish of the night. They should make the oysters rockefeller that was included a regular item because it was outstanding. But, my fiancee ordered a pasta special: the tagliatelle with parmesan, porcini mushrooms and truffles that we were confused by. It was lovely to watch them toss the pasta in the parmesan wheel a table over, and we enjoyed the showmanship! It tasted great as well, but I was taken aback at the $55 price tag. I realize that truffles are pricey but did not see any shaved over the dish. There's a risotto dish on the regular menu using the same ingredients at only $27. Perhaps it is our own fault for not asking the price of the special beforehand, but I think we would have benefited from a heads up from our server, as we have never spent that much for a pasta dish and will not be doing so again.In any case, a lesson was learned: check Yelp reviews to avoid disappointment!",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,10.6999998093,"restaurant,decision,restaurant,spontaneity,plans,dinner,spirit,restaurant,Liola,facade,twinkle lights,regulars,people,antipasti,item,tagliatelle,oysters,reviews,review,neighborhood,service,menu,Yelp,dish,frills,food,clientele,shrimp ravioli,risotto dish,customers,truffles,parmesan,Liola,side,anything,sort,dish,rockefeller,fiancee,pasta special,mushrooms,Kim M,fault,menu,price,ingredients,pasta dish,Calamari,server,lesson,case,reviews,disappointment,heads,pasta,truffles,table,parmesan wheel,price tag,showmanship,again.In","2,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,5,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.208835050464,0.0799224227667,0.07014785707,0.0491759553552,0.0491759553552,0.0491759553552,0.0491759553552,0.033730391413,0.0334442220628,0.0235571675003,0.0235571675003,0.0226523559541,0.0189455393702,0.0181033536792,0.0165551546961,0.0138592589647,0.0107751013711,0.0103123867884,0.0102596506476,0.00892113428563,0.00839608535171,0.00838191155344,0.00792028382421,0.00786433089525,0.00742847193033,0.00742847193033,0.00736179854721,0.00713150715455,0.00638716993853,0.00631189951673,0.00622641248628,0.00622641248628,0.00611091358587,0.00601188652217,0.00600016210228,0.00600016210228,0.00549092516303,0.00545378401875,0.0054482575506,0.0054482575506,0.0054482575506,0.00531977647915,0.00502876751125,0.00463709840551,0.00463374145329,0.00410903571174,0.00379694253206,0.00354215479456,0.00320870429277,0.00280733266845,0.00280733266845,0.00280733266845,0.00280733266845,0.00280733266845,0.00224227365106,0.0019108596025,0.00178419426084,0.00178419426084,0.00178263394628,0.00176171108615,0.0016618425725"

Liola Ristorante,5572,15-01 149th St,Whitestone,11357.0,39543,"So we decided to try Liola after the 4pm Christmas Eve mass at St. Mel's.  Since it was so early, we lucked out and got the best table right by the fireplace.  Our luck essentially stopped there.  We were very disappointed with the limited menu.  For an Italian restaurant they have about 5 pasta selections on the menu and two of those are ravioli...not a fave of mine.  I really was looking for some shrimp options but all they had was shrimp ravioli and a shrimp cocktail.  The bread was good. The olives were a nice touch but the food was just not good.  We ordered a mixed salad to share with avocado.  It was just okay. It lacked pizazz and was served with corn kernels which reminded me of a Charlie Brown's buffet salad...something that definitely doesn't carry a $12 price tag.I ordered the eggplant with spaghetti.  It came and looked like a mini pile on the plate.  The spaghetti was mixed in the eggplant.  I get more ""presentation"" out of a Celentano box.  Absolutely nothing to bite.  Best suggestion for patrons without choppers and who don't require anything to be tasty.My partner ordered the shrimp ravioli and was disappointed in the presentation and taste.  I took a bite and it smelled fishy.  An immediate turn off.  The service was fine but a bit disorganized in that three different people waiter, maitre d and bus asked us if we wanted coffee and dessert.  Obviously we couldn't wait to get our check and head for the hills.  It's so funny because when we walked out we both commented that Carvel was open and maybe we should go there for dessert.  We didn't but had we, it would have been the dining highlight of the evening.  Coming here to Yelp this morning, I happen to notice another review that mentions the same comment about leaving Liola and looking at Carvel.  Should've checked out Yelp first.We really wanted to like this place because the room is so nice but unfortuanately no love found in the food.",2.0 star rating,"Beechhurst, NY",2,0,0.0,10.5,"pasta selections,Liola,mass,menu,Christmas Eve,St. Mel's,presentation,something,fireplace,luck,table,bite,corn kernels,shrimp ravioli,mine,fave,two,restaurant,shrimp options,shrimp cocktail,food,spaghetti,bread,review,salad,shrimp ravioli,buffet salad,spaghetti,eggplant,eggplant,partner,taste,touch,avocado,pizazz,price tag.,pile,plate,box,nothing,choppers,patrons,suggestion,Italian,dessert,Liola,tasty.My,Charlie Brown,room,dining highlight,Celentano,food,place,comment,love,Carvel,anything,olives,Yelp,check,service,dessert,bus,coffee,maitre d,bit,hills,people waiter","7,7,4,7,4,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,2,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,1,7,1,2,4,1,7,7,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,1","0.113706745207,0.0781238973141,0.0696472972631,0.0486159101129,0.0414564833045,0.0414564833045,0.0386451818049,0.0350909270346,0.0333240143955,0.0331541784108,0.024619853124,0.0216075256467,0.0214539393783,0.0168361030519,0.0126112801954,0.0126112801954,0.0126112801954,0.0126112801954,0.0125822136179,0.0125822136179,0.0115525126457,0.0114817293361,0.0101261828095,0.0100770322606,0.00966155342758,0.00964985974133,0.00963703263551,0.00963703263551,0.00963703263551,0.00961666647345,0.00940591748804,0.00877769477665,0.00846659205854,0.00845396984369,0.00843250844628,0.00843250844628,0.00842321943492,0.00842321943492,0.00769341178238,0.00768669042736,0.00768040819094,0.00768040819094,0.00768040819094,0.00747049180791,0.00653636269271,0.00530690979213,0.00519792316481,0.00499336700886,0.00484192278236,0.0046076066792,0.00455542141572,0.00451824488118,0.00405450724065,0.00395512301475,0.00395298982039,0.00394360674545,0.00377687742002,0.00366800720803,0.00329837226309,0.00323461694643,0.0029995914083,0.00287089962512,0.00251162820496,0.00251162820496,0.00251162820496,0.00251162820496,0.00250999489799,0.00199897703715"

Lion Pavilion Hot Pot,5573,136-76 39th Ave,Flushing,11354.0,138562,"Hotpot is one of those foods I am never tired of eating. Little sheep on 37th avenue is one of my favorite places to eat but can get a bit pricey with their a la carte menu. However, I always leave with a full stomach and am very satisfied with everything. Lion Pavilion on the other hand leaves your wallet empty, belly hungry, and is disappointing. Their prices are higher than that of other local hotpot places and the portions are so small. The restaurant itself is small and it is hard to accommodate larger parties. I went with my family (total of 6 of us) and squeezed uncomfortably in a small booth, clearly for four people. There was a bigger table but it was already occupied. Onto the food. We ordered the half spicy/half mild pot, a bunch of meats, veggies, and noodles. I didn't like that they charge you by head. I think it was around $3-4/person for just the hotpot soup. We didn't really like their spicy soup base especially since there was a thick layer of oil on it. That combined with the super fatty beef screams heart attack at the dinner table. In all my years of eating hotpot, I have never gotten such unappetizing fatty beef before. We ordered regular beef but it was more than 70% fat (totally inedible). When we asked the waiter, he told us that this is the beef they have. We also ordered lamb which was better but not great. It has a gamey taste unlike the lamb from little sheep which doesn't have that taste at all. In the end, the bill for the 6 of us was around $260 with tax and tip. My parents were hungry an hour later and ate beef noodles. In short, save your money, walk across the parking lot and go to little sheep Mongolian hotpot.

The business claimed their interior design is one of a kind -- the table is in green glass and the interior color is yellow -- I don't see the ambience or setting is too attractive.Hot pot base - 4. I ordered the dual hot pot base (original + spicy). I really love the spicy one because I totally love the feeling of getting my tongue numb! It tastes different than other spicy soup bases from Little Sheep or other well known hot pot places. Highly recommend spicy soup base.Dipping sauce: dipping sauce bar is self service. I cant say it is perfect but it has a good selection.Food - 3.5: most of ingredients are fresh, but the portion of some orders are incredibly small. For example, we ordered the wide glass noodles in small portion. What comes is really small -- maybe just 5 pieces.Service - 2 : service is always a headache for most Chinese restaurants. I'm assuming this place is new, the staff is learning how to do good customers service and run the operations of the restaurant. When our table asked for water, the staff told us to get them ourselves, but the water is running out. When we asked for napkins, the staff told us to get them ourselves. When we asked for extra glasses for the juices, the staff told us to finish the water and pour the juices because they are running out of glasses. When the busser brought dishes, she was complaining she was super tired. When we asked what kind of meat was served, the lady who was serving is like I don't know... I mean I don't blaim them because they are new and I can tell they are good kids. When I come back next time I probably would rate this higher.

Ambiance: Cute decorations suitable for the holidays but horrible inappropriate music. During my visit they played IDFWU by Big Sean and Nicki Minaj all uncensored with my ten year old sister sitting next to me. The music detracts from the friendly atmosphere. Cleanliness: overall pretty clean, but there were some flies hanging around by the sauce station that found their way to our table. Service: Very slow, my parents suspect it's because of poor management and organization. The kitchen staff kept peering out at us the entire time and I felt highly uncomfortable. The staff didn't look over our table to clear plates or refill water. However, the food came pretty quickly (granted, we came at a slow time) Also, when we notified the waiter that our corn platter was rotten, he took no action and argued with us that their ingredients were good. Who does that? Miscellaneous: the plates were too small. The soup bowls we were given were too small to place any of the hot pot ingredients in.AND NOW FOR THE FOODSoup: the spicy base is actually pretty good. Very spicy but doesn't have the typical spices that would be thrown into a hotpot in flushing (no cardamom, spice balls that would usually be found). The clear white base was subpar at best. It wasn't aromatic and tasted extremely bland. Not very impressed with the white base. The ingredients: not very fresh at all. The corn pieces were tiny (and we were given a rotten piece). The udon we ordered came in a frozen block and came out rubbery and sad. The meat were all fatty and were cut too thick. The sauce bar: the most redeeming quality of the place. Crushed peanuts were something I haven't seen before, very happy about this. Many options and good choices. In addition to soy sauce, I was happy to see sesame paste, chive paste, chili powder and chili paste.

My only downside which is pretty big to me is that their veggies aren't fresh. At all. Vegetables play a vital part in hotpot. You can't just have meat and noodles and be done.

At About 1050pm they served some food and said that's the only food we had left because the kitchen is closed already. We were complaining about why you didn't ask us whether you guys need more food or not before the kitchen closed. the waiter had really really bad attitude.we asked him why you gave us that attitude he was like so angry without a reason. We argued a little bit he was even about to HIT US !!!!!! All the other waiter were trying to stop him so hard. That was so crazy.

The storefront exterior is a bold blue color that's hard to miss, and the interior design had a lot of noteworthy details to enjoy and pay attention to. Both the pistachio and original flavored baklava pieces were succulent-- I ate some inside the cafe and also took some for the road, too.

Today he was giving me a new look, an 'invisible' look, and left me stranded without even asking (thanks to there's no one else but an un-welcomed CUPS guest). He knows that I want simple hot coffee as always, just one press does the job, but he is suddenly occupied with his busy work cleaning steam pipes.

Lion’s Milk,5574,104 Roebling St,Brooklyn,11211.0,27056,Why is this place rated so highly?Upon walking in I loved how they sold artisanal pastas (squid ink pasta) and some Turkish goodies. But I paid $22 for two sandwiches and two cortados. Very steep. Even for this neighborhood. This is a classic case of small portions being sold for double the price. The coffee was good (they use coffee from Devociòn) but slightly bitter and stale compared to how I've had it at Devociòn.My major problem is how incredibly small their sandwiches are. Nowhere does it say legibly that their sandwiches are on MINI baguettes. Charging $7.50 for a sandwich that's a quarter size of what it should be?! I've been to so many Turkish restaurants/cafes and Turkish homes and I'm kind of sad that their portion sizes are like this. My best friend is Turkish and I would've loved to take her here to a place that's close by me but I just can't get over how overpriced this sandwich is. Delicious albeit but you could make it at home for half the price.

If you come to eat here, definitely order the clam with scallion oil (I don't actually know what it is, but it's so fresh and tasty. It might be called 葱油蛏子), braised fish with scallion pancakes (红烧鱼饼子), and some typical northern dishes like savory eggplant, potato and green pepper (地三鲜). Service: food came fast. The owner, his wife and waiters there are very nice. Typical hardworking Chinese people that work from morning to midnight, 365 days. I heard the owners never rushes the diners even if it's way past their closing time at midnight. And I feel unfair for them because some Yelper gave them a very low rating because they don't speak too much English. Learn some Chinese man if u don't have to work 365 days a year.Environment: they did some renovation recently and it's Ok.

The atmosphere in the windowed area is luminous and pleasant, and it overlooks the intersection of Broadway and Steinway--great for people-watching. They do not blast loud, obnoxious music through the speakers (more easy listening/soft rock), so you can actually have a conversation with people without screaming.

On the one hand, their Caribbean French Toast (a special, usually on Saturdays) is incredibly good, I've never had to wait to be seated, the prices are right and there's this one really great waitress.On the other hand, the other waitresses are much less great. It might not be all of them but just the one I end up getting stuck with much more often than I'd like. She usually forgets at least one part of the order and then cops an attitude when you remind her about it. Whenever I ask for some water, the prospect of getting it seems to stress her out.While the fresh orange juice is good, I find their smoothies lacking in flavor. And the curly fries always look so good on some one else's plate but are kinda bland and disappointing whenever I get them.Despite its problems, I find myself coming back for that french toast or a a tasty toasted bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomato and onion.

I guess it would depend on your views on McDonald's.It would have been cheaper and I knew what I was getting would be to my enjoyment.This review is based on ONE TIME BREAKFAST meal and service.Perhaps after checking out the reviews I was just looking for ""easy"" breakfast, and being they fit the diner look, I went in with knowing it was just going to be OK, but they couldn't even get that.I ordered the Mexican Omelet because it came with sour cream and salsa. Robert got The Big Mess. Robert had no complaints, and thought it was pretty decent. He was looking for something more ""messy"" since it was in the name, but to be honest, he was wearing a white shirt so I'm glad it was well put together.The Mexican Omelet yelp.com/biz_photos/lite… was really dry, and I wouldn't have mind it so much had the sour cream and salsa come with it. Which it didn't, and when I asked the host for it (because our server was MIA) he look confused, said he'd ask, and brought back sour cream and salsa hot sauce; not what I was expecting. Perhaps I was thinking, diced tomato-cilantro-onion-chips-N-salsa kind of salsa, not just a hot sauce condiment. I would have asked again, but like I said, server totally MIA. The service was way under par. We had to wait 10 minutes to order our food, and 2 other tables had the same problem. No one could find a server.  We were actually thinking of walking out and finding another place to go, but she ended up appearing. The food arrived in a timely manner, but we never saw her again. Seriously. Totally Davie Blane sh!t. She wasn't even there to drop off our check.  We had to find the another server all together.I think my first experience was enough for me to know that I won't be going back.

Although I've had other things on the menu, I typically have gone for brunch at any hour.  You can custom any order you have and don't resist their curly fries (I always replace home fries with the curly fries. Home fries are yummy too)The thing about it that I love is that it is usually quick to get a table (don't let the long line out the door fool you), it's pretty cheap compared to other brunch places, food is good, and our usual waitress (is it Shelly?

It was very thoughtful of her.  Looking back, I probably would have been really uncomfortable in the sunny seat. We both played it safe and ordered from the breakfast menu, but marveled at the vast number of choices and affordable prices listed on the menu. My dining companion ordered two eggs, english muffin dry, and tomato slices. Note: they do not poach eggs.  I ordered a ham and cheese omelette which came with whole wheat toast and steak fries. I also ordered a smoothie.  A few minor errors on the order, no biggie. Everything was comfortable, diner-quality food. And I would like to rave about my steak fries, I rarely enjoy this cut of fry, but these were spot on.  We like the hot sauce in a squeeze bottle too (my friend is a fan of the hot sauce). My smoothie was also very delicious. I would like to point out that the server we had that day, was so VERY kind.  She was attentive, accommodating, and cheerful.  The woman assisting her was of the same caliber.  Four stars for these two women and their attitudes!!Not the same for the woman working the counter and register - bad news bear and sour grapes wrapped into one.  I left after paying almost not wanting to go back because of the interaction I had with her.  I don't think she even said thank you.  It was then that I understood the other reviews.  We will go back and just steel ourself against anymore interactions with the counter.",3.0 star rating,"ASTORIA, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,11.0,"yelpers,dining experience,service reviews,Lite Bites & Grill,friend,friend,Space,Everything,lunch rush,omelette,patio,sun,women,server,table,steak fries,steak fries,breakfast menu,menu,eggs,eggs,smoothie,hot sauce,woman,seat,number,choices,prices,tomato slices,english muffin,dining companion,Note,wheat toast,cheese,ham,biggie,order,errors,fry,squeeze bottle,cut,same,woman,counter,caliber,stars,attitudes,news bear,grapes,interaction,reviews,interactions,counter,server,smoothie,hot sauce","1,7,7,6,1,1,2,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7","0.0818600356579,0.0818600356579,0.0691844671965,0.0626726970077,0.0528960637748,0.050399877131,0.0477005951107,0.0393485203385,0.0392029546201,0.0279624462128,0.0218314994127,0.0182909741998,0.0171504318714,0.0148898856714,0.0148857738823,0.013436883688,0.012245349586,0.0114089837298,0.0114089837298,0.0113897128031,0.0113727413118,0.0113438842818,0.0106062535197,0.0102847218513,0.0100028095767,0.00998330209404,0.00998330209404,0.00998330209404,0.00996643397957,0.00996643397957,0.00996643397957,0.00995157845318,0.00993830896914,0.00993830896914,0.00993830896914,0.00991538818926,0.00991538818926,0.00991538818926,0.00905646104366,0.00904855038971,0.00894247088581,0.00769939646125,0.00769939646125,0.00769939646125,0.006741033867,0.00673665339127,0.00673665339127,0.00673665339127,0.00673665339127,0.00532817980275,0.00532203912735,0.00531916879117,0.00531916879117,0.00444427924231,0.00404529832304,0.00339009356685"

Also, I am still forever partial to my Russian street cart egg and cheese sandwiches that pretty much make the world still revolve around for me. This wasn't bad. But the roll I found to be a little flimsy and could have been sturdier if that makes any sense at all. Maybe I'm just being overly picky. Her boyfriend's taco salad looked 'interesting'. But to each ones own for liking bbq chicken on salad. The winning part of it all were the fries. Those were really great.

How else can I explain how Lite Bites became perhaps the most disappointing dinner in a weak of dinners not up to snuff?The waitress opened with the line ""hurry up and order, the grill closes in 10 minutes."" okay, fair enough. It was late, but not that close to closing. fast forward to the end of our dinner, and the same waitress tells the same thing to the next table that comes in. She was in such a rush to get us out of there. She came by in the middle of dinner to drop off our check as if to say ""don't even think about ordering anything else."" I should also note, she left off part of our order, as the hot chocolate never came out. My wrap had that shady lettuce in it.

I'm like... ""that's everything"" and she has said ""and what else?""She's not paying attention.Now, the thing that gets me is I order from all over Astoria.  Sometimes a lot of Chinese food and japanese food where many of the workers have thick accents and English was never the first language they spoke.  I never get my orders wrong when it comes to my method of payment.  So, I don't get why in particular this is a routine problem with Lite Bites when everyone sounds like they were at least born here.  It's like, there's something wrong upstairs.I wrote the manager before about this.  But nobody makes the order takers behave responsibly.   Before my problem was sometimes the delivery guys would drop my receipt on the street with all my credit card information written on it.  I went to work one day and saw my receipt on the street and I was so p*ssed.  I called Lite Bites and asked them if they could figure out another way of dealing with payments rather than hand write them on receipt slips.  I even saved slipped and mailed them to the manager proving that they kept writing down the wrong numbers.It's just sloppiness.  Lite Bites... get your act together.  Buy better software so customer's banking identities are up for grabs.  Tell your phone order takers to stop rushing the phone orders and listen to your customers.I swear... I'm over it.  And I have PERFECT diction.  I'm only writing this because, of course today, I got the phone call...

Lite Bites,5578,31-91 Steinway St,Astoria,11103.0,5856,"Lite Bites is one of the more reliable breakfast spots in Astoria, Queens. Although the restaurant is by no means limited to making breakfast alone,most of the other sandwiches, salads and general dishes are adequate at best. In my opinion, the other meals just don't stack up  against what you can find in the neighborhood. I think the salads there can be a bit overpriced, and again the sandwiches, wraps and paninis are just average for the most part. In short, I'm not rushing there to buy lunch or dinner at any given time because in the past I've always been burnt when buying something other than breakfast. As breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day, you can do much worse than going Lite Bites.

The diner was practically empty, so it seemed strange for her to be telling a party of five with a baby to go wait longer. While we were making our way back to the front (slowly because of the baby) she came back at us and told us impatiently, ""I said wait in the front"". So I finally turned to her and looked at her, and she said, ""it's going to be a 5 to 10 minute wait, is that okay?"" Looking around at the empty tables, I said ""nope, it's not.

On one occasion, I asked for a refill and they never brought me one.

I defended them because I thought they were actually a fine place with friendly, helpful staff.What happened? Seriously. Did it get taken over by a bunch of fifth graders? It has been so terrible lately that I can't even complete a thought.I've done pick-up orders for the past five years. All good... except the past five months. Items missing, being charged wrong, raw chicken, the cooks forgetting to cook the food I called about an hour previously, etc etc. Today, I've reached my limit. I called this morning and ordered a turkey club sandwich on whole wheat bread. I get there, I get my bag, I pay, I come home. I open the bag... it's an egg wrap with cheese and peppers.... I call them and tell them about the mistake and they say, ""oh, well you weren't specific about the turkey club. that's the turkey breakfast special""... yeah, so, every turkey club ever has consisted of peppers, eggs and cheese, right? "" come back and prove to us that there is no turkey in it"" - NO JOKE. They told me to bring back my food that they screwed up the order of and PROVE to them that they screwed up the order. I come back with the food and I'm friendly to them and even apologize for the whole situation. I give back the wrap and then get a lecture from an employee about the differences in ordering lunch and breakfast, like I'm a feral child who just left the house for the first time. Fine, whatever, I just want my food.I wait a bit and the woman finally displays my actual order... ""This is what you wanted, right?"" and it's the club sandwich. Yes. That's what I've wanted all along. She then charges me the difference in price for their mistake. No compensation whatsoever, no admission of screwing up. I was paying the difference for their mistake. She even got pissed when I used my credit card, stating that there was a limit. I'm not going to take money out of your crazily-fee'd store ATM, because you screwed up my order and are making me pay for it. No. That's not how things work.She finally agrees to let me pay with my card and I go home with my turkey club sandwich. I'm starving at this point. I rip open the container and just begin eating the sandwich.... but... it's a little funny. Doesn't taste right. Oh, look, the turkey is PINK. The sandwich is completely pink. The sandwich looks like bubblegum on bread. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't even be able to dismiss it as raw, he would have a heart attack and die at the sight of it. It was so inedible.

Lite Bites,5579,700 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,6932,"I've given them numerous chances to improve their service and the most recent interaction has proven they will never do so.Today I ordered waffles and the California fruit salad as well as a lentil soup for my sick girlfriend. The total was 26 on my grub hub, when the order arrived i thanked the delivery guy and gave him 30. Apparently they were out of lentil soup and had subtracted it from my order without calling to see if perhaps I would like something else, the delivery guy knew this and instead of telling me the total or that they were out of soup gladly took the $8 tip and hustled down the stairs. I called to let the girl know as soon as I noticed  I hadn't received my soup she told me they only had chicken noodle. out of almost a dozen soups on the menu the only one available was chicken noodle!  Well ok I'll take the chicken noodle I suppose. She says she will send it and I hang up. I go to open the Cali fruit salad this salad is two different types of melon a couple slices of strawberry some red jello and cottage cheese. And California fruit salad is typically citrus fruits and mango and such but ok I can deal, but wait they've decided to sprinkle nuts all over the top but that we're not listed on the menu  and I have a severe food allergy so time to call back again. This time I sit on hold for seven minutes the same girl answers the phone I explain that the fruit salad had nuts.

I'm watching the man ""make"" my wrap. After he puts his gloves on (to prepare my wrap) he decides to grab his pants (sticking his hand down his Burt crack), then follows by patting his co-worker on the back. I'm in shock. He then reaches over to the veggies and sprinkles them onto my wrap. I let him finish. When my order was ""ready"", I politely told the cashier what had happened, and requested a refund. They refunded me my money but laughed at me as I walked out. Could not believe they actually let their employees touch super insanitary things with the same gloves they prepare the food with.

She is a superhero. And above juggling all of that, she is nice (will always ask how I am doing, knows how I like my coffee) and she is FAST.

Lite Bites,5579,700 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,21008,"Been here a few times and each time I say I will never go back, but after yesterday, I really mean it. I ordered an egg and cheese and I asked the woman if they had bialys and she said yes. So I ordered it on a bialy. She didn't say anything about it. Next thing I know, I am paying over $4.00 for a $3.00 sandwich. When I balked, she said a bialy is .85 extra. I said you should of told me that, as I have never paid extra for such a thing. She said those are the prices in this neighborhood. Well, I live in this neighborhood--I am not some clueless tourist. This is not what an egg and cheese costs at a deli, which is what this place essentially is. When I go to Russ & Daughters, a tasty and expensive place on the LES, they do not charge me extra for a bialy. Also, what I got at Lite Bites was not even a bialy.

Lite Bites,5579,700 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,199481,"Transfering jobs from Manhattan to the edge of Brooklyn was hard enough on my commute, but now I have to suffer through the lack of descent food as well. A coworder of mine gave me the menu to Lite Bites when I first got here. The menu looked promising and when I first called, the lady on the phone was extremely curtious and pleasant to speak to.  I was further elated when the delivery got to my job in no more than 10minutes.  But then I actually went to eat my food and I realized why it took them no time at all to deliver.  The food was HORRIBLE.  I ordered the grilled salmon entree (served with roasted red potatoes and roasted asparagus and lemmon butter sauce).  My salmon tasted as if was the worst cut of salmon grilled last week and then microwaved twice.  It was like chewing on already chewed up fish. GROSS. The red potatoes tasted as if they were grilled the day before and the asparagus (only about 6 pieces) was oily and cold.  All in all I had a terrible experience.The second time around (I'm a firm believer in 2nd chances), I had the Cajun Style Roasted Chicken.  The ""Cajun Style"" chicken was just plain dry chicken with too much pepper seasoning. The corn that it came with was right from a can.  The only descent part was the rice pilaf.  Dont even get me started on the New England Clam Chowder that I decided to try as well.  I promised myself that I'd never make the mistake of ordering from here again.Unfortunately for me, I left my lunch at home this morning.  The only menu I had at my desk was Lite bites. I pondered about airing on the side of caution and just going with a panini (since you cant mess that up), but I decided to give the salmon another shot. Idk, maybe the first experiece was because they only had 1 piece left.  Nevertheless, I wasn't surprised when my order arrived in about 10 minutes and my salmon was bone dry, potatoes were cold and oily, and my asparagus tasted like salty noodles. I'm not one to bash an entire establishment just because their entrees are terrible (eventhough I probably should).  I'm sure IF I ever order again, I'll try their sala or sandwiches that people are raving about. But all I know is that I'm staying far away from the entrees.

Lite Bites,5579,700 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,134909,"I've walked by here many times noticing Lite Bites' popularity before braving the rain to finally try it today.I got French toast with well done bacon and it was the tasty diner fare I'd expected. I can't say it was special compared to any breakfast spot anywhere. What it was, was cheap, and with amazingly quick service. The waitstaff was hustling around the joint, refilling coffee, taking orders, taking care of customers in a hurry.I rate the French toast lesser than Eat Records' but greater than Greenpoint Coffee House's. It was far more humble than either breakfast spot's offerings, but as far as home style French toast with a bit of sliced strawberry, this hit the spot for the price.The bacon was indeed crispy as I asked, which was a rare and appreciated treat. It was fattier than I'd like, but it's bacon, so what the hell, no legit complaints there.The coffee was good enough with frequent refills, and came with a little pitcher of cream and a well stocked container of real and fake sugar.Breakfast-wise, nothing special here, but totally solid if you want a cheap, traditional and notably fast breakfast between the Greenpoint and Nassau G-train stops.Apparently they deliver, so that could be a good option if you live in the area and are lacking pans, or eggs, or other basics you should really look into investing in.",3.0 star rating,"Lafayette Hill, PA",2,1,0.300000011921,3.79999995232,"popularity,bacon,bacon,rain,times,toast,breakfast,French,Lite Bites,bacon,breakfast spot,anywhere,service,coffee,toast,toast,breakfast spot,care,orders,spot,waitstaff,hurry.,customers,joint,offerings,home style,bit,strawberry,Eat Records,Greenpoint Coffee House,Breakfast-wise,eggs,pans,area,basics,Nassau G-train,coffee,complaints,container,cream,pitcher,refills,hell","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,6,7,1,7,7","0.407088249922,0.0684787854552,0.0633155032992,0.0506606698036,0.0506606698036,0.047036267817,0.0415236055851,0.038897305727,0.0302524007857,0.0264919809997,0.0117287002504,0.00934099964797,0.0092932600528,0.00785846635699,0.00785846635699,0.00783632323146,0.00783632323146,0.00737490132451,0.00737490132451,0.00717239221558,0.00625648302957,0.00625648302957,0.00625648302957,0.00625648302957,0.00623884191737,0.00623884191737,0.00623884191737,0.00623884191737,0.0037063381169,0.0037063381169,0.0034098115284,0.00294844666496,0.00294844666496,0.00294844666496,0.00294844666496,0.00252123991959,0.00234765699133,0.00223096925765,0.00186815217603,0.00186815217603,0.00186815217603,0.00186815217603,0.00186815217603"

Little Caesars Pizza,5594,84-04 Astoria Blvd,East Elmhurst,11370.0,28721,"To be honest, I love Little Cesar's pizza. Rather than paying $60-$70 for the other brand names pizzeria and wait for at least an hour for the pizza to come, I'd feel better eating the cheap, decently tasted pizza from Little Cesar's. All pizzas are equally bad for you anyway.My family of 5 was craving for pizza on a weekday night around 9pm. And we tried all the pizza hut, dominos, Papa John's etc, and they all costed at least $60 for 2 large pies and a couple of wings, not including delivery, normally another $10-$12. That's ridiculous to pay that much for pizza and wait 1.5 hours for them.We ended up going to Little Cesar's and got a large 3 meat pizza ($10), large deep dish cheese stuffed pizza ($10), and a large Hawaiian pizza ($10), 8 wings ($6), and a 2L soda, all added up to $40 including tips. No regards. We all collapsed with a carb crash with a whole pie left. If you order any speciality pizza, they'll make our pizza from stretch. It took about 15 minutes for them to make our 3 large pies and wings. But if you order the ready to go cheese ($5) or pepperoni (5.99) and cheese pizza, you take it out right away. They also have a special lunch combo, 4 slices of pepperoni and cheese personal pizza and a soda for $5.

Little Caesars Pizza,5598,114-10 Sutphin Blvd,Jamaica,11434.0,3760,"Haven't been to a Little Caesars in over 15 years. I drive past this Little Caesars every Monday thru Friday after work because the Van Wyck Expressway is just a hot mess every single day during rush hour. So lately, I been seeing more Little Caesars commercials on TV than usual. I haven't their commercial in ages because its always either Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's. Pizza - Little Caesars been advertising a deep dish pie for only $8 bucks, hot and ready to go and since I drive past this one almost every single day, I decided why not. I know I'm from New York and we got the best pizzas and all but still, the commercial sold me with its ""Pizza Pizza"" catchphrase.Anyway, from 4pm to 7pm I think, all of their pizza deals are all ""Hot-N-Ready"". There's literally no wait time. I pulled up and was out in less than a minute. When I got home, the pizza was still nice and hot, crust still crunchy too! I was pretty surprised. The tomato sauce was very robust and tasted better than Dominos. The cheese and crust were delightful.Verdict - If I had a choice between Little Caesars and all of the other Pizza chains, I would actually choose Little Caesars over the rest because Dominos is too cheap with the cheese even when you ask for extra cheese, Papa John's is so-so, Pizza Hut is extremely oily and salty but I'll admit their cheese stuffed crust is bangin, CiCi's pizza is cheap but lacks quality.

Little Caesars Pizza,5601,205-01 Linden Blvd,Saint Albans,11412.0,67245,"So glad this side of Queens has a Little Caesars and its a short walking distance from my house, BIG PLUS. I remember living in Flushing and having one there so I was hoping it lived up to its taste and I was right. My family and I come here on occasion, especially when we don't feel like cooking and we want something quick. Their hot and ready pizzas are good for those type of situations. The place is clean, the staff is extremely polite and helpful. This location gets a lot of business, it seems like every time I'm in there someone is ordering ten pies at a time. Anyways, my favorite specialty pizzas that they have are the deep deep dish and one of my new favorite the pretzel crust pizza with a cheddar cheese sauce. Now when they introduced that, their business increased dramatically as that was the favorite item on the menu.Now about their wings, you don't even though.

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,27028,"First off if you are a vegetarian, vegan, gluten free cruelty free kind of guy you should completely ignore this review. I am the kind of guy that would gladly bludgeon his dinner to death with sack of potatoes and then eat them together. That said I will also eat anything, and when this joint opened up a block from me I figured I'd go out on a limb and give it a shot. So last night I walked in, feeling like a spy, to order my crepe and juice. I opted for the seitan crepe and the 'red nose reindeer' juice. Total came to just under $20 - not cheap. But then again I am getting all home made stuff and fresh juice. I sat upstairs which is a very well done and welcoming space. The coffee shop that was in the building prior was always dark and kind of sad. They opened it up with nice lighting, a podium for fresh water, and a small art space. Because hey, if you are going to be an all vegan crepe place, gotta slap some DIY art in there. 5-10 minutes later a cheery employee dropped my food and drink off. Let's start with the positives. The juice was f***** amazing. I am never much of a juice guy outside of things I can put vodka in, but man this was perfectly balanced, fresh, light and juuuust sweet enough to not be bitter. I am definitely coming back to try their other juices and maybe a smoothy once it warms up a bit. Now the crepe was quite large, cooked to a turn and presented well. As for flavor, I guess it just isn't my thing. I can see how it could be your thing, and I'm not docking this place points due to personal preferences. I am sure if you were vegan and this was your thing you'd be raving about this place. But as a steak bacon and butter kind of guy - it was just different. Definitely coming back here for the drinks. I think it might be my first stop on the hangover express next weekend. Oh yeah, and drinking beets makes your poo pink.

Then they were looking crazy for a towel to dry it, then I simply let the cashier know it was fine and she gave it to me. Besides my little experience, I would defiantly go back!

I had enough when I saw a group of people and two other women come in and the server immediately gave them a menu. I was livid by then so I stared at him and caught his eye.

It is a bit far from everything but it is worth visiting this tiny restaurant even for those who aren't vegan (neither I am). It is not cheap but I think it worth the money. If you go there don't miss the upper level of the restaurant where you can sit down and you can calmly eat your food. We had 2 savoury crepes (Khail Seitan and a Garden of Eatin'), one sweet (banana with 'newtella') and a chocolate mud cake. The cake wasn't out of this world, it was too crumbly. The Garden of Eatin was also really good but the Khail Seitan was the bomb!! It was exactly like a sausage-stuffed pancake with a very delicious sauce.

And they didn't bring a spoon with my tea so I had to stir with a fork. None of this is too bad. But..We ordered and got our drinks, and after an entire hour (!!) the waiter asked us ""Are you waiting for something?"" Uhh... we're waiting for our food?

With a good amount of outlets around and also free wifi, a lot of people were working on their laptop. Seems to be the perfect spot to get work done and enjoy some tea.The newtella was delicious and not overly sweet. I would want to try their savory crepes next time when I'm not on a full stomach. My cappuccino had a beautiful bird on it, almost too cute to drink. The matcha tea latte was a little strong for my friend but the agave they have handy on the table gave it the bit of sweetness she needed. Both the matcha tea latte and the iced mocha were also served in glass jars. I did however, take one star off because of the fruit flies that were constantly flying around. I think it is because of the bin they place on the table for the used juice jars and plates.Nonetheless, this is the place I would come back again and again to try more of their menu.

The vegan crepes were enjoyed by all four of us, even our persnickety eater. Our service was very good but as the restaurant became more crowded, the service for the new arrivals slowed down, unfortunately for them. When we exited the restaurant, we noticed that our waitress, perhaps the only table waiter, was also washing dishes!

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,12024,"Cute vegan spot in the middle of Williamsburg. The first floor is the cafe where you can order and simultaneously watch the baristas make fresh crepes and sweets. Their menu include crepes (both savory and sweets), various cookies/scones that changes daily, coffee (from toby's estate) and tea. You have to order here before you walk upstairs to the dine-in area. We decided to order 3 crepes and went upstairs.The cafe upstairs is quiet and has huge windows to allow the natural lighting to seep through (perfect for studying). They also offer free water on tap. The wait for your crepes was pretty long (about 20-30 minutes) even though there seem to be no wait whatsoever. However, it was worth the wait. Here was what we ordered.Khail Seitan: A good amount of seitan (for the protein buffs). The seitan tasted like meatballs with the BBQ saucePizza Crepe (+Coconut bacon): OMG. Give me more! Everything from their cashew cheese to smoky coconut bits tasted absolutely amazing. Definitely our favorite.Sweet crepes with Newtella, strawberry, & clotted cream: Did not taste as indulgent as we thought. Hazelnut flavor was strong and the clotted cream was a delicious addition.Would I come here again? Most definitely. My boyfriend and I were fighting for the last piece of the pizza crepe and contemplated if we should order another one. The crepes here also did not taste as heavy as other crepe shops (made us feel not as guilty for indulging). The only downside was the wait for crepes was long and the lack of ice cream (I asked for a crepe to be a la mode and they didn't have any at the time).

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,72102,"EXTREMELY disappointed. We went there with my boyfriend Sunday. The weather was beautiful, our day was amazing, until we got to that place. The place looks cute but kind of depressing at the same time. Trying to be classy/French with this really depressing music with violon, not much light in the store. ANYWAY- I was excited to come for the pastries since I saw so many gorgeous pictures on YELP. Got there and they literally only had a piece of Lava Cake, 2 cookies and a truffle ball. Got the Lava Cake- which was DISGUSTING. Like, how could you mess up a freaking Lava Cake... They said they make it with coconut flour. Guys please. No need to use some fancy vegan flour, if the cake is dry AS F and is tasteless- Only the color of the cake reminded me of chocolate.

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,11414,"I would recommend this place to anyone simply because of how adorable it is. My sister and I ordered the chocolate mud cake and earl grey cookie with our soy lattes. It was all brought to our table on cute dishes-it's as though you're having a tea party. The latte didn't have a strong coffee flavor and had a little too much foam on the top. The pastries were good, though, especially the earl grey cookie; it is loaded with tea leaves and has a powerful taste. Before dessert we shared two vegan crepes: the Garden of Eatin' and Room for Mushroom. They both have a strange combination of ingredients but somehow remain balanced and delicious. I did unfortunately find a couple of lemon seeds in one of the crepes. They are also a bit expensive but it's just the reality of economics! It's not like there is many other vegan crepe places. We also got the Blue Haze smoothie. It didn't taste much like newtella, which is odd since nut butters are usually a prominent taste in drinks. We didn't get to sip much more of it before my sister accidentally spilled it on our table. Oh no she didn't! Don't worry, because my sister told the workers about it and they made us a new one on the house. I was glad for the replacement not just because it gave us back what we lost but because the second one turned out better than the first. Which makes me question their ability to produce consistent quality. The place has a lot of seating upstairs and is a nice place to relax and enjoy vegan delights. And the workers bring your food to your table and in my case, remake smoothies that your sister tosses to the ground!

Then on another occasion I wanted just fresh squeezed orange juice (had someone pick it up for me) they came back somehow convinced ginger should be added. I was ok with that until I sipped the juice and realized they gave me ginger with a tsp of orange juice. I called it quits after that.

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,200072,"We decided to come here on mother's day. The reviews were praising, the day was beautiful and all was good.The first thing that stood out when coming in was the lack of waiting line for a Sunday brunch in a New York establishment... a wonderful sign for us parents with two little children.Our order consisted of 5 crepes and we were informed that the wait will be around 20 minutes. A long wait for something a basic as a crepe, especially when there is no line and the place has 50% empty seats. But as I said, the sun was out and we wanted to dine on the delicacies we heard of. While waiting at our table the couple behind us got up in a huff saying ""wow, this is absurd! Where is our food?"". They left and I was interested in what happened but didn't ask(being in the industry I know that people can blow things out of proportion).Unfortunately this what not the case and I could not put it down as ""another spoiled customer who thinks they need extra special care"".We waited 35 minutes with great patience and could not even get a glass of water due to lack of glasses next to the tap water dispenser. With the kids beginning to get restless and loud, I went down to ask if they forgot us. There stood a cook lazily working one side of a crepe cooker, using the other side to keep other orders warm. I asked him when we will get our food and he replied that it will take another 15 to 20 minutes because we are the third ticket down!! I wanted to know why and the answer was ""well, it's brunch in Williamsburg, this is how it is"". Really?????? Is that  your answer?As a chef and a patron of many crepe establishments I know what making a crepe entails but in all truth, this is not the issue. It was the blatant disregard to any customer wait time, being it logical, functional, proper customer service or just basic manners.Tell me someone called out and you are short handed, tell me you burned my order or it's not up to your standards and you are making me a new one, say you are very sorry and that it's a priority.....make something up!!!! But to just stare at me and imply that I needed to predict this waste of time is an insult to me and all the others that sat around us. If the implication that brunch is always hectic then the establishment needs to be ready on those days. And if still management is not willing to invest in proper equipment and staff then at least notify the guests of the real waiting time instead of just stringing them along. Snubbing us as if we were the ones who dared hope for 5 crepes in under an hour makes you look foolish and an amateur at best.When we left and wanted a refund to our purchase, the cook offered us one of our crepes that was already done (apparently it was destined to sit 20 more minutes waiting for the rest of our food) as consolation. Being that my wife is vegan and was very hungry we took it. We all wait for food but there is a limit. The quality of the food can be amazing but it does not justify horrible service. Definitely not on a ""busy brunch"" when half of the seats are empty and there is no line to come in.We sat at one of the other neighborhood restaurants, ordered and were served in under 10 minutes!!!!

Little Choc Apothecary,5602,141 Havemeyer St,Brooklyn,11211.0,1410,"Little Choc Apothecary has won my heart with delicately homemade crepes and cookies! My friends and I came here and ordered on the first floor and proceeded upstairs to comfortably seat ourselves and wait for our delicious meals to arrive. We arrived for an afternoon brunch and really enjoyed ourselves (well, at least I did). The wait time came out to 27 minutes.     FOOD:     Double Chocolate Chip Cookie (5/5) = The double chocolate chip cookie was chewy and melted in my mouth.      Earl Grey Cookie (4.5/5) = I expected the early grey cookie to be as chewy as the double chocolate chip cookie, but to my surprise, it wasn't. The aroma of earl grey was distinct in the cookie and great tasting, but it wasn't a chewy cookie and I've always had a strong preference for chewy cookies. Also, the earl grey cookie seemed a tad oily to me.     Room For Mushroom (5/5) = This was the savory crepe I had ordered! This healthy and hipster dish consisted of herb roasted mushrooms, spinach, walnuts, tahini basil sauce. From the first bite, to the last, I kept telling myself to savor every last bit! Little Choc creates chewy crepes (heads up!).      The Breakfast (Friend's order) = This savory crepe consisted of scrambled tofu, homemade coconut bacon, spinach, cucumber. My meat-loving friend ordered this and he was not satisfied, but then again, who needs his opinion (haha)?     Newtella Strawberry (Friend's order) = Another meat-lover friend ordered this and she was content with her meal and found it unique that Nutella had a vegan twist to it. :)     DESIGN:     The exterior was very open and hipster, which was what attracted my friends and I (I love the open juice bar). The interior was very ""Alice In Wonderland"" to me and I really enjoyed receiving a playing card table number (this was such a fun concept)!      The bathroom aka ""the loo"" was cute and clean.     There is complimentary water available and clean up is on the customers (place your used utensils and dishes in the pantry box).     PS: Check in on YELP to receive 10% off any item in the store!",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,10.5,"friends,chocolate chip cookie,cookies,crepes,Earl Grey Cookie,heart,playing card table number,meals,floor,afternoon brunch,friend,cookie,Little Choc Apothecary,Friend,hipster,cookie,Double Chocolate Chip Cookie,cookie,cookie,cookies,mouth,FOOD,crepe,crepe,earl grey,crepes,aroma,Room,dish,Newtella Strawberry,spinach,mushrooms,last,order,spinach,surprise,preference,tasting,walnuts,tahini basil sauce,bite,cucumber,coconut bacon,tofu,Friend,exterior,interior,juice bar,Mushroom,water,bathroom,The Breakfast,dishes,loo,customers,utensils,pantry box,item,store,friend,Alice In Wonderland,meal,twist,DESIGN,PS,YELP,opinion,Nutella","1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,4,1,7,3,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,3,7,2,3,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,1,5,7,7,7,6,7,7,7","0.114945434034,0.0941623672843,0.0923657789826,0.0716123357415,0.0573281906545,0.0531939081848,0.0365797206759,0.0290620941669,0.0254478938878,0.0253181811422,0.0217180792242,0.020595440641,0.0185246374458,0.0153207015246,0.0152185661718,0.0120907966048,0.0119367102161,0.0119186816737,0.0113497646526,0.0113497646526,0.00962980929762,0.00962980929762,0.00929871667176,0.00825885683298,0.008136106655,0.00795909017324,0.0077321450226,0.00770757766441,0.00765279727057,0.00745650846511,0.00736751267686,0.00736751267686,0.00673431670293,0.0067200823687,0.0067200823687,0.00648847455159,0.00647581694648,0.00647581694648,0.00644662464038,0.00644662464038,0.00643884623423,0.0058799921535,0.0058799921535,0.0058799921535,0.00526103377342,0.00523251481354,0.00522849662229,0.00455167004839,0.00436893245205,0.00370807945728,0.0036177278962,0.00361657771282,0.00346019421704,0.00302937650122,0.0030273005832,0.0030273005832,0.0030273005832,0.00302533223294,0.00302533223294,0.00290723610669,0.0025921377819,0.00219867751002,0.00192352745216,0.00192195363343,0.00179078325164,0.00179078325164,0.00163257191889,0.00121300225146"

But thankfully the guy making crepes helped her out. The matcha latte itself was a little underwhelming. The matcha was a bit bland and didn't have much of a fresh matcha taste to it and it was almost as if the soy milk took center stage.

Little Dumpling,5603,252-20 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,200357,"This review is a day late but I came in on a Sunday. It was pretty busy so it might explain why it took almost an hour to be seated. Actually, no it doesn't. Because, my party and I were waiting and people who came after us got seated before us. So we finally get seated by the host and he tells us to enjoy our meal. But we didn't even order yet.... Now, let's be honest. There are more cons than there are pros. So let's start with the pros. Pros: Good service. The waitress was friendly. The decor was nice and it seemed clean enough.Cons: We got an order of soup dumplings and as soon as we picked them up they all popped... Other than that the food was pretty alright. But everything was so expensive. The spicy beef noodle soup is 9.50. You could go to flushing and get better for half the price.

Definitely a go to place if you are near by. The three star rating is due to the following: FoodAmbianceServiceFood: my boyfriend and I tried the pork xiao long bao, spicy beef noodle soup, and eight treasure noodle.The pork xiao long bao was good, but nothing that stood out. They should work on the flavor and the vinegar wasn't as sour as most places. I did like the dough since it was light, thin, and not easily torn. The spicy noodle soup is suppose to enduce flavors of spice, salt, sour, and a hint of sweet. The dish at little dumpling  had the right amount of spice, but too sweet. It wasn't terrible, but it was a little weird drinking such a sweet soup. Otherwise everything else was great, tender beef and great noodles. The eight treasure noodle was the best of the three. They did a great job with flavoring, although I would prefer a little more sauce, but it was delicious. Ambiance: very asian, but with a touch of moderness. The restaurant was very clean and slightly dimmed. Great for family dinner or a date. I felt clean and comfortable.Service: great service, best yet compared to many other chinese owned restaurants.

The entrees took some time to come out but it was well worth the wait.The only reason I knocked it down a star was because to the service was a little off. Waiters were inattentive and nonchalant.

Dumplings here are still good and the other foods are still halfway decent. Don't get me wrong. But the service has gone way, way downhill.

Many tables around us were seated and got their dishes before my wife decided to say something to the server. He said ""oh it's coming."" Another ten minutes and nothing. We stop him again and he says the same thing. No explanation. Tables that were seated after us are now finished with their meals and getting ready to leave. After about the third time we asked, one of the dishes came out. After a few minutes another. OK cool. Where's the third? After about ten minutes my wife asks our server again, and he rudely says, ""it's coming. do you want it or not?"" what. Now I'm not being pissy because the food took a while. It's the fact that there was no explanation  whatsoever as to why our food was taking longer than everyone else's. If he at least was upfront that the kitchen may have missed our order I would have been fine. And this kid has the nerve to give attitude? hell outta here. we ask for a manager but of course there's no manager. our server disappears and another waitress is sent over to our table to try to figure out what's going on. We explain the situation to her and she says she'll go talk with the manager to figure something out. right. so this asshole manager not only refused to speak to us, but he sent this poor girl over to try to fix a problem he should have been dealing with personally. that's disgraceful.

Little Dumpling,5603,252-20 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,16392,"We've been hearing the word on the street about a new xiao long bao (XLB) place that also makes a good beef noodle soup so we had to check it out. It's not common to find decent Shanghainese/ Taiwanese food in these (little) neck of the woods. I am all for avoiding Flushing if possible because of the traffic congestion and crowds.We came on a Sunday evening at 7:30 and the popularity of this place was obvious. We had to wait about 15 mins for a table for 3. Looking at the menu we noticed that prices were about $2-$5 more compared with places we usually go to but after tasting the food, we felt the difference was insignificant.  We ordered crab XLB, beef noodle soup and Shanghai style rice cakes. Our waiter was extremely hospitable and friendly. Repeating the order and explaining some dishes on the menu. He even brought over a small bowl and plastic utensils for our baby without us even asking. These small gestures make such a difference in having a positive or negative dining experience. Kudos for their outstanding service at a small casual restaurant.The two noodle dishes came out first since it takes about 10-15 mins for the dumplings to steam. Everything was really delicious. The beef soup comes in a deep bowl that I can image will be so nice when the weather gets colder. You just want to put your face in an inhale the aroma and slurp up the beef soup. The noodles were plentiful. I wish they had a little bit of pickled veg topping to add but it was still delicious. I've also had better noodles but i think its just a preference thing as nothing was bad about it. I'm not generally a fan of rice cakes but they make a very tasty version. Its well seasoned and has a little bit of extra sauce that isn't too greasy.We enjoyed our dinner so much we actually went back a few days later with my parents and sister to celebrate my birthday.  We had the same waiter again and he actually gave us a complimentary dish of cucumbers and edamame with tofu. They were very tasty sides and will order next time we come. For my dinner we got the pork and crab XLBs, beef scallion pancake, sauteed shrimp, crispy noodles, westlake pork belly, sauteed peashoots with mushrooms. The food was tasty.

Great service for starters, food was average tho. I had pork soup dumplings. Great flavor but the problem was the way they served them which was on a sheet of paper in a bamboo steamer. The dumplings got stuck to the paper which caused them to rip and spill the soup out. They were supposed to use a bed of cabbage. The beef and scallion pancakes had great flavor just a bit oily. To be safe I ordered the General Tso chicken. They were very light on the sauce but it had great flavor and the chicken pieces were a bit too small so the batter around the chicken was really overpowering. The problem there is that you'll taste oil if the sauce is really light. I also had a bit of the Chicken with eggplant. Not that I'm saying it's bad but I really wasn't a fan of it.

We got here a little after 11:30 and there were still plenty of seats inside since the restaurant just opened. There's a ""parking lot"" right outside but it only has 3 spots so you're basically going to have to find parking on the streets, which actually doesn't seem too bad in this area. The decor here was great! Definitely more upscale than the Shanghainese restaurants that you find in Flushing. They play Cantonese music!!!!!!!!! Service was excellent. Our server was very nice and always made sure that our cups were filled to the brim with green tea. They also speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese so it makes it that much easier for customers to order.Soup dumplings- Skins were thin, meat was savory, and soup was delicious! I think I like the ones here more than the ones at Nan Xiang!Beef scallion pancakes- If you thought the ones at Nan Xiang were good, these were 10x better! They only give you one piece of beef in the scallion pancakes at Nan Xiang but here they give at least 3 pieces! Beef was yummy and pancake was crispy.Beef pan fried noodles- Ok this one was kind of a letdown. The noodle to toppings ratio was just wayy off. There were not enough noodles so we had so much of the beef, corn, carrots, and veggies left after finishing the noodles. Sauce was a little too watery for my liking.Beef noodle soup- So delicious! The noodles weren't too hard but weren't too mushy either, just the right texture. The soup was delectable...perfect amount of spiciness added. The beef was not chewy and absorbed all of the delicious flavors of the soup!The decor here is great, the service is excellent and the food is delicious. So how come it didn't get 5 stars from me? Two reasons: One is because the pan fried noodles just left me kind of disappointed since I've had better in Chinatown. Second is because when we were about to leave, we brought the money, including the tip, to the cashier in the front, not knowing that we were supposed to leave the tip on the table. The cashier gave us a very nasty attitude regarding this that I found very off-putting...He definitely could've handled the situation in a much more amicable manner...This is why no matter how good the food at a restaurant is, the business will never be perfect if they hire pricks to work there...Tragic because I really thought this was going to be a 5 star review...",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,15.6000003815,"restaurant,streets,friends,lunch,restaurants,parking,parking lot,amount,kind,seats,spots,English,Service,server,decor,ones,Beef,attitude,soup,plenty,fried noodles,beef,noodle,business,tip,area,pancake,cashier,green tea,brim,cups,beef,noodles,Beef noodle soup,situation,ones,scallion pancakes,scallion pancakes,meat,Nan Xiang,Sauce,Soup dumplings,customers,letdown,toppings ratio,Nan Xiang!Beef,noodles,much,veggies,corn,carrots,texture,money,Shanghainese,Flushing,piece,pieces,cashier,music,table,front,food,Mandarin,Cantonese,restaurant,star review,beef,ones,pan fried noodles,pricks,manner,service,tip,stars,Skins,soup,decor,food,Chinatown,spiciness,all,flavors,reasons","2,2,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,4,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,1,2,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7","0.0784170776606,0.0695381313562,0.0550173521042,0.0550173521042,0.049899186939,0.0469954609871,0.0304265208542,0.0300436280668,0.0284882858396,0.0262871719897,0.0261530261487,0.0204082261771,0.0148440748453,0.0148190241307,0.0135998399928,0.0126645117998,0.0125106638297,0.0114725166932,0.0114221516997,0.0114135025069,0.0111637152731,0.0104905208573,0.0104683572426,0.0102370949462,0.0102090444416,0.0100047886372,0.00995872355998,0.00992341060191,0.00988130364567,0.00988130364567,0.00988130364567,0.00957146007568,0.00957146007568,0.00869881547987,0.00846603326499,0.00836000218987,0.00836000218987,0.00834991596639,0.00795538630337,0.00747216911986,0.00723332585767,0.00666240183637,0.00666240183637,0.00663815997541,0.00663143070415,0.00622080266476,0.00607898551971,0.00606284383684,0.00606284383684,0.00606284383684,0.00606284383684,0.00605259276927,0.00595581391826,0.00588711956516,0.00588711956516,0.00539445038885,0.00539445038885,0.00515079358593,0.00481678172946,0.00450649671257,0.00450649671257,0.00436566956341,0.00394466938451,0.00394466938451,0.00391867477447,0.0038195012603,0.00373541912995,0.00362190022133,0.00328619149514,0.00311816902831,0.00311816902831,0.00304867210798,0.00302426470444,0.00291507132351,0.00288583524525,0.00284480466507,0.00277279224247,0.00277279224247,0.00266935233958,0.00198170379736,0.00198026746511,0.00198026746511,0.00197762297466"

And being very rude about it when we pointed out the mistake.Possibly the worst restaurant experience I have encountered.I don't know why this place has good reviews because the food is OVERPRICED and below satisfactory. And to top it off, good luck if they make a mistake on your bill or you doing like the food they serve because they clearly aren't focused on customer satisfaction.Also when you pay $50+ for three ""takeout"" style.

You can't miss their cute soup dumpling logo, and it's literally telling you to come eat. There's (very) limited parking in the front, but they do have a ""hidden"" garage area (free parking) if you circle around. I recommend coming here during lunch hours or early evening, right before the dinner rush. This place can get pretty packed, so keep that in mind.

Little Dumpling,5603,252-20 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,199666,"Little Dumpling gets at least four stars for food. I've been going there for years for the soup dumplings, tasty noodles, soups, and proteins, and the reasonable prices. The food is comparable to some of the fare you'd find in much more cramped quarters in Flushing. That all being said, I don't think I'll be frequenting this place as often as I have in the past. I think Little Dumpling is becoming a victim of its own success. The prices recently increased and the service has gotten markedly worse, especially if you aren't or don't appear Asian. Yesterday my husband and toddler and I went in for dinner. There was a line as always, so we took our number and waited.  Thirty minutes later the number before ours was called. Three minutes after that, the number after ours was called. We looked at each other but shrugged it off, figuring a table of our size just wasn't available.  We then proceeded to watch the owner approach three parties of three and seat them before us.  My husband asked him what was going on.  He mumbled something about us being next. He then grabbed a high chair and showed us to a two top that had been open for 10 minutes.   We could barely fit three plates on the table.  Our server took ten minutes to arrive, while three tables of Asian patrons were sat while we waited, served hot tea, and had their orders taken.  When our server arrived, she didn't offer us water or tea, but gruffly said, ""you know what you want?"", took our order, and disappeared for another 20 minutes.  Needless to say, we ate as fast as we could once the food finally arrived and then hastily made our exit.

The skin was a little thick, but the soup was delicious.Scallion Pancake: It was very nice and crispy, how scallion pancakes should be. Really good!Spicy Beef Noodle Soup: This doesn't taste like traditional Taiwanese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup to me. The broth was just very spicy with not much other flavor. Most of the pieces of beef were rough and hard to chew.Shredded Pork With Celery & Dry Bean Curd: This dish was really delicious! It had a slight kick of spiciness, but it was also very refreshing because of the celery. If I come here again, I will definitely order this dish!Overall, this place is good enough for me to come back again if I'm in the area (but I'm never in Little Neck...).

The restaurant has a nice, clean, inviting atmosphere that does not suffer from the neon glow of flashing led lights like many other Chinese restaurants that have opened in the last couple years in Queens. It's comfortable and classic looking. The staff is accommodating, and prices aren't bad. It's on the high side for this fare, but I love not having to schlep to Flushing for good Shanghainese food, so I'm OK with paying a bit extra. I also love anything they use their soup base to make. Noodle soups, their hot pots -  all really wholesome and delicious. Doesn't leave me parched from msg like a lot of other places. I've also had northern/Taiwanese breakfast here (their version of dimsum I guess). The pancakes and the soy milk are all yummy. And, yes you can get soup dumplings that early!

My absolute go to place is Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao. However, this place does have some good alternate dishes. Beef with peppers (spicy, not bell) is very good. The family always likes to get the beef with pan fried noodles. Plus they have bubble tea.

I think this place will be around for a while if they keep up the quality of their food.Try it!The parking lot is a hot mess, FYI.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",1,0,0.5,4.5,"fact,place,cash,quality,takeout,beef noodles,scallion pancakes,broth,scallion pancakes,dumplings,bubble tea,size,noodles,place,mess,parking lot,food.,beef,portion","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7","0.387396365404,0.198066860437,0.0782886296511,0.0455826148391,0.0322696119547,0.0319215282798,0.0248222500086,0.0241333469748,0.0232231318951,0.0217354409397,0.0217354409397,0.0216567795724,0.0212027449161,0.0205873511732,0.0126557247713,0.0124967740849,0.0102079315111,0.00741098169237,0.00460650958121"

Little Dumpling,5603,252-20 Northern Blvd,Little Neck,11362.0,120298,"Taiwanese dishes not really authentic, but soup dumplings make up for it.What we ordered:Sesame noodles (ma jiang mian) - the sauce was definitely not made from ground sesame and peanut...it was this dark, runny, peanut flavored soy sauce concoction. Not a bad flavor, but definitely not authenticBeef scallian pancakes - a standout dish, even though it wasn't like how they make it in taiwan. They fry it so the outside is crispySoup dumplings - not bad, but not great. Definitely better than average here in New York, though. The dumpling skin was thin, soup was plentiful, but flavor wasn't great...too salty.Taiwanese rice noodles (chow mee fun) - so disappointed about this. It tasted more like chinese takeout. Even though they added the traditional ingredients (sliced pork, carrot, etc), they also unecessarily added some thick sauce that made it taste more like boxed chow mien.Overall, prices were reasonable (cash only), and soup dumplings are pretty decent.
