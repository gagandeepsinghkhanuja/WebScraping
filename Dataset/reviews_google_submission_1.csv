There was a self-appointed DJ playing Peter Gabriel and KC and the Sunshine Band on youtube on a giant projected screen. Soccer posters are everywhere. Anyway, we intentionally ordered as much food as possible to get a wide sampling of what is available. Strangely, they don't have coffee, so we ended up ordering some tamarindo and passion fruit juice, which was good enough. The first food that we got was also probably the best. Honduran enchiladas. The chicken was moist and juicy. The cabbage gave it a nice touch, with some raw pepper and pickled onion giving it a tasty crunch. Next we got a bean soup with chicharron, with came with rice, avocado, and an entire plantain submerged in the depths. I didn't really know what to do with the chicharron, but it was tasty enough. Additionally, we got a breakfast platter with a fried porkchop, eggs, Honduran bread, mashed fried beans, feta-esque cheese, and avocado. I probably omitted some parts of it actually. Although the pork was a little dry, the food was in general pretty good. We would come here again and try out some new things.

La Petite Provence,5317,255 Smith St,Brooklyn,11231.0,91511,"""Holy sh!t is it hot in here or am I just that hungover? My very hungover friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon to grab lunch and it was hot as hell in there. I don't know why the heat was blasting but I thought I was menopausing prematurely. Little did we know that EVERYTHING was HOT in here. And not in a good way. They eventually turned down the heat but apparently turned up the heat on our soups. Boiling hot carrot soup. Like there were bubbles and I burned my insides. It was reminiscent of that McDonald's hot coffee lawsuit hot. If they had given us any ice cubes, I would have poured them in the soup. It was also bland and boiling hot. My friend skipped on eating his and I eventually ate mine after pouring salt and pepper in it.Then the other half of our meal came... his Quiche and my Croque Monsieur. Both were tasty but again super burning hot. I guess I shouldn't complain. Getting cold food sucks, but for real, maybe give it a minute since I hate when the roof of my mouth or tongue gets burned.So both of us were kinda disappointed, but what made this place just A-OK was their fantastic desserts and discovering that it's BYOB.

I look at it , look at her, i ask, what the hell is going on, is this a new drink. She said no its a egg. I said u want me to drink my egg? Then she said, how do u boil a egg. WTF. No this is not a cultural thing. I had mentioned before, my husband is from ecuador. I turn to the hubby and say do u have hard boiled eggs in ecuador, yes they do he replies.  Also my husband had said i want a dish that includes a avocado , she says yes we definately have that.

La Raza Deli,5325,3602 Nostrand Ave,Brooklyn,11229.0,33551,"Visited a friend, and had a craving for Mexican munchies.  We decided to order delivery from a deli near him that had recently opened.  I'm no expert on authentic Mexican food, but I thought that given the location and price, if I lived around here, I would probably order from here all the time.  One of my friends had the milanesa de pollo platter - he received a generous helping of chicken that was crisp and tender, with a side of rice and beans.  He indicated that he would have liked a little more seasoning in everything, but we're all sodium fiends so take that with a grain of salt (ha!)Another friend had a chorizo burrito, I'm not sure whether he enjoyed the burrito itself more - or the fact that it was only 6.99. The burrito was filled with rice, beans, paper thin tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, and sour cream.I am a tostada addict, and ordered two chorizo tostadas.  Going forward, anytime I am in the area, I will DEMAND that someone order these for me.  At 2.99 each, two were generous, and they do not skimp on the chorizo!  Despite the fact that we had ordered delivery, both were crisp and crunchy by arrival, despite the heaping toppings weighing them down. Each tostada was loaded with beans, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, and avocado.I have to bring up a few other points that mean a lot to me when ordering delivery:timing - the food arrived 20 minutes before the estimated delivery time, this means no one has to deal with a hangry Jen (and NO ONE wants to deal with a hangry Jen)packaging - everything was packed neatly in separate paper bags, and there was zero leakage or shifting, it may not mean much to everyone, but I certainly appreciate when food is packed with care.service - the guy who dropped off the food was friendly, and thanked us for giving the deli a tryJust the service and the quality of the delivery makes me want to support small businesses like this on a regular basis. So if you're in the area, drop by for a chorizo tostada, and let me know what i'm missing out on from the rest of the deli.",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,5.0,"expert,friend,One,price,craving,munchies,deli,delivery,Mexican,food,chicken,tostada,location,fact,sodium fiends,burrito,guy,friends,beans,everything,rice,helping,seasoning,delivery,side,pollo platter,chorizo tostadas,friend,chorizo burrito,burrito,beans,chorizo,lettuce,avocado,rice,beans,area,deli,fact,sour cream,lettuce,both,grain,salt,tostada addict,tomatoes,someone,food,toppings,arrival,cheese,everyone,leakage,service,delivery,deli,food,paper bags,chorizo tostada,points,service,area,delivery,quality,businesses,basis,rest,no one,food,tryJust,NO ONE,lot,packaging,everything,Jen","1,1,1,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,4,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,2,7,7,3,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1","0.264061063528,0.0625529661775,0.0571973025799,0.053670745343,0.0384482294321,0.0384482294321,0.0300748478621,0.0300748478621,0.0294270385057,0.0246924180537,0.0211486592889,0.0188590493053,0.0182911958545,0.0162946544588,0.0150074558333,0.0148191954941,0.0101805040613,0.00876162853092,0.00876162853092,0.00873692985624,0.00797048024833,0.00715374620631,0.00713356910273,0.00700101582333,0.00697491364554,0.00697491364554,0.0063365441747,0.00628704344854,0.00590133806691,0.00588772865012,0.00588772865012,0.00577797321603,0.00535560492426,0.00535560492426,0.00535560492426,0.00535349640995,0.0053451587446,0.00522515457124,0.00487607810646,0.00486957468092,0.00486957468092,0.00470992410555,0.0046969614923,0.0046969614923,0.00468612555414,0.00468612555414,0.00467698322609,0.00430545490235,0.00426645390689,0.00426645390689,0.00426076212898,0.0040003019385,0.00380153721198,0.00363854691386,0.00361849390902,0.00361412577331,0.00329946703278,0.00318347313441,0.00297769811004,0.00259265513159,0.00251932139508,0.00251627922989,0.0022926570382,0.00220412318595,0.00220412318595,0.00220412318595,0.0022014612332,0.00190606946126,0.00188878120389,0.00188461667858,0.00159600609913,0.00139627035242,0.00139627035242,0.00134451384656,0.00106542860158"

I am Ecuadorian.. Upon arrival, everything looked very clean and the Dominican hostess attended us with patience and kindness. It was four of us. Our orders were chaulifan, ceviche de pescado, ceviche de cammaron and guatita. The chaulifan was delicious and eventually the whole table ended up digging in because we were disappointed with the rest of our orders. The ceviches were mediocre. No flavor. I felt like I was consuming water with oil and could barely eat more than a third of the plate. The waitress noticed and asked me if I didn't like it. I told her it wasn't flavorful and not actually 'Ecuadorian' and she basically said she didn't know about Ecuadorian cuisine... When I asked for the check I could not believe the waitress had taken her pen and written in a 18% tip in for herself... I did not like that. When we get back the check, I see no reason for the waitress/server to fill in that portion.. Overall nothing special to ever come back to.

We got a fish casserole that was really good (though don't take it home -- tastes worse the next day), fried pork with corn chunks (juicy and I always love huge corn), and a mixed platter that had a number of toppings including tripe, two kinds of seafood, all over rice. I'd highly recommend the mixed platter if you want to see what these guys are all about, and the seafood casserole if you have more room. Can't speak for anything else at this time, but would be excited to come back and try again.P.S.

I'll just chalk it up to a bad night.Quick summary: I was by myself, decided to have the paella carne and that was a 25-minute wait, so in the meantime I ordered, at the waitress's suggestions, the shrimp in garlic tapas. She said it was everyone's favorite. Really? Oily, overcooked shrimp in a nondescript garlic sauce? How can garlic sauce be nondescript? The shrimp (small, I'd put them at 20/22's) were tasteless and the garlic sauce was tasteless. The bread was hard. Not a good start but I enjoyed the cold beer and waited for the paella.It arrived, on time, and it was hot. The paella pan had obviously been put in the oven which, while I like hot food, made it ridiculously hot. And, the carne; chicken, beef and sausage, were about 20 minutes overcooked; dry, tasteless and tough.I finished, waved off taking the remainder home (it'll easily feed two or perhaps I just wasn't that interested in eating tasteless tough meat) and asked for the check.I waited at least 15 minutes while the waitress chatted with (I assume) the owner or the manager.

Sweet and savory.Pincho Sierra y Mar - served on a skewer like a mini kabob.  This was ok, not that big of a fan of the chorizo.  They were like little vienna sausagesCroquetas de Bacalao, Serrano o Espinaca  - we got the codfish croquettes.  Good, but can easily be passed. I've had better.Mejillones al Vapor - Mussels.  Great flavor, broth was also great for bread dipping.  I just couldn't get enough of that bread!Pulpo a la Gallega - Octopus Galician style.. imported from Spain.  This is served cold and was alright.  Not a lot of flavor.  Seems like they just toss it in EVOO and sprinkle lots of paprika on top.  Octopus was very tender though.Prices are good and the tapas are delicious.  Great little spot for a date or a night out with friends.",5.0 star rating,"Astoria, Queens, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,13.3000001907,"place,tapas,anchovies,stop,map,app,N/Q.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,108227,"I do not give out 5 stars that easily.This restaurant surpassed my expectations. Spanish food--particularly from the Andalusian and Galician regions of Spain hold a special place in my heart, and of course, my palate. I've been to Galician style cangrejadas, and have become well acquainted with Spanish paella thanks to our wonderful family friend Maria Belén--who lived almost all her life in Galicia. I will always be grateful to her for introducing me to the decadent pleasures of traditional Southern Spanish and Galician/Portuguese cuisine.We ordered a number of plates, and I sampled a little from each. I've had their Salmon and Spanish style capers and signature saffron yellow rice, Spanish blood sausage, their weekend special of slow roasted Pork, tongue appetizers, caramelized dates wrapped in bacon, and some salad mostly made up of mixed greens.If you're feeling adventurous--try the tongue. A cold, salty appetizer that has a hard, rubbery texture--as if you were biting into hard cheese in the beginning, but I promise you'll be surprised, and go in for a second, or maybe a third. My favorite appetizer though, are their dates wrapped in bacon. I don't have the vocabulary to describe the concoction of flavors that conspire to titillate your taste buds to gustatory orgasm! They are an absolute MUST.Of all I sampled, I have to say the quality of the food is amazing. Not to say I am a professional food taster--but the food is good enough, I believe one can tell it isn't bought from Key Food. The Salmon doesn't have a fishy smell, and the meat is so soft and very well seasoned it melts the moment you put it in your mouth. Their blood sausages are unlike any I have ever had--I love the sweet aftertaste and the soft texture, hinting its freshness.As for their drinks? I recommend their white Sangria. It has the gentle sweetness of Moscato wine, a known refreshing summer drink. With their golden yellow walls and rustic Spanish decor, you could almost escape the winter blues.The staff is attentive, friendly adding to the enjoyment of your experience.What can I say? You don't even eat THIS good in Manhattan. Eat better and for the quality of food you get--pay less.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,16704,"I was excited to try this place out since I love Las Ramblas and Alta, and was looking forward to finding a great tapas place closer to home.   The sangria is decent, strong enough and a bit on the sweet side.  We ordered half a pitcher of the champagne sangria for two people, it came out to about one and a half glasses per person.  No complaints there.  I found that the food left something to be desired.  It was hard to get the attention of our waiter but once we ordered the food, the dishes came out incredibly fast.  We split: Dátiles con Bacón (Dates w/Bacon) -- Bacon was not crispy, the flavors of the sweet date and the salty bacon were there, but it only made me think of how amazing Alta's bacon wrapped dates areCroquetas de Bacalao (Cod Croquette) -- Creamy, not fishy, I enjoyed these croquettes. Alcachofas con Jamon (Artichoke hearts w/Serrano Ham) -- We were looking forward to these but they were pretty unremarkable.  Tasted like canned artichoke hearts with bits of bacony tasting ham on it.  Sounds better than it really was, we didn't even want to finish all of them.  Croquetas de Serrano (Serrano Ham Croquettes) -- We ordered these after liking the cod croquettes and hearing that they were known for these dishes.  It was okay, bits of serrano ham in the croquettes added texture, but by this point I was pretty unimpressed with the fact that they threw this ham in a lot of their dishes.   I liked the cod ones better.  Piquillos Rellenos de Morcilla (Sweet Red Pepper Stuffed w/ Blood Sausage) -- This was our favorite dish and the most unique of all the tapas we tried.  The red peppers were stuffed with what seemed like ground blood sausage, and covered in a very tasty orange sauce that I kept eating with bread after.  This dish won nods of approval and ""mms"" for both of us.  I would come back to have more of this.  Pulpo a la Gallega (Boiled Octopus w/Smoked Paprika, Potatoes & Olive Oil) -- This sounded great, but I suspect any of the nearby Greek places would have done a better job.  The octopus tasted like it was just boiled, and then heavily salted and slathered in unnecessary amounts of olive oil.  Another dish I would pass on next time.  Cream and Walnut Ice Cream -- We finished with dessert, which came in a terra cotta cup similar to the ones that Cafe Mundo give you.  The ""cream"" part of it was a light-tasting ice cream that was rather icy, and since the dessert comes imported in the cup already, it was clear that the walnuts had been sitting in the ice cream for a while and had gotten soggy.  Overall, this is a very average tapas place.  The food is unremarkable with the exception of the red pepper stuffed with blood sausage, and while I am not dying to go back to try other things on the menu, I do think you it's a good option to have a group dinner since it's a laid back restaurant with plenty of space, and the food and sangria are good enough to enjoy a night out.  Personally, for my tapas fix, I'm heading to the West Village.",3.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",4,0,0.0,13.8999996185,"place,tapas place,home,Alta,ice cream,sangria,Dátiles con Bacón,Las Ramblas,champagne sangria,tapas

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,13532,"This is my 100th review for 2013. This is also Suanne L's 100th review for 2013. See what we did there? Does this level of Yelp coordination deserve recognition? How does Suanne juggle so many huge impending life events at the same time? Why do all of my reviews resemble a diary than an actual review?We attempted to address some of these questions in a sunny, breezy afternoon in La Rioja. While there were no outside seating, the completely opened garage doors allowed our table, closest to the entrance, to enjoy unobstructed fresh air. We half assedly perused* the super protein packed menu while catching up on the lives of our mutual friends** Boy... meat everywhere. I guess they don't have a butchery in the back of the restaurant for nothing.We decided to go all out on tapas. Unfortunately, they only had 1 special on tapas, which we passed on. Suanne ordered in her fluent Spanish. I felt bedazzlement from the waiter.Copy n paste job! Salmon ahumado (smoked salmon) - thin, long slices of smoked salmon. Eaten with bread. Simplistic and fresh, but nothing special.Pulpo a la gallega (boild octopus with potatoes and paprika) - My favorite of the evening despite not being big on octopus. It was tender and flavorful. Recommended.Patatas bravas (crispy potatoes with spicy sauce) - Not as daring as the Las Ramblas version, which punches you in the face with its spicy sauce. The La Rioja version is mild and plain, which just made it feel like empty carbs on that calorie tally.Esparragos a la vinagreta (white asparagus salad) - Another simplistic dish. Its more like strips of asparagus as opposed to an actual salad. Its served cold and provided a refreshing feel, especially for warmer weather.Solomillo de cerdo al ajo (fried pork cutlets) - I agree with Suanne that this was a miss. You don't get the crunch from the ""fried"" and ""cutlet"" and you don't get the tender and flavor from the ""pork."" What you're left with is just a dry, jerky piece of meat.I'll say I am relatively new at Spanish tapas. I cannot comment on the authenticity of any dish. But when I think of a lot of small plates served in fun and creative ways that goes beyond simplicity, I find myself more attracted to the mezze at Mezze Place.Ambiance and service were both good. You could see huge racks of meat being cut and served right in front of the customers. Little Spanish grocery items, snacks, and sangria decorated the furnishings in the back. All this made La Rioja a restaurant that you really want to love.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,61977,"Longing for the squid ink paella I had in Barcelona, I searched on Yelp for a place in NYC. After reading the reviews, we decided to venture to Astoria. It's pretty convenient, just 20 minutes from Times Square on the N. The place is casual but nice. We ordered the following tapas: Jamon Serrano (very good, generous portion for $9.95!), grilled squid and grilled shrimp (both were fine but nothing special), clams in a garlicky tomato sauce --- so delicious. The clams were fresh and perfectly cooked and the sauce is great for drenching the bread. We had a glass of white and red sangria, both were good and strong but we prefer a little more sweetness. The paella negra arrived piping hot. The rice was cooked perfectly with a bit of crispy bottom that I scraped from the pan. The seafood was cooked just right.  The flavor was fantastic, not overly salty so that you can truly taste the Unami goodness. Such a great entree for under $25 and definitely enough for 2. We ordered 2 desserts: crema Catalana and churros chocolate; both were ok but nothing special. Overall a great meal -nice friendly service and delicious food.  The bathroom was spacious and clean, can't say that for most restaurants in NYC.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,27571,"Anyone who's read my reviews knows I'm a sit-and-linger kind of diner. It's one of the reasons why I love Spanish cuisine so much - it's designed to be enjoyed with some wine and conversation. La Rioja is a little neighborhood gem that I simply adore. Their croquetas de bacalao (cod fish fritters) are so silky on the inside and so crispy on the outside. These fritters have a delicate flavor to them, and the size is perfect - each fritter is about the size of an olive. I could eat a whole pile of them. One of my favorite Spanish dishes is gambas al ajillo - shrimp in olive oil and garlic. This dish comes sizzling, and oh, my. The shrimp are good sized, and so tender, and that oil and garlic is perfect for dipping the crusty pieces of bread they bring to your table. The servers here understand, and they never seem to take the empty cazuela away, until we've wiped it clean. Now, I'm a fan of the Serrano ham, but it wasn't until La Rioja that I had a chance to taste the famed jamon Iberico. This ham comes from the black-footed pig, and at La Rioja, they hang them with the foot still attached, as is the custom in Spain, so you know what you're eating. If you're feeling indulgent, try the jamon Iberico de bellota. These pigs were fed a diet of acorns, and the nutty flavor really comes through.La Rioja has an extensive wine list, and their servers are always helpful with suggestions, based on your likes, dislikes and what you're having to eat.

The broth had all the natural sweetness and flavors from potatoes and lentils through slow cooking. They did not overpower the broth with salt or any other seasonings. They knew what each ingredients could do and had them to compliment each other to make a harmony. The next dish, rice with chicken and sausage was such a simple but excellent dish! The rice was not dried out - it was probably the best part of the dish as it has all these flavors from chicken, sausage, onions and chopped peppers and green olives. I think that green olives might be a star in here to make such a difference in this dish. And sausage and chicken still had wonderful flavors as they are supposed to be.

Stopping to look at the outside menu, the host quickly greeted us and offered a no-pressure invite into La Rioja. There was about half the restaurant filled and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves in a warm and friendly atmosphere. We ordered the red sangria and it was good. There is not over powering alcohol, but also it wasn't sweet. The only complaint with it as the fruit wasn't very ripe (but it was October). Complementary bread is served to you. The tables for two are a very good size to have multiple tapas and plates on your table at once and still have room to operate. We decided to order 3 tapas and split an order of paella. The tapas were very good. We had the Chorizos Al Vino Tinto (Sausages in Red Wine ). I would highly recommend this tapas. It was very good and the serving was much closer to an entree than a tapas portion. The tapas all came out at different times which worked very good. The cheese plate was good. The third tapas we had was the Solomillo De Cerdo (Pork Loin in Garlic Sauce) This was disappointing after having the Chorizos. The lamb seemed dry and the portion was the typical tapas serving size. I would rate the lamb tapas as 'average'. A group near us ordered ""The Famous Iberico Pig"" tapas and they bring the pig out to your table and thinly slice the meat right at your table side. Next time I will have to order this. The paella came out next and it was delicious! We chose the ""Paella De Mar"" The rice was tender and soft and it included a generous spread of seafood including mini squids, octopus, calamari, shrimp, salmon, calms, and mussels.

I just wish the bread came in a little basket with a napkin so it could stay warm longer. When you serve it out on an open late, it loses its heat pretty quickly, but I enjoyed the bread very much.I ordered the seafood paella. I thought it tasted pretty good. The rice was cooked all the way through and there was tasty little crispy bits on the edges. A good amount of seafood. You can order tapas here and other guests in the restaurant did. I looked at the various plates as they passed me on their way to the intended customers. They looked and smelled amazing.The restaurant is brand spanking new; having opened up quite recently. Everything still has that shiny new quality. interesting decorations on the brick side of the wall. Right now, it's a little too sterile to be that wonderful small cozy little restaurant that you and your honey go to have a quiet romantic interlude, but it has promise.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,17721,"Came here last night after walking by probably over 100 times over the years always thinking ""we should try this spot"". Well after a few rounds of pool at break my boyfriend and I came here for dinner. Overall it was a decent meal, the food was hit or miss, same as the service and drinks.Food:Serrano ham: huge portion, all for the BF, he was very happy Tetilla cheese: this was my favorite thing we ate. Tasty soft cheese with cubes of membrillo on topHouse salad: big portion with nice slices of manchego. Overall, a fine salad Spinach croquettes: these were really tasty as well. Crispy Panko crust and creamy cheese and spinach on the inside Shrimp in garlic sauce: this was ok. The shrimps were small and just seemed boiled, however the sauce was goodPaprika octopus: this was a huge miss. When I saw it I was really excited- huge portion and looked very flavorful. However, it tasted pretty bad. The octopus itself was ok, I wish it were grilled and not just boiled, but it tasted fresh. Something in the sauce was extremely bitter, either the oil was rancid or it was all the raw paprika. Either way, boyfriend and I kept trying to force ourselves to eat it (since we usually LOVE octopus).. we didn't make it very far here.Service:Service was odd. Our main server was nice overall. Our food came out really quick. I usually like when tapas comes out a few at a time.. and kind of flow it, oh well. Anyway the food runner was just piling food on our tiny table and laughing about how there was no room. I asked if he could pull over another table (place was empty). He didn't hear me (I guess?) and just keep squeezing things on the table and laughing. Oh well.. We needed more bread at one point for all the cheese/ham and it seemed like every employee vanished. Finally someone appears and we get bread, yay. When our waiter cleared the table he noticed we didn't finish the octopus so he asked if something was wrong with it. I really appreciated this and I told him the truth, there was some bad bitter taste in it. He said he'd go back and check, however nothing happened. He came back 10 or so mins later asking if we wanted dessert. Not sure if it was a peace offering for the octopus or not, we declined. Overall we had a decent meal,  but I doubt we'll be back. Too many better options in the area (kind of sad, it's the reality of Astoria now. So much competition everywhere).

One evening tired of the ""While we spend the evening in Astoria, why not having some Greek food?"".On our way, we see a tapas place we never have seen before., No ZAGAT rating, not in the Michelin Guide, except an A grade, nothing that makes you feeling adventurous about. However We looked at the menu outside and it was indeed sounding like the dishes we used to enjoy in Spain. Well let's give them a shot I proposed to my wife.And really I was not only positively surprised but much more AMAZED!The tapas were simply authentic, nothing too much nothing missing just the way you would expect them. The Jamon Iberico, even in Spain not always at this level.The entrees, were also simple but just the way it is suppose to be. We would love sharing ""specials"", but honestly we have been enjoying the place for almost 3 years now, we ate the whole menu up and down, and we were never disappointed. Personally I really discovered Sangria, I was never a big fan of it before.The Staff is making you feeling home instantly and in Summer, with the windows opened it feels like a Bodega in Barcelona!

We were soaking up with sauce with bread. It was incredible. The croquetas were creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Dates with bacon are always delicious and the perfect balance of salty and sweet.  I thought the sangria was too sweet and needed some more fruit. The pan tomaquet was soggy and needed more salt. But the tortilla Espanola makes me gag just thinking about it. It tasted like mold and has this bizarre fishy green sauce. There was also some type of like yucca or maybe re-hydrated squid on it too. It was fishy, tough, and nauseating. I will say the service was great. The manager took the tortilla Espanola off of our check. They also were attentive. The décor is a little sparse.

For entrees you must try the paella (very traditional and delicious), and the suckling baby pig (juicy fall of the bone) and of course the sangria!  They also have a great selection of ice cream desserts brought in directly from Spain that everybody should try.2) The service is awesome.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,151579,"Went here on 9/27/2011, my hubbie and I were very happy with the experience. We went during restaurant week, I wanted paella, so I got the prefix menu. H wanted other items on the menu, so he got a couple tapas, and an entree. What I got- spicy chorizo in wine- it was ok, H got blood sausage and tuna stuffed peppers- the blood sausage stuffed ones were delicious- better than the tuna; he also got the anchovies with avocado- they were tasty if your thing is anchovies.Seafood Paella- it was good. What would have kicked it up a few notches is if the rice was more crusty with chewy edges- as paella should be coming from a sizzling pan. The actual flavor was pretty good, but not amazing as I'd hoped. The staff were super attentive and friendly. The champagne sangria was FABULOUS- I have tasted and made my own Sangria many times so I can be picky- it was much better than the red sangria which I also tasted.

Otherwise, I was either not impressed by the food and grossed out by some of it.The lentil soup was bland, the Galician style Octopus was slimy and underseasoned, the shrimp in garlic sauce was decent but not outstanding, the chorizo was undercooked and tasted more like a klobasa, and the ham croquettes were gooey in the middle. The beef tongue was good but I did not expect it to be served cold - the dish resembled headcheese in a vinegar dressing.I might come back for sangria and order the bacon wrapped dates and a cheese plate (as it's difficult to mess up cheese), but I won't be back for dinner.

Qian and I met up for a Yelp date to sample their wares before I leave Astoria for good! Its like Suanne's farewell tour of Astoria eateries!This week, the doors were wide open, allowing the warm summer air to waft over the tables in the front. Its better than sidewalk dining! The chalkboard out front pointed out some of the goods for the evening. The restaurant and staff were welcoming and relaxed - its was a great start to the evening.We ordered:Salmon ahumado (smoked salmon)Pulpo a la gallega (boild octopus with potatoes and paprika)Patatas bravas (crispy potatoes with spicy sauce)Esparragos a la vinagreta (white asparagus salad)Solomillo de cerdo al ajo (fried pork cutlets)My favorites were the octopus and the asparagus. The octopus was exactly what I wanted - tender octopus in olive oil sliced very delicately. The asparagus was refreshing and tender. The potatoes were standard, the smoked salmon as salty and fresh as expected. The pork cutlets were terrible. You couldn't cut through them with the knives they provided you and were terribly dry. The menu is very protien heavy by the way - its not very vegetarian friendly. The service was friendly without being pushy and they were nice enough to let us sit and chat for a very long time. The decor is bright with splashes of Spanish tchokes - but is otherwise not memorable. It leans more casual.Value was okay - perhaps I should try one of their main entrees or paella next time.

A little on the pricey side (in my almost-empty wallet's opinion) because their products are imported from Spain. All the tapas I've had are awesome (chorizo, grilled squid, croquettes, can't remember what else at the moment). We usually take our free bread and wipe the plates clean. Also had delicious paella and steak several different times. Sangria is good and decently priced for a pitcher. The staff is really friendly. They check up all the time, but they may not directly ask if you need anything. You can easily just wave them down or ask when they stop by if you need something. Ambiance is usually with dimly lit lights which I like.

I have brought nearly everyone I know to this lovely place in the heart of activity in Astoria. The food is invariably excellent every time. It helps if you know the people but even unknown, you will have a delightfully wonderful epicurian feast. Depending on the quantity of people sitting at the table, any of their tapas dishes are excellent. The artichoke, sautee'd octupus, anchovies, and if you time then ask for the pernil (roast piggy) either for tapas or a main course. La Rioja offers a variety of traditional Spanish tapas and Paella. Their signature piggy dish is usually outstanding. My personal favorite is the lamb chops. Of course Spanish cuisine is fairly meat and fish intensive and La Rioja offers several types of Paella to facilitate your needs. So go there with an open mind and appetite, and try a little bit of everything.La Rioja has sumptuous wine from Spain and a fairly good variety and a selection of vintages. Desserts are all great. They have a dish with fruit and goat cheese....out of this world. Jose is the owner and works day and night and if there is something special that you care for in the realm of Spanish cuisine, call and ask him and he will be delighted to make it for you.

The owner/staff we're very friendly and service was fast. They bring you Warm bread when you sit down and you should definitely try the Sangria. The Suckling Pig served only on Friday's, Saturdays and Sundays is Absolute heaven. We went for the ribs (they have 3 types of cuts) which are so tender with crispy skin on top. Cooked exactly the same way they do in Spain on wood planks for 4-5 hours which helps cook all the fat off. If you have never had this classic Spanish dish it's a must try. You will be back for more and it's big enough for 3-4. For Tapas we tried the Apple Cider Chorizo which was a special, Croquetas De Bacalao, Gambas Al Ajillo and they we're all really good. The Dates with Bacon was a bit overcooked. We've been to Boqueria several times and I can tell you the food here is better. We like our food a bit spicy and they we're more than happy to accommodate and it came out perfect. The vibe is different being in Queens but if you want great Tapas at reasonable prices then this is the spot. We also had the Paella a few weeks ago on our first visit and you will not get some overcooked seafood mess with a ton of rice.This is about as good as you would get in Spain.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,2579,"This place left me feeling quite disappointed. While looking for a place to eat after Spain won the World Cup (I still can't believe it!), I had remembered seeing this place in Astoria once before and decided it was a wise choice. Walking in at around 9 pm, the place was crowded and we had to wait a bit to get a table. Not too bad, I suppose. We finally got a table after about 20-25 minutes. We received warm bread and butter quickly and ordered a pitcher of sangria. Unfortunately, the sangria was very sugary and didn't provide me with even the slightest buzz, which leads me to believe that there wasn't all that much alcohol in it. Sangria I've had elsewhere has definitely been more potent. On to the tapas! My boyfriend ordered a lentil soup (not the caldo gallego that comes with pork, but the lentil soup!) that we soon discovered had meat in it (this was not mentioned on the menu). I ordered the jamon serrano, which was good, but you can't mess that up much. Next up was my pollo al ajillo and his tortilla with salsa verde. Once again, his dish came with meat - seafood - which wasn't mentioned on the menu. Especially being that fish can be a huge food allergy for anyone, wouldn't they mention there was seafood with a tortilla? He politely took it off and struggled to eat the tortilla, despite the fact that he hates seafood. My dish was OK, but was lacking flavor. There was no choice between boneless or with-the-bone chicken, so I got a motley assortment of a leg, two wings, and some chicken breast, in a greasy garlic sauce. I ate what I could and settled on ordering dessert.For dessert, we got the churros con chocolate. The churros were too greasy, but the dipping chocolate was delicious and spot on. Unfortunately, it was too little, too late. I didn't come here for melted chocolate - I came here for a good meal. That just didn't happen.The wait staff was friendly, but the food just didn't cut it.

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,3194,"Overall, this place was pretty underwhelming. In fact, to write this review I just asked my friend what we ate there and he could not remember, despite the fact that we just visited the restaurant a few days ago.

This was very savory however SUPER SPICY, so if you can't handle spicy, I don't recommend it. The server felt bad that I couldn't finish it and asked me if I preferred something else. I said no, but he insisted that I should have something else so he brought out the shrimp 'al ajillo' (garlic shrimp) on the house!

La Rioja,5327,33-05 Broadway,Astoria,11106.0,47674,"One star for the great sangria and another star for the tapas. Tapas were good and sangria was good but nothing can shake off an obnoxious waiter and an extremely, unreasonably long wait plus mediocre entrees. I got 4 tapas - the croquettes, the bell peppers, the pork loins, and the spicy chorizo. If my review stopped here, it would be 3.5 stars. Unfortunately for me, it does not. My table got 3 orders of tapas in a decent amount of time but after a while, it seemed the waiter forgot about our 4th tapas order. Upon inquiry, he said it was our duty to remind him if anything was left out and gave me what seemed like a lecture. First of all, SIR, isn't that what I was doing? And second, although it's no big deal for a little reminder on a busy night, he made it seem as if it was actually our fault. I understand that the restaurant is hectic, but DO NOT make it seem as if it's the patron's responsibility to remind you of your job. All he had to say was ""oh, OK, I'll check on that."" If it weren't my mother's birthday, I would've counter- lectured his righteousness right out the door. Then came our entrees (we ordered steak, the seafood paella, and the red snapper), which required another reminder after a half an hour wait. By that time, my table was starving and so I had to flag down this poor excuse for a waiter and this time, more firmly, ask him when our food was arriving because it's been a while. He said the steak (which we ordered medium) takes a while. OK, sure. We sat and talked. Our food arrives around 10 mins after and we're all ready to dig in. First thing we notice - the steak is cooked RARE. The waiter said our long wait was because we ordered the steak and that takes a bit longer. I would've believed him if the steak came out juicy and succulent. Instead, it came out bloody. I'm not a cook but how long does it take for to cook a steak RARE?!!?!?! I'm can't give precise timing but I think a little less than 45 mins. The paella came out lukewarm so I'm sure we weren't waiting on the paella and unless the cook went to the Atlantic ocean to catch the red snapper, fish cooks relatively quickly.

Regina Pizzeria,5328,60-08 Kissena Blvd,Queens,11355.0,8495,I've ordered pizza from here a few times now because my preferred Pizza restaurant got a new chef and the transition was less than seamless but that's a story for another day. The pepperoni is really salty but I don't mind. They are pretty generous with it. The crust itself is on the thin side but not thin enough to be called thin crust. Not very heavy on the sauce even though I specifically requested that they add extra sauce. It doesn't seem like they did. If they did then I'd had to see what the slice would be like if I hadn't. The pizza is also on the oily side likely from the cheese that they are using. Overall decent and flavorful but not very filling. I can easily eat a whole pie from this place by myself. Another positive note is that their pies are also 3$ less than my usual place. Their delivery service is also speedier. My usual place takes about 45 mins whereas this one took about 30 mins at peak time hours. I wouldn't mind ordering from here again. Do they make the top of my pizza list though?

Add on your favorite toppings and I am certain you will agree.If you are looking for a full meal I would definitely give the Chicken Larondine a try. It is very rich, but very tasty.

They take forever to deliver and again, the infamous delivery guy is always cranky, sweaty, and too tired to deal. He practically throws the food at you. The food is still good, I was a huge fan of their entrees but now order maybe about 2 times a year. I'm almost scared to call for delivery anymore that's how bad it's gotten.

My family has been buying food from here for over 20 years (from when they were located in the city to when they moved to union turnpike). My favorite dish is their chicken francaise and we also usually buy their wings too. Each order usually comes with half or a whole loaf of sliced bread. We usually order pick-up and it always takes around 20-30 minutes. The wings are always good! My only complaint is that the food isn't always prepared the same. Every couple of months or so, I'll get a Chicken Francaise that tastes a little different and then after a while the next one I buy will taste like the one I know and love. It could be from different cooks preparing it differently. When I interned at the D.A.'s office, I came here everyday for pizza and occasionally a chicken francaise if I could afford it.

I thought.  And then she brought out the scissors.  she cut off a sizable chunk of skin and dropped it on our plate.  Relief!Eating that portion?  Happiness!  Those of you who love pernil or lechon know the deal: the meat is good, but it is the skin is where it's at.  When it is tough or chewy, it sucks.  La Rubia's was perfection.  Crisp, easy to bite through, and flavorful.  I gave my 7yo a bite and he nodded vigorously in approval.The rest of the food will meet expectations for a Dominican meal.  It looks like La Rubia does a lot of take-out business, and its prices are reasonable.  For two entrees, two bottles of soda, a Snapple, and a bottled water, the total came out to $20.When I am in the area again, I wouldn't mind a return visit.",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,12.3000001907,"amalgamation,Plan C.La Rubia,time,La Rubia,boys haircuts,caveats.,neighborhood,stars,place,restaurant,restaurants,chicken,delis,residences,warehouses,elements,auto body shops,address,La Rubia,skin,meat,door,rest,Smiles N Styles,restaurant,food,caveats,sense,food,For Sale by Owner,first,food,food,place,person,platters,problem,plate,area,ladyfolk,problem,amount,rice,rice,lady,glass,display,logjam,menu,workers,food,clientele,chunk,beans,children,adults,Jamaican,perfection,expectations,bite,business,area,total,meal,lot,return visit,water,soda,bottles,entrees,prices,scissors,skin,plate,skin,pernil,pernil,Relief,Happiness,deal,lechon,portion,Dominican,Snapple","7,7,4,1,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,4,7,6,6,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6","0.165330022573,0.107607349753,0.0913771241903,0.0720998868346,0.039999127388,0.0355297140777,0.0311277154833,0.0311277154833,0.0255988352001,0.0206896439195,0.0200732927769,0.0185312815011,0.0148627292365,0.0148627292365,0.0148627292365,0.0148627292365,0.0148627292365,0.0143305435777,0.0127980532125,0.0116211734712,0.0097332065925,0.00961693748832,0.00959095358849,0.00881279166788,0.00811504013836,0.00664248084649,0.00652755517513,0.00561806885526,0.00541504472494,0.00505948998034,0.00493562314659,0.00493562314659,0.0049301860854,0.00476641813293,0.00439007906243,0.00431854464114,0.00431702658534,0.00430941348895,0.00430330168456,0.00430330168456,0.00430330168456,0.0042046783492,0.00392803689465,0.00392803689465,0.00391973042861,0.00379333016463,0.00377718964592,0.00377080310136,0.00376517884433,0.00376517884433,0.00365160033107,0.00357906683348,0.00345294130966,0.00343678612262,0.00343299820088,0.00343299820088,0.00333639956079,0.00271172216162,0.0025423578918,0.0025423578918,0.00204833550379,0.00200981670059,0.00194606301375,0.00176010723226,0.00175919628236,0.00175832153764,0.00175832153764,0.00175832153764,0.00175832153764,0.00175832153764,0.00165111129172,0.00148137065116,0.00141087046359,0.00140740047209,0.00140740047209,0.00132692733314,0.0012831777567,0.00111900235061,0.00111823517364,0.00111750792712,0.00111750792712,0.00109097186942,0.00104176939931,0.00104071223177"

My first complaint is the bar staff. NO ONE SMILED!!!!! NO ONE!!!! Not even the management whom I assumed were management because they were in suits.Afer getting our drinks I asked to see the menu. Upon given the menu the bartender told us we couldn't get any food until 5:00pm, the kitchen is closed.I detest when I get told what I can't have instead of what I can have. Clearly there wasn't even a nut or and olive to be offered up!We were going to leave but the sky opened up and it started to pour so we had no choice but to stay and wait it out. We decided we'd get something to eat so we asked again for the menu. We're now told that NO food is served at the bar, SOOOO I asked for a table. It's now 4:45 and I noticed that a table that had just been seated were being offered an antipasto cart of cheese and meats and olives. I asked the waitstaff if we could get a plate from this cart and I was told that I couldn't. The reason this table was being offered the cart was because they paid for a PRIFIX before arriving.I really didn't understand that reply but I shrugged it off. It was very clear we had to wait until 5:00pm to order food!Now while sitting at our table and waiting for the 5 o'clock hour to strike I notice the waiter with the cart going to each person at the BAR and offering them food from the antipasto cart!!!OK so let's review.........NO FOOD until 5:00pmNO Eating at the barWe can't have the antipasto because apparently we hadn't prepaid for it!!!!!!!!OMG!!!!

I love going to places that are close to my apartment and have been wanting to check out La Sirena for a while.  After an event I was starving and in need of wine and we found ourselves at the luxe spacious bar sipping some wine while waiting for a table to open up.  Once we were seated my dining companion and I decided to try a few things.  We started with the fresh buricotta which is a decadent and creamy cheese that melted in my mouth.   We also got the crudo which was standard and fresh.  I'm a pasta/carb whore so I had to go in for it and get at least two.  The cavatelli with spare ribs was hearty and delicious.  We also adored the panzotti with leeks, cheese and a brown butter sauce, totally my kind of pasta dish.  We rounded the meal out with the duck breast medium rare which was also great.  All in all it was a great Italian meal where I needed to be carted out of the resto, thank god it's a short walk home.  I definitely will be back to check out brunch outside now that it's getting warmer.This place gets packed so if you don't want to wait I would make a reservation even though it's a large space.  The crowd is lots of trendy twenty and thirty-somethings plus some older business dinners and tourists.  Definitely dress to impress.",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.600000023842,10.6999998093,"pasta/carb whore,meal,fashionplate,buricotta,places,resto,eyelash sweater,Maritime Hotel,Batali,Fall,brunch,apartment,table,crudo,wine,wine,things,bar,need,event,cavatelli,reservation,cheese,dining companion,mouth,ribs,kind,pasta dish,leeks,panzotti,brown butter sauce,duck breast,La Sirena,home,place,lots,crowd,space,business dinners,tourists,dress,meal,resto,god,Italian","6,7,6,7,2,2,7,2,1,7,7,2,7,7,6,6,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,2,1,2","0.372400015593,0.103111200035,0.10286988318,0.0572824627161,0.0475299470127,0.0419380478561,0.027968686074,0.0219528153539,0.0219528153539,0.0219528153539,0.0188064258546,0.0176585130394,0.0108877429739,0.010108307004,0.00769818481058,0.00769818481058,0.00752223655581,0.0067378799431,0.0067378799431,0.0067378799431,0.00491243228316,0.00487526552752,0.0046950886026,0.0045355623588,0.00452277017757,0.00411468558013,0.00410855421796,0.00410855421796,0.00410855421796,0.00410855421796,0.00410855421796,0.00409297738224,0.00353625020944,0.00306256744079,0.0026795794256,0.0026250674855,0.00259201554582,0.00211845687591,0.00211630878039,0.00211630878039,0.0021143220365,0.00153769657481,0.00153583963402,0.0013267530594,0.000795344123617"

The service was incredible. The food and wine was delicious to boot. We ordered and ranked the below tapas:Paella croquetas (B) not my favorite but okay. Slightly odd aftertaste but did have some elements of a paella. Could have been prepared more flavorful.Patatas bravas (A-) classic Spanish tapa and was definitely not a disappointment. A great compliment to our tapas and was very filling with a large portion. A- simply because it didn't taste exactly the way I remember in Spain but come on, it's NYC! Lol. Still a great complement. Blackened pulpo (B+) very flavorful and had great texture. The fillers in the dish (olives and strawberries) were different and didn't mesh well with me tbh. Purely subjective. The octopus was great and filling though!Iberian cured meats charcutterie(A+) a definite classic and the star of the show.

They brought them wrong Bottle to the table twice, they up sold us on a more expensive wine and then brought two different bottles that they opened to the table.The actual food was good, nothing amazing but solid, the pasta was particularly good. Then it was time for the dessert to come. It most have been at least 30 minutes between when they places the dessert menus on the table and when they came to to check on us. At least the last 20 minutes of that the menus were closed and we were doing everything we could to get he attention of the staff.Then we get the bill and it's wrong, they over charged us by $35 because they billed everything ala carte instead of the prefix we orders, we even had a few minutes conversation with the waiter about how it worked. When we pointed this out to him, he looked confused and then told us we had not participated, we assured him we did and he said the entire table had to participate and we had not.We then asked to speak to a manager and he finally came to the table 10-15 minutes later and we explained the situation to him. He said he would look into it and get back to us. He came back to the table a little while later and explained to us that we had in fact not ordered the pre fix because we ordered 3 pastas instead of 2, not sure how it looked at the bill for 10 minutes and came to this concussion. He was totally wrong about this and when we went over the receipt item by item with him it was pretty clear we had in fact ordered 2. He then took off the $35 that was over charged and nothing beyond that.I have never seen management in what wants to consider themselves a top restaurant handle a situation so poorly.Very disappointed, the manager did give us his card and told us to let him know when we came back.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193620,"I loved the space, but the entire experience was very interesting. This is what I mean by interesting: After we got sat, we had to wait a little under 10 min for someone to bring us a menu and water.  After the menus came, the waitress started reciting the highlights and the titles in the menu from memory, as if it wasn't all written in the menu already. I love that the menu includes descriptions and prices, as most upscale places think it's cute to leave out details in their menu, not the case at La Sirena, they were very thorough with everything. After that awkward menu presentation where the lady recited what was already on the page, we were brought a bread basket with butter on the side topped with sea-salt - another great touch, because we were starving at this point. After four people came to our table (different people were : the hostess, water, bread, menus) we were finally able to order from our waitress (fifth person to come to our table)  There were too many people for no reason in the small area we were in.  The waitress gave us her advice when we asked, and she gave her approval of certain dishes, too- very knowledgable staff.We ordered the fried seafood and veggies to start- It was very delicious. Too small- with only a few pieces of calamari, 1 jumbo shrimp, and a few pieces of veggies-  but the special lemony/citrus sauce was delicious!!  For the pasta / primi dish, we ordered the cavatelli semolina pasta, which included small pieces of pork spare ribs in tomato sauce- the BEST choice of the evening - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLATE!!  The second plates we ordered were the special of the day on Sunday and the duck. The special of the day was basically fried pork skin (for any Latinos reading this, the chicharrón on the menu is actually what you would expect chicharrón to be). The waitress explained what it was before I confirmed my order and I still went ahead with it thinking I'd love the fried pork shoulder.  When it came out, the dish was garnished with what looked like pork rinds from a bag of potato chips, and the actual meat itself was too much juicy/undercooked fat for me so I didn't finish it.  My partner's next plate was the DUCK with swiss chard. When the duck came out we tried it, and it felt like we were in heaven. I'll definitely go back for the cavatelli, and the duck and maybe to try something more basic like the chicken, but I did not enjoy the chicharrones.  We were too full for dessert, so I'm definitely going back to try their desserts. tl;dr- The long wait to get the menus was awkward, but the DUCK and the CAVATELLI was worth it all in the end.",4.0 star rating,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,10.3000001907,"menus,plate,experience,space,menu,waitress,details,waitress,menu,menu,meat,waitress,water,someone,memory,titles,highlights,menu presentation,advice,semolina pasta,menu,menu,bread basket,menus,places,special,lady,everything,case,prices,descriptions,page,people,duck,dishes,pieces,pieces,lemony/citrus sauce,pork,pasta / primi dish,pieces,water,bread,table,table,veggies,veggies,menus,dish,tomato sauce,PLATE,side,butter,sea-salt,touch,point,hostess,area,reason,seafood,staff.,approval,jumbo shrimp,calamari,choice,ribs,special,something,desserts,La Sirena,wait,cavatelli,potato chips,bag,pork rinds,partner,swiss chard,heaven,chicken,chicharrones,people,people,dessert,CAVATELLI,menu,chicharrón,chicharrón,end,dr,order,waitress,pork shoulder,pork skin,Latinos","7,7,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,5,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,1","0.121413141489,0.0760664045811,0.0443189442158,0.038602989167,0.0375234670937,0.0355594865978,0.0337954051793,0.0332931466401,0.0308705195785,0.0266762375832,0.0249764174223,0.0218872856349,0.0202683284879,0.0202683284879,0.0176516119391,0.0176516119391,0.0176516119391,0.0170585457236,0.0137020004913,0.01290987432,0.0118271531537,0.0117841893807,0.00885892100632,0.00791895203292,0.00770990317687,0.00756160821766,0.00696450052783,0.00672379555181,0.00672379555181,0.00672379555181,0.00672379555181,0.00670481752604,0.00628053350374,0.00589736783877,0.00566409388557,0.00565451895818,0.00565451895818,0.00562025234103,0.00556101091206,0.00516685424373,0.00516685424373,0.00516199367121,0.00516199367121,0.00516199367121,0.00516199367121,0.00515192002058,0.0051432098262,0.00476485164836,0.00475454423577,0.00469958875328,0.00455184979364,0.00452687824145,0.00452687824145,0.00452687824145,0.00452687824145,0.00452687824145,0.00451642973348,0.00451642973348,0.00451642973348,0.00450761476532,0.00450761476532,0.00450761476532,0.0044999923557,0.0044999923557,0.0041117919609,0.0041117919609,0.0041013462469,0.0040071727708,0.00400409428403,0.00398153765127,0.00361632299609,0.00348560721613,0.00305756693706,0.00305756693706,0.00305756693706,0.00305469543673,0.00305469543673,0.00305202440359,0.00285580358468,0.00281982170418,0.00245827785693,0.00245827785693,0.00241131172515,0.002409564564,0.0023573928047,0.0022266341839,0.0022266341839,0.00210803397931,0.00210803397931,0.00141203729436,0.00140424829442,0.00139423960354,0.00134366285056,0.000795205705799"

Once our waiter came to take our order we began to tell him which two pastas we each wanted.  And then he told us that we could only select two pastas for all 3 of us to share! (and there would be enough food for all of us)  We told him that was not how it's done in Italy.  A ""bis"" is for an individual, not for sharing.  When reading the menu, we really did not understand why it said ""with the participation of the entire table"".  We interpreted this as ""every person has to order two pastas"".  That did not make much sense because of our experience in Italy, each person who orders a ""bis"" is not dependent on anyone else's order.  As a matter of fact, one of the purposes of a ""bis"" in Italy is so that you don't have to share with others - you just get more variety on your own plate!  We wound up just ordering individual dishes of pasta, which were all excellent!",4.0 star rating,"Bronx, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,12.3999996185,"Italy,restaurant,plate,pastas,menu,dining companions,food,dishes,Some,atmosphere,service,item,heaven,pastas,pastas,Bis of Pastas,tastes,bis,bis,person,New York City,waiter,restaurant,Italian,pastas,pastas,bis,tris,tris,pastas,pastas,pasta lover,times,menu,menu,menu,table,restaurant,order,bis,table,participation,any,description,practice,person,total,pasta,table,bis,participation,order,experience,anyone,one,bis,variety,United States,dishes,plate,sense,purposes,others,fact,matter,food,all,sharing,individual","2,2,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,2,1,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.0770838558674,0.0696114897728,0.0591372959316,0.0421429425478,0.0353500545025,0.0345919430256,0.0303197968751,0.0301652122289,0.026545194909,0.0263140592724,0.0262400768697,0.0261797830462,0.0248631071299,0.023743737489,0.0237121768296,0.0218912716955,0.0179487261921,0.0169445145875,0.0169193018228,0.0162090547383,0.0157444067299,0.015523314476,0.0138003295287,0.0133620267734,0.0124158607796,0.0123916640878,0.0118427025154,0.0114036314189,0.0113714672625,0.0113311344758,0.011321881786,0.00997887551785,0.00997887551785,0.00907535478473,0.00906535983086,0.00864975526929,0.00842312350869,0.0084145879373,0.00813298113644,0.00772966910154,0.00768664898351,0.00766170443967,0.00670378468931,0.00670378468931,0.00669070333242,0.00621162122115,0.00611744215712,0.00582959735766,0.00572252832353,0.00534966401756,0.00520495930687,0.00519867520779,0.0045483992435,0.0045483992435,0.00440638000146,0.00416174298152,0.00405567232519,0.00397358182818,0.00396944163367,0.00395522313192,0.00352970696986,0.00314725982025,0.00314725982025,0.00314725982025,0.00314725982025,0.00280024227686,0.00251344451681,0.00199850648642,0.00199850648642"
La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,147610,"I was a little slow to go, but I finally made my first visit to La Sirena since it was La Bottega. The space is completely transformed and the bar is beautiful with a great list of cocktails. (When the New Wave Paloma called my name, I was sure to answer. I'd never miss a cocktail that has a hint of habanero...!) The space as a whole came out beautifully and the dining room we were in was low lit giving it a mellow, sexy vibe. It was SO low lit though, that I needed my phone to read the menu. As a group of four, we started with a dozen oysters with the usual accoutrements, the garlic grilled shrimp, and the crudo; we paired that with a white wine from the Campania region. The apps were all good, but nothing really jumped out at me and the crudo would have been better had it been sliced thinner. I then had the squid ink pasta with lobster, ramps, and jalapeño. (It was my cheat night, and I was at a B&B restaurant after all...) This too was good, but didn't blow me away the dishes at Babbo and Del Posto have (with emphasis on the former...) My husband opted for the lasagna with fresh peas. He typically goes for a meat, but can rarely pass up the promise of a solid lasagna. He felt that it was fine enough. Moving on...

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,4493,"Such high hopes for this new Mario Batali restaurant.  It opened 5 months late and was allegedly way over budget, as most openings are. Such is life in NYC with new restaurants. We are big fans and love most everything else by Chef Batali. Our gut reaction to our experience is, completely underwhelmed. The service was not up to par but when we found out that they have only been open for 6 weeks, we began to somewhat reconsider.  The pace was extremely slow and everyone else around seemed to get a lot more attention than us. We constantly had to ask other members of the staff for things like napkins and dessert menus. We were given dinner sized plates with our appetizers and weren't offered bread until just before our pastas arrived, while everyone had been offered it long before. All of that aside, the food...  For appetizers we had the burrata and vongole orreganata which were both very good. We had two pastas, the bucatini and the pici. The bucatini was good but the pici left much to be desired. The sausage and escarole weren't very flavorful. If they were going for extremely subtle flavors then cudos, but I was expecting more. When we learned from the manager Joe that they have only been open for 6 weeks we decided to assume that the lack of excellent service is growing pains and not racism.  Joe was amazingly do was the only saving grace of this experience. He could sense our frustration with our experience and took care of our drinks. He offered other things to appease us but we were over it and just ready to go at that point. We plan to go back once a little time has passed. We really want this restaurant to be excellent and succeed.

At the end we received complimentary sorbet and a glass of effervescent desert wine which was delicious (would have preferred a discount on the food but whatever).

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,89529,"This was an excellent restaurant. From the food to the service, everything was extremely top notch. I would imagine it would be even better during the summer months while the patio is open. I started with the burrata which was extremely tasty. I would suggest sharing this with at LEAST one other, as it was quite rich/heavy. Afterwards we shared orders of the lasagna, pasta with the spicy tomato sauce and a pasta with mushroom dish that the kitchen made special for us, being that we are vegetarian.

The Fingerling Potatoes, the Heirloom Tomatoes AND the Octopus. I do not do tentacles but the Heirlooms were good and the Fingerlings were AWESOME. Honestly, I did not want to overdo it on my entree' as we would be hoofing around town and my large 13 feet were already yelping.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,20785,"Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali's newly-opened jointly-founded restaurant. This was a highly-anticipated meal, after hearing that this would open in Fall 2015, so we were glad to finally get the chance to try this. Not to mention, La Sirena is a 2-minute walk from my apartment, so getting there during the snow and wind would prove to be a breeze (no pun intended).I managed to get a last-minute reservation for President's Day, after unsuccessfully trying to get one for Valentine's Day. The ambiance is very trendy and modern, consistent with the neighboring Tao Downtown and adjacent Maritime Hotel. Even in business casual attire, I actually felt mildly under-dressed, likely because of the hyper-attractive hostesses and the many roaming FOH managers in suits. Oh well. While waiting for our table, I sat at the huge bar in the lobby, which was brightly lit and stocked with all sorts of ingredients. The cocktail menu was very inventive, and I started off with the Spicy Little Number, which was Stranahan's whiskey, ancho chile liqueur, and pear juice. The drink was spicy, sweet, and strong, and all very well-balanced, complete with the clear perfectly sculpted square ice cubes. After that, I went with my usual old-fashioned, which was also expertly-made, and very, very strong. I was definitely feeling it after 2 drinks, but I maintained my composure. Somewhat. The hostess led us to the main dining area through the archway to the left of the bar. I saw that there was a whole dining area to the right of the bar, but I'm assuming that will be open later. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable, and very patient with our questions. After waiting at the bar for a substantial amount of time and drinking up an appetite, we kinda went crazy with our order.What we ordered:- Short Rib Carpaccio: Tiny portion, but still absolutely delicious, and loaded with black truffle- Duck Mezzalune with Marinara: On the salty side, but very hearty and rich, loaded with duck- Bucatini with Polipo all'Arrabbiata: Pasta had the perfect chew, and very tender octopus- Beef Braciole with Broccoli Rabe and spicy bread crumbs: Short rib was braised nicely, and the bread crumbs provided a great crunchy contrast- Brasato di Vitello (Veal Brisket) with potato puree & salsa verde: Delicious and fatty, especially with the salsa verde- Cauliflower Carbonara: creamy, tender, and full of delicious pancetta bits- Honey Walnut Semifreddo: A very interesting and unique mix of different textures and flavors including orange sorbet and candied fennelService, as previously mentioned, was excellent with recommendations, ensuring that we were confident in our choices, and that our drinks were quickly refilled. I was very impressed with the pace and how smoothly everything went throughout the meal, again, given that it's only been a few days. The prices are easily on the expensive side, so perhaps it's not the place to frequent, but definitely good for a nice dinner. The cocktails were delicious and well-made, but at about $16-18 a cocktail, incredibly pricey, so keep that in mind if you're going to the bar for drinks.Reservations are taken up to 15 days ahead of time, only through the phone for now. I'm very keen to try their brunch/lunch menu, once it's finally available. Obviously, as it is early days, I'll be interested to see how everything evolves with La Sirena, both menu-wise and service-wise, and I'm certain it will happen quickly.

I was in NYC for a girls weekend and was excited to try his latest venture. I went there on Sunday (Mothers Day) with 4 people. However, the experience at La Sirena was mediocre. The bloody Mary was watery, the Mulberry Street' Omelette was bland and the Mezzi Rigatoni Carbonara was not creamy. Additionally, I tweeted my experience to @lasirenany and @mariobatali as I was hoping it would help improve the quality of the food and service but instead of following up with questions or responding to my tweet I was blocked from @mariobatali on Twitter.

I'm writing this only a month afterwards, but to be honest, I don't remember much of dinner because the food was so unmemorable. Here's what I can recall:- Appetizer of tomato, buffalo mozzarella, and eggplant from a cart. Liked this quite a bit actually, especially the eggplant which was very savory and strong.- Quail alla Piastra was average...the small 'rack' we were served + lack of flavors certainly did not warrant its price. On a presentation note, I also thought it odd how they covered up all the quail with a bed of greens.- Galletto al Mattone - chicken was alright but I don't remember any semblance of black truffle.  The gnocco was not what you usually think of as gnocchi.- Service was lovely. The interior was beautiful and grand as can be but felt hollow somehow. The decor did not add to the experience.

The service was also great. Our waiter was very friendly, our water was always refilled, drinks were delivered in a timely manner...all the details you'd expect from a smart restaurant.I must say I was a little disappointed in the food, however. I've come to expect a lot from Mario Batali and La Sirena just didn't measure up. I started with the crispy softshell crab, and it was just okay. The flavor wasn't really there and the smashed potatoes it came with were dry. My friend had the buricotta appetizer, which was better than mine but still not anything I'd crave. The cheese was fresh and well made but again, the flavor wasn't anything dynamite.For a main course I have the cavetelli with short ribs. The short ribs were tough and chewy. The cavatelli was fine but I was wishing I had more of it. My friend had the ravioli with pancetta, tomato, and pecorino, and it was the star of the show. I would go back for that ravioli alone.Dessert was the bomboloni with pineapple. The donuts themselves were perfect but the pineapple and accompanying sauce were lackluster--sweet for sweet's sake without much flavor. The sauce drowns out the acidity of the pineapple.They have a great wine selection--my pinot noir by the glass was very tasty and perfect.Overall I'm not sure I'll go back--maybe for a different season's menu, but I'd really rather go to Babbo, Eataly or Del Posto.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,6.90000009537,"flavor,place,decor,atmosphere,stars,friend,service,waiter,softshell crab,appetizer,drinks,details,food,restaurant.,manner,water,lot,star,cheese,anything,anything,cavatelli,short ribs,course,cavetelli,more,flavor,pineapple.,pinot noir,sauce,sauce,sake,wine selection,acidity,Mario Batali,La Sirena,season,menu,glass,short ribs,potatoes,pineapple,pineapple,bomboloni,show,pecorino,tomato,pancetta,ravioli,Dessert,Del Posto,Eataly,Babbo,donuts","7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7","0.159733697772,0.0818797200918,0.0788800567389,0.0788800567389,0.0642457827926,0.0507919676602,0.0451123081148,0.0448833294213,0.0293761566281,0.0292518921196,0.0271359942853,0.0153748290613,0.0144329909235,0.0144329909235,0.0144329909235,0.0144329909235,0.0138452565297,0.013390224427,0.0114968651906,0.0110232532024,0.0107295997441,0.0104925446212,0.0100716212764,0.00881328247488,0.00881328247488,0.00878841616213,0.00822415016592,0.00821643508971,0.00780842266977,0.00748084578663,0.00747382687405,0.00654567917809,0.00653953664005,0.00653953664005,0.00575418537483,0.00575418537483,0.00452843075618,0.00452843075618,0.00452843075618,0.00435857847333,0.00418868428096,0.00361260701902,0.00356347789057,0.0030628007371,0.00287782261148,0.00287782261148,0.00287782261148,0.00287782261148,0.00287782261148,0.00287464912981,0.0026808376424,0.0026808376424,0.0026808376424,0.00124338676687"
La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,17642,"Came during NYFW (New York Fashion Week), for a free happy hour event hosted by the Maritime Hotel in downtown. My girlfriends and I, being our first fall in New York, were scrounging around and looking for events to go to and found this per a suggestion from one of my friends' family members. We decided check it out after school, since it was a nice day and free alcohol, come on! Let me start off by saying that this hotel is absolutely gorgeous, with such a old-time feel (think plush leather chairs, bookshelves with books, dimly lit and soft-spoken front desk staff) but managed to still make the accommodations and restaurant/patio area feel very sleek and modern. We headed to the front desk asking about the free event, to which they directed us across the hallway to the patio where the event was being held. It was mainly hotel guests, enjoying a drink and the sunshine on a nice New York afternoon but we didn't feel out of place at all. They had a cab, a white, and a grapefruit-vodka drink at hand, with two bar stations for us to get drinks at. Of course, we tipped after every drink we got - it was just a beautiful setting for us to enjoy each others' company, and they even came around with food samplers!

I set up a business dinner there and the reservations staff was very patient and accommodating about a few last minute changes.  The bar is breathtaking and was a lovely place to wait for our table -- not that we had to do much waiting, as we were seated within ten minutes of our reservation time.  Our server was the right balance of friendly, engaging, and professional and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  I wish I remembered her name because I would love to give her a shout-out! My favorite dishes were pasta, especially the pici, but the orata (which I ordered at our server's suggestion) was delightful too.  My dining companions all raved about their food as well.  And the atmosphere was sophisticated and chic yet laid back at the same time.  This may be my new favorite restaurant in the city.  Bravo!",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",1,0,0.800000011921,8.89999961853,"food,La Sirena,balance,service,space,staff,dining companions,reservations,business dinner,waiting,bar,place,changes,table,menu,orata,server,atmosphere,food,suggestion,restaurant,city,name,pasta,pici,Bravo!,dishes","7,1,7,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,3,7","0.499159395695,0.0742688030005,0.0672003477812,0.06141442433,0.0490645319223,0.0224257819355,0.0218196026981,0.0214699245989,0.0187984835356,0.0156976953149,0.015500782989,0.0134904403239,0.0127107286826,0.0126646086574,0.0115596987307,0.0114823477343,0.0108085479587,0.010240030475,0.00981648080051,0.00860541220754,0.00726707233116,0.00593443866819,0.00589778879657,0.00377806089818,0.00377806089818,0.00351019669324,0.00163631793112"

I came in with a standard expectation for most Michelin starred restaurants but this one definitely was on the lower end of the ones I have been to. For an appetizer, I got the melanzana, which was mushy and pretty bland for something that had a chili broth. I would probably not order it again if I came back. For my main course, I got the tagliatelle and then split the garganelli with a friend. Both were decent dishes, but definitely not anything that kept me raving about once my meal was finished. To drink, I got a beer from what I would consider their biggest strength, which was an extensive beer list with beers from all over NY state and elsewhere. I was happy to find an upscale place actually have a beer list since I am not much of a wine guy. I also got a cocktail which was great, don't remember the name off the top of my head. The service was pretty good, but we were looked over a lot, probably because we were a group of young kids at a nicer restaurant, but things like water and simple requests for an additional plate took longer than necessary.

It's very spacious with large bar area with seatings and a good sized main dining room in a separate room. The bar area is very nice, can get quite loud and busy. During the holidays, the outside entrance is surrounded with large lite pine trees, giving it an enchanted winter forest feel. The restaurant has floor to ceiling glass walls, so you can see the beautiful setting outside while being in the restaurant. Very magical and beautiful effect. Food - great selections of Italian dishes. Very tasty and dishes were well executed. We had the burrata as starter, bis of pastas for two (highly recommend) and tried the Pumpkin Agnolotti and Cavatelli with Spare Ribs, and shared the pork entree and roasted brussels sprouts as side.Service - very nice, accommodating and guest experience focused staffs.

I called ahead to let them know I was entertaining a very important client and requested that we sit in a section where the service would be top notch.  Of course we had the opposite experience, we had to continuously search for our waiter, drinks were brought to the table incomplete and one person was always waiting for their drink while the others had theirs.  We asked for more bread, it never came.  All of the courses seemed rushed, the main course took forever to arrive.  I had such high hopes but part of what makes a restaurant great is consistency.  Maybe the place is just too big to expect this, but last night was a big disappointment.  The food was just ok, some of it was hot, other mains room temperature.  Everything we asked for we had to wait and wait.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193555,"Good, but not great Mario Batalia restaurant.  Had dinner there on a relatively busy evening. Service was very good and some of the food items stood out, but others were just so-so.  We shared several appetizers and a couple of main dishes.  Th e Carne Cruda with Fava Crostino and the Charred Octopus were both excellent. I am not normally a fan of octopus - having had too many rubbery ones.  This was amazing.  Tender texture that you could cut with a fork and flavor that reminded me of lobster.  If it wasn't for the suction cups on the tentacle, I would have sworn it was not octopus. The Crostini Alla Toscana (chicken liver) was the low point of the meal. The Black Spaghetti (squid ink) sounded like it would have a lot of flavors, but was fairly bland.  Cavatelli was just okay.  For dessert, we had the Bomboloni, which was a pleasant end to the meal.  Overall a good experience, but I will probably not go back.",3.0 star rating,"Dallas, TX",1,1,0.20000000298,7.40000009537,"restaurant,Mario Batalia,Service,dinner,some,Black Spaghetti,texture,fork,Bomboloni,Crostini Alla Toscana,appetizers,food items,couple,dishes,octopus,flavor,fan,ones,lobster,suction cups,tentacle,flavors,Charred Octopus,lot,Fava Crostino,dessert,others,Th e,meal,Cavatelli,experience,meal,Carne Cruda","2,2,7,4,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.138229459524,0.0828880891204,0.0791093856096,0.0667706280947,0.0664333030581,0.0561794340611,0.0522603802383,0.0432943478227,0.0370479635894,0.0325120463967,0.0292694624513,0.025571687147,0.0254790652543,0.0254790652543,0.0208758041263,0.0195089615881,0.0171382371336,0.0171382371336,0.0156300049275,0.0156067488715,0.0156067488715,0.0132980858907,0.0127895427868,0.0116375945508,0.0116346552968,0.0116130188107,0.0111051294953,0.0101813757792,0.00919335894287,0.00822259765118,0.00803689844906,0.00584619119763,0.0044124815613"

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193744,"We visited La Sirena for brunch last Sunday.  It was a dear friend's birthday and we had all been wanting to try La Sirena - I was thrilled to find a reservation for 8 at 2pm.  All of us have had marvelous experiences at other Batali restaurants so we expected nothing less.  I was running a bit late and arrived at 2:10 - my friends were at the bar.  I checked in and said we would be 7 instead of 8 and that it was our friends birthday - the hostess told me she was getting our table set up.  The last of our party arrived at 2:15 - we were all seated at the bar and waiting for our table.  First issue:  our friend Nicolas had ordered a bloody mary which was so spicy he couldn't drink it.  After flagging down the bartender (who moved at a snails pace) he complained.  The bartender said, ""well that's just how we make them..."" and did not offer any solution.  Nicolas asked if he could make it less spicy and the bartender said once again, ""no that's how they are made.""  This seemed odd to me as I had watched the bartender combine the elements to form the base mix - surely he could have been more helpful.  Nicolas ended up ordering a plain grapefruit juice.Now it's 2:30.  Everyone is hungry.  I walk up to the hostess stand and inquire about our table.  Once again I was told that they were getting it ready.  Now it's 2:45.  Everyone is starving.  I walk up to the hostess stand again and ask about the table...they seem flustered and say it is almost ready.  I see plenty of tables in the restaurant.  I sit back down and then see the man who I assume is the manager walk by - I flag him down (and honestly he should have stopped by already at this point).  I say that we have been waiting for 45 minutes.  He unapologetically says, ""I was told your party was incomplete."" I say he is incorrect and the hostesses knew that we were all here for 30 minutes.  He NEVER says I'm sorry and just walks away.  That is the last we see of him - besides the multiple times he walks by throughout the rest of our experience, but never stops by to apologize or offer any type of consolation.  Now it's 2:55 and they finally ready to seat us.  Everyone is pissed and our happy birthday celebration has taken a bad turn.  We sit down at the table, no one comes.  5 minutes later we finally ASK for our menus.  We get the menus...no one comes.  There's plenty of people working in the dining room, but no one seems to care that we are sitting there waiting intently to order something - anything at this point.  I finally flag down a waiter (seriously?) and ask if he can take our oder.  It's sometime after three at this point and we put in the entire order - drinks, apps, entrees - we have had PLENTY of time to decide.  Another 20 minutes goes by and we get our bread basket...but still no drinks.  I ask the waiter about them - says they are coming.  It took 30 minutes to get drinks so I order another when they arrive because surely I will be done by the time my next is ready - my thoughts were correct.My partner complains again to the hostess as she walks by - he is received warmly, but it seems that his words fell on deaf ears.  The manager NEVER stops by.  I am aghast.  One would think a round of drinks would be offered - dessert perhaps?  Nope.The food comes - by this point we are all so over this experience that we'd be happier at the diner around the corner.  The food was fine - mediocre at best.  Portions were unsurprisingly small, eggs when ordered ""runny"" came out hard - too late to complain at this point as we are ready to eat the tablecloth.We inhale our food and the waiter brings over the single dessert offering - we order one piece that we are charged for - they put a candle in it.  We pay the bill - not a thing was comped, not even an apology was spent on us.  As we leave we ask for the manager's card - one would think this was a simple request.  The hostess tries to skirt the issue and give us the generic card for the restaurant - or leave to go get the manager's permission (who obviously didn't give a damn and is literally sitting 10 feet away).  We said we didn't have time and would contact him in writing because the rest of our party was waiting outside.  She leaves to speak to the manager and we vent to the other two hostesses and demand his card which they produced immediately.It's not like we were a table of delinquents or people who don't know how to handle themselves.  We are all successful New Yorkers -

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193720,"I have very mixed feelings about this place. I wanted to like it. I really did. I have been looking forward to dining here after months of anticipation and press about the opening. We had a prime time dinner reservation on a Sunday night and the restaurant was 2/3 empty. After being seated in the beautiful dining room we immediately noticed the high noise level. It made a conversation with my friends rather difficult. The screaming child on the table next to us didn't help.My main complaint about La Sirena is the service. It was slow, unprofessional and chaotic at best. We were given courses with missing ingredients, the waiters didn't know where to put the butter plates (it's either left or right - not one person on the left and the other on the right), it was a constant pain to get someones attention (bear in mind that the dining room was almost empty at this point) and waiters consistently put courses in front of the wrong diners. Overall food was good. If service was on point I'd probably give them 4 stars. Portions were huge and quality was good. But the service really made it difficult to enjoy the evening. By the time we got to desert our whole party was just annoyed by the chaos and the constant effort to get someones attention. They were busy with cleaning up the dining room and prepping it for the next day. I understand that this place is rather new, although it has been open for more than 2 months now, so service should have improved. Can't imagine dining here the opening week.

We did not have a reservation. We grabbed a drink at the bar (which is really nice!) and waited for a table. It seems like the restaurant is still gearing up - there is a huge balcony which isnt being used yet (im sure it will be packed during the summer), and there seems to be a LOT of open space in the restaurant. Almost too barren. They can fit 2x the number of tables than there are currently. For now though, its nice that it isnt too crowded and im sure the service is better as a result. You also don't feel like you are sitting on top of the tables next to you -- you can have a full conversation and not be concerned about other people hearing. The food was good, but not GREAT. It was solid. I've had better italian food in NY recently. But La Sirena isnt just about the food for me, its about the neighborhood, proximity to other activities, and the space.

The bar area is particularly attractive though we were seated in an adjacent dining room at a table next to the floor to ceiling windows. The view is only of the projects across the street but it's light and airy and we can tell that they'll probably offer outdoor dining once the weather improves.  The windows were double glazed so we weren't cold despite the chill outside.   Our young Italian waiter, Damiano, was personable and attentive as was the rest of the team  serving us.  There were a couple of minor service missteps but we were satisfied overall.The food was truly excellent!  I had tender flavorful arctic char crudo and my husband had the melt-in-your-mouth short rib Carpaccio.  We split an order of the ravioli filled with tomato and pecorino in a spring onion sauce.  The ravioli were delicate and totally scrumptious.  For our main courses, I had the grilled lamb chops and my husband the Polpette (pork meatballs).  The meatballs were exceptionally soft and tasty, the lamb chops perfectly cooked, tender and delicious.  I enjoyed the crudo with a glass of he Oltrepo Pavese Brut, a very good Italian sparkling wine that also complemented the ravioli, and matched the lamb with a glass of hearty Barolo.  We weren't hungry but had to try the gelato so we shared chocolate and pistachio flavors.  I wasn't impressed with the pistachio but the chocolate was good. I finished with espresso which was served with a small biscotti and a tiny parfait glass filled with whipped cream and topped with a coffee bean coated with chocolate.We still prefer Del Posto in this neighborhood, however La Sirena is a good alternative at a lower price.  We plan to return to try more of the menu items.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.600000023842,11.6999998093,"husband,La Sirena,dinner,decor,performance,reservation,Damiano,lamb chops,windows,bar area,view,espresso,ceiling windows,floor,table,dining room,street,projects,food,dining,ravioli,husband,arctic char crudo,gelato,Oltrepo Pavese Brut,rest,pork meatballs,chocolate,weather,chill,team,service missteps,order,spring onion sauce,pecorino,tomato,courses,chocolate,flavors,more,pistachio,pistachio,biscotti,Italian,Carpaccio,glass,alternative,Polpette,ravioli,cream,coffee bean,neighborhood,price,menu items,meatballs,couple,ravioli,glass,lamb,glass,crudo,Del Posto,Barolo","1,1,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,6,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,6,6,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.229847937822,0.0813038945198,0.0748037397861,0.0435888282955,0.0358236804605,0.0358236804605,0.0244917329401,0.0190436989069,0.0184577237815,0.016653617844,0.0166066978127,0.0157043151557,0.0155430287123,0.0136026283726,0.0136026283726,0.0136026283726,0.013564279303,0.013564279303,0.0108736706898,0.0104700420052,0.0104417912662,0.0104177165776,0.0103924162686,0.0102547965944,0.00986816454679,0.00971904303879,0.00947636552155,0.00926187075675,0.00916170235723,0.00914057251066,0.00912274606526,0.00910733267665,0.00908163189888,0.00831114407629,0.00831114407629,0.00831114407629,0.00829197373241,0.00776326237246,0.00710248947144,0.00708610191941,0.0070614037104,0.00705563183874,0.00616864860058,0.00613484159112,0.00538540398702,0.00536743784323,0.00529837235808,0.00491023343056,0.00451954593882,0.00427125813439,0.00427125813439,0.00427125813439,0.00427125813439,0.00426816381514,0.00410198746249,0.00394607009366,0.00367851438932,0.00340904830955,0.00340904830955,0.00340904830955,0.00306151178665,0.00252840365283,0.0016055193264"

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193693,"I've come to this location since it was La Bottega and was so excited to hear that Mario Battali had taken over. I wanted to love it, I wanted to love it so bad! The atmosphere is great, and the restaurant is beautiful, but the service that evening was a HUGE miss. The evening begins with my friend and I attempting to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. Ten-fifteen minutes later, our table is ready, but we never had the chance to even place an order. Not a major deal, but disappointing considering that the bar was really not even crowded.And then there was our waiter.......Never bothered to greet us. As he abruptly hands us our menu I asked if we could also see the wine list. Without a spoken word, he shoves a tablet onto our table and walks off. After leaving us to figure out how to navigate through the restaurants digital wine menu, he re-appears to take our order. My friend is a pescatarian, and inquires if anything we ordered used chicken stock or contained any meat products. ""No. Now do any of you have any allergies I should know about""? My friend replies ""Yes, to meat products"".  His eyes widen and he takes a step back, ""So you're allergic to meat products?"", ""Yes,"" my friend replied sheepishly.

There were a few minor misses - my end of the table waited awhile for our wine, they forgot to wrap up my food, and the meat in one of the pasta dishes was a little gristly - but overall we had a great time and it was due in large part to the exceptional service. I really enjoyed the heirloom tomato/stracciatella appetizer, and the truffled chicken was delicious. We split the squid ink pasta and one with pork ribs. The squid ink was perfect - strong umami flavors without being too salty. I wish I'd gone with Nonna's olive oil cake for dessert instead of the panna cotta but only because I'd just had amazing Panna Cotta at Wildair and anything else paled in comparison.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,49,"Some restaurants, when it first opened, you will bookmark it right away following the media; and then you just need to wait for that special moment to come in order to get a taste out of it. La Sirena was certainly among this group.So my friend and I arrived just on time and were thus seated promptly. Service was nothing but flawless. Our waiter brought us to our table and gave a detailed explanation to both the wine list and the food menu. We decided to share a bit of appetizers, and each get the main dish. I love my squid ink pasta with lobster meat and garlic! The firmness of the noodles was just about right, and the garlic flavor added on top had somehow created a refreshing taste! No matter what, don't skip the dessert! The nut tart with raisin was so impressive! The crunchiness of the crust simply made a perfect combo with the gelato on top - as you could feel both pop up in your mouth, amazing!I would not be satisfied with only one visit to La Sirena, as I was still missing many other dishes that were probably among the best on the list.

She waved her hand in their direction and said ""they're over there, enjoy!""  Bad start. Service was chaotic. It took sometime to figure out who our server was. People swarmed the table but never really knew what to do or what plates to set where. I hate plate roulette.  One appetizer was missing. One entree was missing. For both courses they offered to quickly prep the missing plate - but then one is eating after everyone else?  No thanks. The food, we all agreed, was good, well prepared and presented. The service was just awful. As for the wine list - horrible. Unless you have extensive knowledge of Italian wines, one will be lost swiping through the iPod format list. The prices are way off compared to the price of entrees with most bottles well over $100 and $200 seeming to be the average. We had to ask the sommelier for a recommendation for a good red at $75. He could come up with one - at $80. If one is to use an iPod there is the option to provide a detailed description of each wine; sorting by price; by taste or body. This one is sorted by region and variety with NO explanation or description of any label. Impossible.  And pages upon pages of this. Give us 20 good bottles priced reasonably and we'll be sure to drink more. Fix your service issues & wine list and maybe we'll be back.

We sat in the dining room and learned they were only serving brunch. Snacks and drinks doesn't equal brunch in my mind. I wish the hostesses had let us know that. We ordered drinks and toast with prosciutto. The waitress came back and said she learned the kitchen closed at 3:30. (So why did they seat us after 3:30?) She did say they would take care of us.

My son had the bucatini. He ordered another one and ate two plates! I tried it and I understand why. It was AMAZING!. I had the branzino. Truly amazing. We had cauliflower with pancetta. It was amazing. My wife had the lobster which was only $20. I don't understand how they can sell a $20 full lobster, but somehow they do. That was my least favorite. But I still tried it and liked it. Sommelier was super knowledgable about wine. She recommended a light, minerally italian bottle (and I can't tell you how much I appreciate that she is recommending a $60 bottle not a $600 bottle off the gate). We didn't like it. She sensed it, came back, asked a few more questions, understood our taste and immediately brought another, similarly priced but more full bodied bottle. It was excellent. They never charged for the first one. We had two deserts. The pineapple with gelato and my daugher had a chocolaty desert. I don't like chocolate but I tried a small piece before it was fully gone. It was amazing also. The setting is also amazing. We requested seating outside and sat at the patio. Beautiful people, very chic, vibrant street action right in front of us.

The lamb chops were a bit on the 'lamby' side but the short ribs were amazing.    Ordered a couple of desserts - the crema al cioccolato was delish.The service was pretty slow, but given they were short staffed, I guess that made sense.  They did give us a round of muscato and a dessert on the house due to the delay, which was a very nice gesture.  But it would have been a nicer gesture if they comped a round of drinks or a dessert we actually ordered, rather than give us something we didn't really want/need.Not impressed with this resto and not rushing back.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,-0.20000000298,9.30000019073,"star spot,burrata,place,mode,Communication,gesture,stars,food,explanation,resto,way,customer service,way,artichoke salad,host,something,time foods,part,reviews,dollar signs,humans,diners,resto staff,service,desserts,dessert,al cioccolato,sense,couple,crema,house,muscato,tables,resto,dessert,round,round,Batali,drinks,gesture,something,pieces,octopus,kick,side,bit,sirena,Bucatani,short ribs,lamb chops","7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,1,7,7","0.392972171307,0.0941390767694,0.0750425085425,0.0722847208381,0.041730709374,0.0368780121207,0.0122198984027,0.0120073920116,0.0114042554051,0.0101187089458,0.0101174619049,0.0100574372336,0.0100574372336,0.00958922412246,0.00957906525582,0.00919066742063,0.00919066742063,0.00883276294917,0.00881553720683,0.00881553720683,0.00881553720683,0.00881553720683,0.00881553720683,0.00816250685602,0.00751544488594,0.0075083929114,0.00667402241379,0.00598121713847,0.00598121713847,0.00598121713847,0.00597560266033,0.00597560266033,0.00571928592399,0.0051949233748,0.0051949233748,0.00509840156883,0.00485059758648,0.00476932991296,0.00413397699594,0.00380900572054,0.00335542857647,0.00262927403674,0.00262927403674,0.00262927403674,0.0026263743639,0.0026263743639,0.00165810156614,0.00155620649457,0.00113707990386,0.00113707990386"

They did not take our drink orders for 20 minutes, then when they did serve them, forgot 3 of them. So didn't receive our drinks for 40 minutes.  We were then given other tables appetisers TWICE. and no one seemed to think it was a problem. We were then given the wrong dinner. Something was going wrong. We did complain to the manager, and they still continued to make mistakes - we then started receiving double orders of our dinner. I Had the orata picatta and my husband had the four course tasting which we both thought were amazing. But after all the constant issues throughout the night, the manager did not take one item off the bill, but we received every kind of desert (so they couldn't mess that up because it's everything they had to offer).

Fact is, this gorgeous new restaurant was pretty mediocre in the food department and significantly overpriced, in my local New Yorker opinion. It's more corporate card-carrying, tourist hotspot than neighborhood regulars' restaurant. The pros: -The cocktails! True craftsmanship and creativity. I ordered one cocktail on the menu and one off. The bartender's creativity had me liking the off-menu cocktail even more. $17 each. -Service was excellent too! This is important. -Gorgeous (and huge!!) space. The mosaic marble floors are stunning and carry through to the huge outdoor terrace.The cons: -Price! 3 meatballs, $24. They came highly-recommended by our server. The meatballs were fine; they tasted like meatballs. $22 glasses of cab-least expensive cab by the glass. I can go on about this but if the price was more realistic it's a 4 star restaurant.All in all, this is not a restaurant for New Yorkers who want a place to go on a regular basis. It is in the Meatpacking District after all. La Sirena is what you would expect in ""MePa"" and will attract that douche crowd. It's simply not for me and I'll stick to Otto and some of the other lower-key Batali restaurants I've grown to love over the years.To be fair, I went on day 8 of their opening.

The restaurant wasn't too efficient with the coat check; they put them all on the counter near the check and then promptly give us... one ticket for six jackets and a bag.  Hm. Skip to end of the night - they managed to misplace two of the jackets, and took us an extra ten minutes to get working.iPads to order drinks off of - too inefficient with just one passed around a table of 12. Slow service for the drinks (too many complicated mixed drinks with fun names) - Jack and Diet took a while to make it to the table. The service was mixed - one person asked multiple times for a Diet Coke and that took far longer than getting a mixed drink. And getting my jacket knocked off my chair a couple times leaves less than desired steps on my sleeves.The service aside, food was pre fixe for the group, with a starter (we asked for table starters, and they directed us to individual choices instead... hm) - I had the Alici Marinate with Fennel Three Ways, which tasted all the same way. The pasta was the best part of the meal - the squid ink pasta (tonarelli neri) w/ lobster & jalapeno was good, but the Ravioli all'Amatriciana with Spring Onion Butter was even better. Everyone was served the same two pastas (split on the plate).

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193286,Really excellent! I read about la sirena and was very excited to try a new place. I made a reservation for early on a Thursday and we brought out 1 year old. I am not sure why but I wasn't expecting it to be as fancy as it was. Luckily it was loud so when he was babbling aggressively no one noticed. We started with the grilled calamari and burrata which were both very good but a little on the small side. We had ordered a lot of food though so it turned out to be better for us we didn't overeat before the pasta course. We got the spicy octopus pasta as well as the short rib cavatelli and my son got handmade pasta with butter (he has since refused my boxed Annie's Mac and cheese. Jk) All were amazing. I liked the short rib better and my husband liked the octopus. Then (I told you we got a lot) we shared the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly! Service was excellent.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,61,"KenScale: 6.5/10I love most neighborhoods in Manhattan, but Meatpacking is probably not one of my favorites, especially at nighttime. It just feels too clubby, with expensive bars, restaurants and clubs that often charge ridiculous prices and screen guests with big bouncers all over the entrance. Maritime Hotel is almost the epicenter of this scene where men in expensive-looking suits and women in short dresses (even in the winter) would hang out at La Bottega before heading over to Tao downstairs or some other swanky club nearby. Once the star chef Mario Batali and restaurateur Joe Bastianich decided to open a new restaurant in place of La Bottega, I was really hoping that they would bring fresh air to the neighborhood, going beyond a predictable Italian restaurant where people hang out just to hang out, not to eat serious food. While I've had mixed experience at chef Batali's famed Babbo, there is no denying that it has the distinctive color and swagger that made the restaurant so beloved by New Yorkers over a long period of time, and there was no denying that Del Posto is one of my absolute favorites in the city. How did La Sirena measure up to these restaurants? I'm sad (and upset) to report that it lacks any type of flair that would want to make me come back. I've come to this conclusion after visiting this restaurant twice in a single week (which has never happened before by the way). I was hoping that the kitchen would take more risks, but the food at La Sirena not only lacked imaginativeness but was also wildly inconsistent throughout. All my appetizers that I had tried were pedestrian, from the crispy soft shell crab with crushed potatoes, sweet garlic and chives that didn't taste so crispy, to quail with charred ramps, rhubarb vinaigreete and red mustard greens that was more or less forgettable. Only the anchovies with fennel had some semblance of flavor, but wasn't better by much. The pastas were also boring and not really memorable, either. My favorite was bucatini with spicy octopus that had the spicy kick and nice balance of flavor and texture. On the other hand, tonnarelli neri with lobster, ramps and lemony breadcrumbs turned out a bit dull in flavor, as were pici with sausage an escarole and leek and mascarpone stuffed panzotti. I was really starting to miss the absolutely decadent beef's cheek ravioli at Babbo. Even the entrees showed that the kitchen was just playing too safe, and execution was far from perfect. I always enjoy the meaty texture of grilled swordfish, but the one at La Sirena (cooked Sicilian style with olives, tomatoes, currants, capers, pine nuts and marjoram) turned out too soft in texture so I had to really question whether it was swordfish. Braised roll beef short rib with broccoli rabe and spicy bread crumbs was another unimpressive dish that really didn't have a lot of redeeming qualities. The desserts were slightly better. I did quite enjoy the classic ""grandma style"" pine nut tart with olive oil gelato that had the right amount of sweetness without going overboard, and thought the combination of frozen honey mousse and blood orange sorbetto in honey walnut semifreddo worked harmoniously together, even though citrus and Campari-soaked Neapolitan cake with bergamot, grapefruit and basil gelato was, again, boring. Overall, I really wasn't sure how involved chef Batali was to this new venture. Is the restaurant just borrowing his name? Does he even show up at the kitchen and sample various dishes? Despite these shortcomings, getting a reservation at La Sirena is still very difficult to come by, which is even more shocking when you see the gigantic dining space. I wasn't sure whether the restaurant was purposefully withholding reservations. I showed up at 7 p.m. on a Tuesday and was seated at the central bar area immediately without any wait. The Italian-centric wine list on the iPad is large (but pricey), and while the service was professional and attentive, it also felt somewhat distant. As you can imagine, it's the same Meatpacking crowd (I swear I saw at least half a dozen couples of old, rich-looking guys and their hot and slim mistresses), which has made my dining experience even more uncomfortable. La Sirena is probably the best place to just sit at the bar for drinks while munching on some snacks before a wild night elsewhere.

Then lo and behold, a table was ready for us!Trying to wash the lame seating experience out of my mind, the waitress gave us a really nice breakdown of her fave dishes and so we took her on her suggestions and ordered the Buricotta Cheese, Short Rib Carpaccio, Artichoke and Poached Egg Frisee to share. Sadly every bite of every antipasti/salad was totally bland and we had to get some salt to make things taste like something... Ironically when we got our Tonnarelli Lobster & Panzotti pastas, it was overly salty and just a disappointment. Even though I liked our waitress (who never came back btw), her suggestions SUCKED!!By the time the plates were cleared (one guy picked up a plate, then put it back on the edge of our table - teetering on falling off and walked away, causing me to look at another server and openly say ""what's going on?!"" He swiftly cleared the plate and gave me a sheepish smile), I kind of told my friend that this was probably one of the worst dinners I've had in awhile with some of the most lacking training of it's staff.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,5633,"Decided to check out this place with a friend after reading great things about it online. We went for dinner on a Sunday night and were able to be seated right away since this place is HUGE!We were pretty hungry, so we decided to split a couple of dishes:Bread (3 stars): The bread and butter here was pretty average--a good start, but nothing to write home about.Sweet corn and charred beans (4.5 stars): This dish was a lot better than I was expecting and was super sweet and fresh. The only complaint I have with this dish was the size, but otherwise it was very tasty.Bis of pasta (4.5 stars): What an excellent option--two choices of pasta for one price and a very good portion size as well!---Tonnarelli (5 stars): The squid ink pasta with the sauce and lobster is absolutely fantastic. I had only had squid ink pasta once before and was pretty unimpressed, but this rendition was phenomenal. ---Cavatelli (4 stars): This dish was also very good--not quite the depth of flavor as the tonnarelli, but very good nonetheless.Swordfish (4 stars): The swordfish was cooked decently, but I felt that the meat itself was a bit underwhelming as far as flavor goes. That being said, the added ingredients really did a good job of upping the flavor of this dish.Overall, this place served up some great dishes, especially in the first couple of courses. Our service was very friendly, save for an awkward moment with the manager. The ambiance and look of this place is great and is perfect for a date or a large group.

I guess it depends on what you order or the particular servers you get, but the food was outrageously good. I started off with a fennel margarita at the bar and it was fantastic. After hearing some less than stellar reviews of the main entrees, I decided to stick with the meatballs and a pasta dish. The meatballs were very good and the sauce was even better. The kitchen did a really good job with this dish. The star of the show was hands down the Ravioli all' amatriciana with spring onion butter. OMG! These were the best I have had anywhere.

There may have been 20 staff members walking around all night from waiters, hosts, bus boys, & managers. Everyone at our table kept calling someone over to ask for something whether it bread or drinks or anything! There is no customized service and it's a mess in here. Dirty Dishes sat on our table for too long, no one asks if u want a second drink (again u have to call them over constantly). I hate that feeling of no service in a new and pricey restaurant.

The service was great, as were our cocktails, but sadly the food was a disappointment. My first complaint was the very boring bread. It was the kind of every day Italian bread you buy at a grocery store. Where was the crusty, chewy, rustic bread I've had at other Batali restaurants? My husband and I each got salads for appetizers and they were both overdressed, and his was supposed to have shaved Parmesan on it but there were only maybe two shavings. My pasta dish was the cavatelli with spare ribs. The server described it as a pork ragu but it was just pasta and tomato sauce with two tiny knobs that I guess were the spare ribs that each had a little meat and gristle on them. On a positive note my husbands Brasciole was delicious. Lastly, the Chocolate Copetta was very uninspiring. The espresso sponge cake was kind of mushy.  I should have known when there were still plenty of reservations available only two days in advance that I should lower my expectations.

However, the amount of salt used on the food here is absurd. My girlfriends and I ordered the artichokes to start-super tiny dish, dry and so salty we couldn't eat it. Halfway through the meal someone out on 9th avenue started using a jackhammer, so I could no longer even begin to hear what my friends (whom I hadn't seen in weeks) were saying. It was the loudest, most obnoxious, unacceptable situation for a ""nice"" restaurant I've ever had happen to me.  People were getting up and walking out.I finally after nearly an hour received my lambchops and barely got 6 bites off of each chop.

The service was good although I feel the waiters and waitresses need to become more versed with the items on the menu.  For example, our waitress was mispronouncing dishes.  The server was pouring a green sauce on my friends dish and she asked what it was and he replied he didn't know. On to the food... We shared burrata, grilled calamari and got the branzino for two. The grilled calamari was very small. It was mostly broccoli and cauliflower with a few pieces of calamari. The branzino was very good. It says on the menu it comes with the crunchy salad and stinging nettles( the server didn't know what this was). It's not even a salad but a few garnishes on top of the fish. I personally don't like a green sauce on my plate and that was the stinging nettles.  I believe it's puréed spinach so I skipped that. So my entree basically consisted of a piece of branzino with some leaves on top( that is called a salad). They should change what comes with the branzino to make the dish more substantive. The branzino is 70 bucks for two so it's not cheap. Wound up ordering a side of broccoli rabe and there was a miscommunication so came out way after we finished entree. They took it off the bill so that was good. One last thing the bread. It's a seeded Italian bread that comes out piping hot. It looks delicious but it's not at all. It tastes like hot white bread.

Came with high expectations but was disappointed in the overall experience.  The appetizers were good but not outstanding - soft shell crab the exception - it was excellent. The outside dining area is very nice but the service was the real letdown. First, someone should always greet you when arrive - did not happen as you need to find the reception area in the middle of the restaurant off the bar area (bar is very upscale). We were all seated and ordered wine and our meals. This is where it all began to fall apart as the waiters came and gone but never really noticed us - exception the sommelier who was great. They bumped into our seats and food dropped throughout the meal - very annoying. Main courses were just OK, portions  on the smaller side but not outstanding. Desert - bombolini was the highlight.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193869,"What a disappointment! Being a fan of Mario Batali I was expecting the usual excellent service and food on a rare night out. I most recently had a wonderful experience at Tarry Lodge in Port Chester. The restaurant itself is quite large but elegant, if a little cold. Speaking of cold, our server couldn't have seemed more annoyed to have to speak to us. He had absolutely no warmth and his recommendations seemed rehearsed and stiff. We first ordered some very overpriced glasses of wine, the recommendation from the sommelier was on point but the white was served ice cold. I had to let it warm up for about 10 minutes before it was even drinkable. Unfortunately, our appetizers were served about five minutes after we placed the order, before even having sip of wine. The Sweet Corn and Charred Romano Beans was so pedestrian and was quite honestly an odd combination of ingredients. The dish we received looked nothing like the elegant presentation I saw photos of. Aside from not personally loving the menu item itself, the taste did nothing to change my mind. Overly buttered corn with a few beans and charred cheese. It was odd and obviously thrown on the plate with no thought. We also had the Artichokes and Sunchokes which was a huge failure. The artichokes tasted straight from can, dried, sliced and put on a plate with no seasoning, flavor or reason to be there. It was awful. The entrees were unfortunately not any better and also served only a few minutes after our table was cleared. We shared the Squid Ink Pasta, Lobster, Sweet Corn & Jalapeno and Bucatini La Sirena: Spicy Octopus with Estratto. Both of the pastas themselves were very good and obviously handmade. The sauces were also good, but nothing more than that. Unfortunately, both the octopus and lobster was served in such small portions that our dishes were basically plain pasta. They seafood was also overcooked and unseasoned. The lobster was chewy and obviously very overdone and the octopus tasted like it was thrown in a pot with the sauce to boil. We left over almost all of the octopus pieces. It was such a disspointment after having such memorable experiences in his other restaurants.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193548,"I am a huge fan of Mario Batali's cooking style in general, and an even bigger fan of his Spanish tapas haunt Casa Mono. After finally being able to score a res at La Sirena (the Italy v Spain concept is fascinating) to host my cousins that are in town from Paris, I scoured the menu for something to try upon arrival and settled on the ""Asparagus"" tasting menu as did two of the others in my party. The dishes in the tasting menus are an innovative combination of authentic Spanish and Italian ingredients, but they go a bit too far - especially the fritto mixto which, as the main dish of the tasting menu, lacks true depth and is instead reminiscent of the over-battered and over-fried 'delights' one might find at the Seaside Heights boardwalk. I actually had to pick off the fried dough to get to the real ingredients and flavors of the dish, which are Meyer lemon (seriously? Fried lemon? With the rind?), microscopic calamari, and asparagus. Normally I would vow to never return to a place that is seemingly hyped-up and lacking in true culinary value, but I think the mistake was mine and will return to order something more 'traditional' next time. I cannot say enough about the appetizers - the prosciutto v. jamón serrano is a must-try, as is the burrata - and the cocktails. When my mom shared with our waiter that she was disappointed with her dessert, he immediately suggested one that she might like, on the house. The somm is as knowledgeable as the wine list is impeccable, and our waiter (I wish I could remember his name!) was an absolute pleasure, attentive, and truly knows the food. It is really the staff that is bringing me back for a second chance - not sure I will go back if they fail that one, too.Another thing that I found strange - I made my reservation on March 7 for March 18. OpenTable said there was one table available for 6:15, and the next open table was at 9:30. I called La Sirena, and they confirmed. We sat down at about 6:20, and there were no other diners in the main dining room except for my party of 4 and two other tables. When our entrées arrived at about 8, half of the dining room was still empty.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,161991,"First, I will say I'm surprised at the customer service complaints listed here. I joined two friends who were seated at a two top already being served appetizers. The staff greeted me warmly and accommodated me at the table immediately. Bringing chair, water, place setting, and an extra glass for the bottle of wine at the table fairly quickly. Also, they let us know they would accommodate us at a 4 top that was leaving soon. We eventually declined as we were comfortable with the arrangements originally made available to us. My friends had richer dishes like the soft shell crab app and the meatballs.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193370,"I'm surprised that Pete Wells gave La Sirena two stars because the food wasn't good at all. They had introduced the beef tartar on the menu yesterday and it was good, but it had a bit too much spicy mayo. I then had the squid ink pasta and it was presented beautifully, but it didn't taste good. The noodles were black, but there wasn't a sauce with it. It was very dry and the lobster was around the plate, not mixed together so the pasta didn't really get lobster flavor. Finally, it had bread crumbs, which I didn't think would be an issue at first, but then noticed that it sort of hides the fact that the pasta doesn't taste like squid ink at all. For squid ink pasta I would highly recommend going to Upholstery Store, Giovanni Rana (which is right across the street from La Sirena), or even Cacio e Vino in EV. These all have a better squid ink pasta dish than La Sirena.  Very, very disappointing.My boyfriend had the branzino and I thought it tasted better than my regrettable squid ink pasta, but he said it tasted as if they coated the fish with pepper. So this dish was also not a success.The wine was good. The bottles are priced well.The service was really great. We got in a bit early and they told us to wait at the bar. Then the waitress came right at the time of our reservation and walked us to our table. Even though it was packed, the waiters seemed organized and we felt that they took good care of us. At the end of our dinner we both thought that the restaurant was a place where you could come in the afternoon and enjoy a bottle of wine with an appetizer, but that it isn't a place to have an exceptional dinner. Then we saw that there's construction in front of Chelsea Market and right next to it too, so there's not really much of a view either.Sorry, Batali, but this is strike #2.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,53106,"La Sirena has been on my list for a while, but I happened to stop in on a whim for brunch one Saturday. Luckily, they had seating available on their beautiful outdoor patio. One thing I love about the outdoor seating in particular is the fact that the eating area is one floor above street level, so it is less noisy and separated from people walking on the sidewalk. I did see the inside of the restaurant as well, along with the lobby of its adjoined hotel, and the atmosphere was beautiful. I loved the modern minimalism of the dining room and bar, juxtaposed with the dark and cozy look of the hotel lobby. The ambience is quite fantastic. The brunch menu is a little small, but they have a nice range of dishes to choose from for those who like it sweet, as well as for those who like it savory. If you have a sweet tooth, like me, go for their noteworthy ""muffin"", which is hardly a muffin but rather an enormous coffee cake-sort of confection that's the size of my head. It is obviously meant to be shared amongst many people, and features a dulce de leche sauce that is poured by yourself into the warm core of the ""muffin"", which the waiter excavates with his serving spoons. I always love dishes that involve an element of participation on behalf of the diner, and it was certainly cool to pour the warm rich sauce into that crater of sweet cake goodness. It was probably one of the most decadent things I have ever eaten, definitely sweet but the muffin itself was so moist and delicious. I think I put too much of the sauce inside, but with the right amount it is delicious! I would recommend using it as a dipping sauce perhaps, because the muffin is honestly perfect on its own. I've never had anything like it, and it was definitely one of the more memorable brunch meals I've had. For mains, I went for the pancakes with marscapone and amaretti. They were some of the best pancakes I've ever had, so moist yet not overly dense, and the creaminess of the marscapone went well with the crumbles of amaretti on top. I probably should have gone for a savory dish, because I did get a stomach ache later on from all the sweetness, but it was totally worth it. I also got to taste their horchata french toast and breakfast paella, both of which were also excellent. The paella in particular is something I would definitely order next time. As for the service, unlike others who have dined here, it was top notch. Our server was very friendly and warm, as well as very knowledgable on the menu. We didn't wait very long for anything, and I felt the service was professional and up to par with the atmosphere and the food. Overall, this is easily one of my new favorite restaurants in the city.

Our reservation was for 1 PM and we arrived about 1/2 hour early and volunteered to have a seat at the bar while our table was being prepared. It was a very wise choice. Our cocktails were mixed perfectly and professionally by a very congenial bartender. I had a wonderful bloody marry garnished with a ""house made"" pickle twist and Julie had a corpse revive #2. Our table was ready and they moved our drinks and bar bill to the restaurant. Please see my pictures of the menu and our wonderful brunch selections. Total bill with drinks and tip came to $140.00. Five stars all the way including the exceptional service from the hostesses, bartenders and wait staff.

All was very good as enjoyed quail, rabbit and swordfish. I did find swordfish a bit overcooked and the sauce overpowered the fish. Loved the semolina bread. Not many vegetarian options.You better know your Italian wines as have a tablet with many pages worth of choices.  The kerner by the glass was good. The wine list varied from 40 to 240 dollars. Tablet allowed you to like wines as you went so did not have to flip around.Service was good as lost track of how many people served us and sommelier stopped by twice. Had to wait 15 minutes for table but considering very popular as just opened that is okay.  Customers could easily go between 1 to 5 courses so hard to judge when tables will open. Seemed to be easy for parties of 2 to eat in bar area. The couple things I wish they did was since place so huge it gets very loud.  Many other places add design features like putting slated drop ceilings or slightly protruding wall features to dampen the noise.  Also add sambucca to liquors they offer in tablet or dessert menu.Overall great place as went when location was la bottega and can tell spent fortune to open this.  I am sure batali is no where in the kitchen but will return though maybe on weekday when likely less noisy.",5.0 star rating,"Baltimore, MD",2,1,0.20000000298,6.80000019073,"food,half stars,All,swordfish,quail,rabbit,tables,Tablet,swordfish,tablet,wines,track,semolina bread,fish,sauce,options.,table,wines,kerner,pages,choices,glass,wine list,sommelier,around.Service,people,tablet,courses,parties,things,Italian,place,location,Customers,wall,noise,drop ceilings,sambucca,liquors,dessert,batali,bottega,kitchen,place,fortune,bar area,design features,places","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,6,7,3,7,2,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,2,7,2","0.10636511445,0.0761031582952,0.0610351599753,0.0584536455572,0.0512294061482,0.0512294061482,0.040853112936,0.0375187657773,0.0352146700025,0.0279024858028,0.0244304202497,0.0214016288519,0.0202692430466,0.0195869021118,0.0195869021118,0.0194609742612,0.0187318660319,0.0168408825994,0.0156637206674,0.013153010048,0.013153010048,0.0131227169186,0.0130971586332,0.0130750583485,0.0130750583485,0.0130750583485,0.0127491634339,0.011933398433,0.0119190188125,0.0118766203523,0.0115388743579,0.0111573664472,0.0106037436053,0.0102522643283,0.0088900718838,0.0088900718838,0.0088900718838,0.00888173468411,0.00888173468411,0.00888173468411,0.0075270794332,0.00655383057892,0.00614618975669,0.00490792840719,0.00436908751726,0.00390996877104,0.00390169746242,0.0037098119501"

Lots of shaded seating options for those who want to stay out of the sun. Only negative here is you're in the middle of 9th avenue on a perfect day which means: lots of traffic. But for most of us, it quickly becomes white noise. Crispy pork belly ($21) with poached egg, avocado, yellow tomato, saffron, and chimichurri exceeded expectations. Perfect pieces of pork belly perfectly prepared. Many times you will find the outer skin overdone but La Sirena kept the texture even. I wish there were more than 3 pieces of pork belly! The Amaretti Mascarpone Pancakes with maple syrup and butter were very soft and fluffy, definitely better than all the options at Clinton Street. Goat neck chilaquiles ($19) with nixtamal's tortillas, fried egg, and ricotta salata was really excellent. Unlike at Cookshop and other brunch spots, the tortillas was not swimming around in a bowl of sauce. At La Sirena it was prepared almost like a mille-crepe with dozens of layers of tortilla, laced with ricotta. Egg on top was perfect #yolkporn.

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,30279,"I was actually quite surprised by how much I liked it here. I saw the reviews and I was expecting MUCH worse. Yes it is expensive and yes the service is not the BEST buuuuuut it's not as bad as everyone makes it seem but my review is slightly biased BECAUSE 1) i didn't pay for dinner 2) I was with a party that's friends with someone in the kitchen. The four star rating is still legit though and I justify it with ONE thing and that one thing over powers everything else...THE PASTA IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Yes that good. If you go do the bis (pasta share for the table)What we hadCrudo (red snapper this evening) with watermelon radish and something else I don't remember but it was fresh and delicious.Artichoke app was boring bland and just don't order itBuricotta was good but the crushed peas and mint was bleh to me I did not like it with the cheese, maybe with a light fish or something but not with cheese. Bad comboCalamari was amazing. Grilled to perfection still soft and tender barely need to chew it, just sort of falls into your teeth.Quail app was amazing! Even the vinegary rhubarb purée underneath it complimented the quail and ramps perfectly. I love ramps!Bucatini alla arrabiata HOLY MOTHER OF ... Absolutely by far the BEST arrabiata sauce I have ever had anywhere including Italy! The sauce is spicier than most but seems so balanced on your palate by the tomato sauce. Something about the sauce screams perfection! And the bucatini was perfectly chewy with that al dente crunch in the core. This dish is a must if you dine hereCavatelli ,...again... The best cavatelli I have ever had!! The spare ribs remind of this Korean spare rib dish my grandma makes, the seasoning on it was exactly the same. It was perfectly salted and the cavatelli was cooked perfectly as well with that center crunch and chewy outside. This is WHY I give 4 starsBranzino served with radish and something green I couldn't figure out what the slaw completely consisted of but it was amazing!! The green purée thing they poured on the side was meh I could def do without it but the slaw with branzino was the perfect accompaniment. The branzino was prepared just right but we did find quite a bit of bones after they deboned it.Steak was a big disappointment to me, the end pieces my friends state were really good and seasoned well but the way they sliced the cuts of meat had very little surface space and the seasoning was not consistent: random bland bites of mean then random super salty bites. I also got several bites of tendons or something that were so tough I couldn't chew it and had to spit it out. Cheesy potato balls that came with the steak-LITERALLY tastes like a cheez-it, I swear!Cauliflower side was super salty to me but I think it was the cheese or something they put it in.Pineapple dessert was my faveThe grandma something dessert... Tart? Pretty good, loved the pine nuts in it. Not too sweet which I love. Not a huge super sweet fan.I can't remember the other dessert we got but they make a decent espresso, seemed on the weaker side but tasted good.CocktailsGold rush, it's not on the menu. But if you know your cocktails it's a classic. The bartender made a perfect one.There can only be one (I think that's was it was called) is basically a gold rush but made with highland 12 yr and it sounded like a good choice but the smokeyness of the highland does not complement honey and citrus. It's too much of a contradiction in the worst way possibleClassic negroni was good but they're version which is on the menu had this weird sweet beginning with a bad bitter end not a good kind of bitter, again too contradicting.Service: good. Our waiter seemed like he was too busy and not in the best mood. Not mean but not really happy. We did send back two drinks but we weren't nasty about it, we were very nice and one was because he messed up the order. The servers were awesome the bartenders was awesome everyone else was pretty much awesome. Our waiter just seemed like he was over it, not a bad waiter by any means, just not cheerful. Overall: go for the pasta but be prepared to spend $$$$$$$$$$$, it's reaaaaallllllyyyyy expensiveRandom side note the bar stools are THE MOST comfortable seats ever!

La Sirena Ristorante,5335,88 9th Ave,New York,10011.0,193610,"""Situational Awareness"" is what the waitstaff lacks at this beautiful, brightly lit, addition to The Maritime hotel.I arrived on a rainy Sunday morning around 9:50 and the restaurant was fairly empty with about 8 customers and 3 waitstaff. As I sat, I watched the waiters move to and fro and not a single one noticed me rubbernecking for a damn menu until after about 10-15 minutes of being seated. Finally, Sirena C sweetly provided me with a menu and apologies. I had previously viewed the menu before arriving but I still took a quick 2 minute scan in case the online version was missing something. I zeroed in on the amaretti mascarpone pancakes with a side order of egg whites and a cappuccino. Usually, your beverage is brought out immediately, but not here. After about 15 minutes of waiting for my beloved coffee, I asked another waiter if he could check the status, when magically, it appeared. Too bad, right behind it also came my breakfast. I barley had any time to simply enjoy the perfectly whipped cappuccino for fear my food would get cold. The pancakes were fine, nothing to write home about. Basically, they were plain cakes with some mascarpone butter and tons of crumbled amaretti cookies atop. The eggs were great, but for $12 for two egg whites, I could have bought a dozen. Needless to say, after all of that, I still sat and waited forever for my check. Not only had I stopped eating, I sat the napkin down on the table and went to the restroom hoping that when I returned, the check would be there...um, no. Even when I stood up to put on my scarf and coat, did anyone notice me. Ok, I was the only black person eating and I have big, curly hair so I am quite noticeable....still no dice. I had to physically approach the hostess stand to request my check and then Sirena C. brought my check with apologies.

A proper Neapolitan pizza this was not.

Got back on the phone with me and told me that my order has not gone out yet.  So I asked if my pizza is going to come cold since I was originally told that the pizza went into the oven at 5:45.  She said no, it was just coming out of the oven.  Either she was lying or my pizza was going to be burnt.  Either way it all didn't make sense.6:45pm:  Pizza finally arrived and, surprise surprise, it was cold.  It was getting late and I didn't have time to order something else so we put in the microwave.  Oh, and the delivery guy didn't call as I advised to do on my order.6:56pm:  Called Seamless and complained.  Seamless called the restaurant and they told me that someone was going to reach out to me an offer a credit for my next order.  No one has done that as of yet...This is a major disappointment as their fresh mozzarella pizza, when delivered in a timely manner, is terrrific!",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.300000011921,8.69999980927,"pizza,chance,chance,straw,Timeline,opportunity,events,Seamless,Lady,pizza,disappointment,order,restaurant,oven,pizza,Place,pizza,confirmation,order,order,restaurant,oven,oven,delivery guy,Seamless.5,someone,other,person,hold,phone,way,mozzarella pizza,Seamless,restaurant,delivery guy,order,Pizza,offer,credit,manner,No one,surprise surprise,something,microwave","6,7,7,7,7,7,4,3,1,6,4,7,2,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,2,1,1,1,7,6,7,6,7,2,1,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,6","0.107932798564,0.104811504483,0.104811504483,0.046962402761,0.0468733534217,0.0438777431846,0.0437193214893,0.0292514991015,0.0285788066685,0.0263535510749,0.0255543123931,0.0247232411057,0.0210493151098,0.0209900587797,0.0208127908409,0.0191510114819,0.0178148839623,0.0171908196062,0.016977455467,0.016977455467,0.0141513356939,0.0128683745861,0.0128528624773,0.0128483502194,0.0124779939651,0.0122409369797,0.0112434150651,0.0112434150651,0.0112434150651,0.0112077016383,0.0102095231414,0.0101805282757,0.00956845004112,0.00956063251942,0.0087036434561,0.00796161964536,0.00528607796878,0.00526926806197,0.00526926806197,0.00526522053406,0.00494187884033,0.00382589572109,0.0038223026786,0.00334405596368"

Even finding the right Yelp profile was annoying.First off, no one greeted us or said anything when we walked in. We just sat down at our own table. The waiter there was probably one of the rudest people I've met. Even as we sat down, he was still talking on the phone, and then when I asked him to come over, he STILL didn't get off the phone. No one handed us menus, we had to get up and get them ourselves, and they were the takeout menus too.We had to ask for water, and when they gave it to us, it was in a paper pizzeria cup. There were five of us, and we ordered the Veal Milanese with spaghetti side, Chicken Milanese with a ziti side, meatball hero, spicy Buffalo wings, fried Buffalo wings, lasagna, and baked ziti.When the food came, it looked okay. Except for the wings, they looked like they were already soggy. They weren't all that great tasting either. Waste of $20.The Veal Milanese, was the worst tasting thing we ordered. Absolutely horrible, I don't think cow was made to be fried. It was less than a centimeter thick, and absolutely disgusting. I can't even explain the taste, it was just horrible. If I could go back, I'd punch myself for ordering it. Waste of $11.Chicken Milanese, most bland thing ordered by far. All you could taste was the fried part of it, and I could've sworn the chicken was paper thin, and it was only the breaded part that made it thicker. There was no taste to it at all. I remember the description saying it was ""breaded with Italian herbs"". If Italian herbs have no taste, then they sure did a good job making it. Waste of $10.Lasagna, flat and soupy looking. It looked decent at first, and then as it was eaten into, the sauce turned into a soupy consistency. Waste of $10.Baked ziti, absolutely disgusting. It wasn't even baked! It looked like they made the ziti, poured maybe a spoonful of sauce on the sides, and then melted a giant block of cheese in the middle. The cheese, as my boyfriend said, ""could've been used for another meal"". It was ridiculous. Absolute waste of $9.Meatball hero, the only thing that was pleasant to the eyeball. My friend didn't comment on it, so I'm guessing it was the only thing there that was even close to good. $7.The total came out to be $73, I'd rather eat 73 McChickens from McDonald's at once, than to pay $73 again for disgusting food. They should pay ME to eat there again. And yes, from the restaurant picture, this is the pizzeria and not the ""ristorante"".Let's just say the only good thing about this place, is the fact that I didn't see a rat while I was eating.

The square is nice and thin and equivalent to the concept of a nice grandma thin slice. The upside down is exactly that the nice cheese on the bottom and their delicious sauce on top. The franchise any option is delicious the lemon sauce is perfect. All in all the food is absolutely delicious and the owners and managers always do their best to accommodate their customers! I have been a customer for 10+ years and wouldn't go anywhere else! Dining in their brick oven is to die for!! The staff is absolutely amazing and they go above and beyond for their customers.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,28595,"My fiancé and I walked by this place before and I was craving Mexican food and decided to give it a try. The space is very inviting with bright colors and chill dub music playing. The menu was written on the wall which was cool - but when we asked the waitress about a few dishes she couldn't really explain much since she spoke mostly Spanish which was fine but lead to a problem later... I chose to order the tuna Torta but after finding out from the waitress that it is technically an appetizer portion I changed my mind and went with the squid tacos. My fiancé ordered shrimp tacos and we also went with 12 bluepoint oysters. So the language barrier led to the waitress bringing out the tuna Torta and then looking very upset when we said no we ordered the squid tacos instead. It literally took the manager? to come over and tell her no they don't want that. Even after we could hear the conversation in Spanish (which I speak) going on and on about what happened. 1) don't assume people don't understand Spanish. 2) Be understanding and admit you made a mistake.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,193228,"Some friends and I stumbled upon this place on our way to mini golf. It looked like a nice little restaurant and they had a happy hour, so we decided to stop in. It started off as a party of 2, and ended up being a party of 9 but they were able to accommodate since the restaurant was not that busy. We ordered the hibiscus margarita off the happy hour - it was $8 and decent. My only issue was that it took around 20 minutes to get the drink. In between ordering the drink and getting the drink, we placed our order: 1 chicken taco, 1 steak taco, rice & beans, 1 fish taco, and 1 squid taco. It took around 45 minutes for us to get this food. In the meanwhile, we saw tables who arrived after we ordered our food receive both their appetizers and main entrees. When we first told the woman who appeared to be the manager that we have been waiting 30 minutes plus, she said our food was being plated. 5 minutes later, we tried to cancel the order since we were so hungry and would've rather gone somewhere else. Again, she said the food was being plated. It took almost another 15 minutes for us to get the food. ""Slow""teria is right. When the food came out, they mistakenly gave us an extra chicken taco - not to make up for their slow service, but because they were confused. The food was okay - chicken was dry, and the steak taco came with onion even though we had ordered it without onion. My friend who is intolerant to sesame seed noticed there were sesame seeds in the tortilla - it got returned and the manager said they would bring us out a new Taco without the sesame seeds. After a bite he realized this new taco also had sesame seeds. We didn't even bother to bring this up to the restaurant - another friend just ate the taco. The ambiance was nice, and the food was okay. Would probably never return - although I would recommend it to someone to try, I would warn them about the service. I would advise for them to eat at the McDonald's around the block before or after - which is where I am currently sitting writing this review because I left hungry. It was not worth ordering more food. Today was the last official day of summer and it is not how I envisioned my last dinner for the summer.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,14020,"This is one of those places that had been on our list for a while but for some reason couldn't pull the trigger on. Maybe it was the fairly high prices ($6 for a taco) or the lack of any online menu (thankfully other Yelpers saved the day as usual with their images of menu) or the fact that their are finally a lot of really excellent Mexican options in the surrounding area.  The tipping point tonight was having friends from Brussels staying with who were so starved for Mexican in any form said to give it a try as nothing was worse than what they have. The evening started out well with super nice staff, outdoor seating, and $8 happy hour citrus margaritas. The margaritas were delicious and the vibe was right. We started with the guac ($11) which is awkwardly made table side.  I say awkwardly as rather than in a stone bowl they come out with an avocado split into in a square ceramic bowl and a potato masher. These things just don't go together and is probably the worst possible way you could make guac. Half the avocado was still left on the masher when waitress took away and of course there is no way you can get everything evenly mashed in a square bowl. The flavor was nice and the hand made tortillas good but it is not a lot a guac and nothing is added by doing table side. That trend passed years ago and they should just make in kitchen like rest of food and spare the poor servers.  For food we ordered fish tacos, and barbacoa and pork taquitos. The fish tacos come in a larger tortilla and include side of salsa and a cream sauce (and fresh cut onions). The fish has the skin on it and is topped with cactus.  The flavor was good but I made the mistake of trying the barbacoa first which is incredibly flavorful. Once you try that you are ruined and everything else seems bland. Our waiter mentioned bringing out hot sauces but never returned. We then realized other table got test tubes of sauces right from the start. We were nearly done but I ran inside and just grabbed for myself.  The habanero sauce makes a world of difference for the fish and pork taco (the pork was the least flavorful of everything we had).  While the staff was really nice they brought us an extra drink we didn't order (but we just told them not to worry and kept and paid for) and forgot our side of rice and beans which ended up on bill but they took off after we alerted them and then there was not bringing the sauces from start. Nonetheless we liked our meal and experience (we would just get the barbacoa and happy hour margaritas next time).

The shrimp taco was juicy and flavorful, but tasted much better with some added sauces they provide on the side.

So I got the bacon and jalapeño-wrapped shrimp huevos rancheros. She described it as ""medium spicy [for a real man]"" which had me crying/snotting by the end of the meal. It was quite delicious, despite barely being able to see the plate through my own tears. My wife's spicy tuna tostada was also very tasty, with the Asian/Mexican flavor mashup being as well-matched as you can really ask.It seems as though all of the flavors at La Slowteria are on point. Whoever is back there in the kitchen has a unique and wonderful vision when it comes to food. I do think a little refinement and balance might be necessary, if only to make things easier to eat. There was a lot of sinew running through the tuna itself, and the huge rings of onion were difficult to deal with. The portion sizes were also a little inconsistent; there was a mountain of tuna, and only two shrimp. Overall though, this is a place I can't wait to get back to. The service is friendly and hospitable, the backyard is picturesque, and the flavors are huge.

We've got plenty of banks, nail salons and real estate brokers, but nothing that was excellent.If you venture further down Court Street - almost where you hit the BQE- you'll find a smallish little treat called La Slowteria. I'm not certain it's the best name to attract customers, but I've been there where it clearly takes time for their culinary expertise. In the winter they make good use of the small space inside and are even accommodating for strollers! In the summer they have a newly renovated backyard that is a little oasis. Don't miss out on their happy hour margaritas that are all individually made- sometimes even special flavors (try cucumber). Drink up and order La Luna as an appetizer or for the kids - it's a cheese medley or a remodified quesadilla. Also they have a secret kids menu with slightly smaller portions but the very same care and flavor. The guacamole is small, but satisfyingly made table side. (Ask  for more tortillas in advance)!For the main meals you will be ecstatic with any combo of the tacos.

So I've visited this restaurant a couple of times it's not a bad place, they do need to have more menu options. I was really stuck on their cucumber margarita. It is delicious I love that they juice the cucumber in a juicer. Anyway to the point of why are getting one star last night I went around 7 sat at the bar all the tables were reserved we only came in for drinks anyway. We made it for happy hour with only 30 mins left. We got guacamole as well. The bill came we paid. We tipped them well, so today I check my account and notice that slowteria took out more money then I signed for. I guess they added more money to their tip. It was a 89 dollar bill and I gave them a 15 dollar tip. It was at the bar no special service was given just my order was taken and that's it but I loved the cucumber margs. They added 23 dollars more on top of the 15 dollar tip!! Maybe it was a mistake but I couldn't believe it. I guess pay cash if you want to go here.First Time this has ever happened to me at a restaurant from my many visits to New York. I didn't want to deal with the hassle of having to contact management since I was traveling that next day, plus from the one email that I exchanged with Stephanie she made her own conclusions I never received a free meal I was honest and my card company gave me the difference back and had to issue a new card. Stephanie didn't even give me a chance to tell her what date so she doesn't have any real information about the incident. She immediately went on the defensive I understand it's her business, but she didn't even give me a chance to reply to her again since she wrote me late at night.

I am going to divide this up so you can truly understand the restaurant and experience. 1) Outdoor space - 5 stars - The outdoor space is beautiful, large and perfect for Summer. When we arrived at 7:30 there were two families, a birthday party and a few happy hour friends and the atmosphere was perfect for a Summer evening. 2) Happy Hour - 5 stars- We just missed happy hour but everyone says they have a great happy hour special 3) Cocktails - The margarita my husband had was perfect and the virgin mojito they made for this pregnant lady was delicious. My husband's only gripe was their limited beer menu especially in the way of Mexican beers (no Negro Modelo or Corona?).4) Food - The food was a bit hit or miss. The bean appetizer and salsa sampler were both delicious and five stars. Their chips are unlike any we've had before as they are homemade, thicker tortilla chips/strips and SO delicious. The shrimp tacos were also DELICIOUS and quite large. It's sort of annoying that cheese and avocado are extra, but oh well. The taquitos were so disappointing that neither of us finished ours. Also, if you get the bean appetizer it is so large and filling that you'll find you can't eat most of your entree. Their side of rice and beans was underwhelming which is surprising since the bean appetizer had SO much flavor. When we go back we'd order the bean appetizer, salsa sampler, and shrimp tacos - end of story. 5) Service - This is where the restaurant gets probably a 1. The servers did not know ANYTHING about the menu in fact when we asked two separate people the asked to hold our menu and then just read the dish back to us from the menu. I think they must have been stoned out of their minds as they also served all the dishes to the wrong tables throughout the evening. In fact, it became so hilarious to watch that it doubled as our dinner entertainment though it was also very annoying.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,11.6000003815,"stars,stars,experience,space,stars,bit hit,La Sloweteria,people,restaurant,experience,beer menu,Service,atmosphere,bean appetizer,friends,birthday party,everyone,stars,menu,husband,Cocktails,mojito,husband,beers,Food,salsa sampler,tortilla chips,side,chips,dish,Summer,margarita,lady,way,strips,menu,avocado,cheese,restaurant,fact,story,ANYTHING,families,menu,Corona,Mexican,Negro,bean appetizer,dishes,neither,fact,minds,tables,dinner entertainment,shrimp tacos,bean appetizer,beans,servers,bean appetizer,taquitos,shrimp tacos,salsa sampler,entree,most,flavor,rice","7,1,7,2,1,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.270502477884,0.0967627689242,0.0624143183231,0.0363742485642,0.0351523086429,0.0326761193573,0.0325665473938,0.0314346849918,0.0298953354359,0.0298953354359,0.028615642339,0.0160698350519,0.0118602756411,0.0105470931157,0.00993493199348,0.00993493199348,0.00965929217637,0.00900823250413,0.00869158003479,0.00814620684832,0.00798868667334,0.00798868667334,0.00762879895046,0.00762879895046,0.00762879895046,0.007613921538,0.00760105717927,0.00739012472332,0.00713466620073,0.00698329601437,0.00675052264705,0.00669072894379,0.00669072894379,0.00667529506609,0.00624282099307,0.00609669880942,0.00606945250183,0.00569689739496,0.00515664368868,0.00515242805704,0.00451570702717,0.00450807111338,0.00430625397712,0.00422179792076,0.00395284313709,0.00395284313709,0.00395284313709,0.00390403880738,0.00375032937154,0.00374525645748,0.00356231979094,0.00311891618185,0.00311891618185,0.00311665679328,0.00300929904915,0.00285735609941,0.0028479648754,0.00283969077282,0.00267930747941,0.00262608309276,0.00226401421241,0.00226401421241,0.00198456668295,0.00198456668295,0.00198255316354,0.00198255316354"

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,3115,"I rarely write bad reviews and hate to do it, but we had such a disastrous experience that I feel I have no choice. Also, Let me preface this by saying it has taken me forever to write this review, so hopefully things have changed since our experience...OK so we went out for a date night, which with a baby at home rarely ever happens, and we were hoping for a nice and relaxing night. Well it absolutely did not turn out that way. We had an 8p reservation on a Friday night. When we arrived at the restaurant - about 10 minutes early - we were told that our table would be ready in about 30 minutes. Ok it happens, so we decided to go down the block for a drink. On our second drink they called from the restaurant to say our table was ready. I told them we just had to close out the bill and would be right over. The lady on the phone said no problem so we chugged our drink and exactly 6 minutes later we arrived back at La Slowteria. Once we arrived the hostess told us that she had just given up our table!! Wait what?! I showed her the time stamp on our phone call and she saw that it had only been 6 minutes since we spoke. She apologized and said another couple was paying their tab now and that another table would be available shortly. So we waited and finally were seated at close to 9pm. As she sat us, the hostess offered me a drink, and even though I wasn't planning on drinking (still breastfeeding) I decided I didn't want to pass on the offer and went with the cucumber margarita. It was delicious and made me a feel just a bit better about the table screw up. Now onto the food - we ordered the guacamole which was tasty but was not prepared at the table as other reviewers explained. I don't remember the shrimp appetizer that we ordered, but it included bacon which was NOT indicated on the menu. We do not eat pork and had to spit it out. I called over the server and she apologized profusely and said they would make sure to correct it on the menu. After that we ordered a few tacos which were good, but not worth the headache of everything else. Service was slow and not attentive. To top everything off, the margarita that the hostess offered me and the bacon shrimp dish we returned were BOTH on our bill! We were charged for both!! I couldn't believe it and didn't even have the energy to argue about it. I hate having a bad date night because it's so rare that we get a night out, but this was one of the worst we've had.",1.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.300000011921,11.8999996185,"table,experience,reviews,choice,review,hostess,hostess,experience,things,baby,table,bacon,restaurant,table,home,8p reservation,hostess,drink,drink,drink,drink,drinking,energy,restaurant,phone,cucumber margarita,block,problem,phone call,couple,tab,lady,Service,offer,guacamole,margarita,bill,way,server,menu,everything,everything,tacos,time stamp,shrimp appetizer,headache,La Slowteria,bill,both,one,bacon shrimp dish,worst,menu,feel,food,pork,reviewers","7,7,5,7,5,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.190968394279,0.156886652112,0.101373545825,0.0549443513155,0.0486614182591,0.0347303003073,0.0332713872194,0.029976952821,0.0269144047052,0.0262435469776,0.0122450096533,0.0120071331039,0.0113387545571,0.0101217646152,0.0100377062336,0.00994998589158,0.00973469298333,0.00959830079228,0.00957958120853,0.00954913999885,0.00868260860443,0.00868260860443,0.00791876576841,0.0076243840158,0.00760014634579,0.00691022770479,0.00668408675119,0.00664983224124,0.0066256346181,0.00661891745403,0.00661891745403,0.00616295496002,0.00613554473966,0.00604607444257,0.00602161651477,0.00566907087341,0.0056154881604,0.00523328501731,0.00514416629449,0.00514416629449,0.00514098582789,0.00513506121933,0.00496569694951,0.00495025422424,0.00481623597443,0.00449788244441,0.00393710331991,0.00355527037755,0.0035533523187,0.00330885360017,0.00311040435918,0.00310557242483,0.00225917669013,0.00197937921621,0.00197785766795,0.00197506928816,0.00181031750981"

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,686,"This review is going to have many caveats. Firstly, I went with a group to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, so of course, it was going to be busy. Secondly, both owners were out of town and one of their dads (who admittedly had no real restaurant management experience) was running the place that night. So right off the bat, my review isn't going to be the typical experience. But Pete Wells I'm not, so on goes this review.We had an 8:30 reservation, but we ended up getting seated maybe an hour later. We only found out at the end of the night from one of the waitresses that another group actually stole our reserved table inside. We waited patiently at the bar inside, sipping on margaritas (the jalapeno one is good, but for some reason the third one I had tasted weird. I think they switched up the tequila they were using). It's not a good waiting area, as food runners and people going to the bathroom/yard walk past you and the place is pretty narrow.Anyway, we finally got seated at 9:30 in the backyard (insert your Slow-teria jokes here). For the record, the backyard is amazing. There was a table of drunk girls next to us who were complaining loudly that they had waited two hours for food and were getting belligerent. Understandable to be pissed, but also... how about not being complete terrible human beings? They eventually left after their food finally came and they made up some excuses about it not being good.That said, the food is actually delicious. They make the guacamole at your table, and ask you how chunky or spicy you want it. The seafood ceviche is also great; with shrimp, octopus and big chunks of avocado. We also had the Soldado (beans, chorizo and cheese with spicy roasted Serrano peppers). Very cheesy and great for dipping.For my main, I split the taco sampler. It was 6 tacos for $22, which is a great deal. They're smaller than the ones you can just get as a taco platter, but it's a good way to try things out. Ours came with steak, duck, bacon wrapped scallops, chorizo, fish and veggie. The veggie is skippable. My favorites were the steak and the chorizo.At the end of the meal (which was close to 11pm), they gave us a free dessert plate that the acting manager had promised us earlier in the night while we were waiting an hour for our table.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,10025,"My husband brought me here for brunch. He had been here with a friend previously and he instantly knew that I would be a fan. And he was right.  When we walked in it was refreshing to see a modern take on a Mexican restaurant. There was a beautiful collection Joaquin Trujillo's photographs on the wall. I definitely enjoyed the food cart in front of the ferris wheel. And I can never resist an altar for the day of the dead. It was covered in flowers and skulls. The restaurant is painted white and there are wooden chairs, bar and tables.  It added this almost ""by the sea"" feel. I especially enjoyed their three layer, wire, sculptural fruit holder that sat on the bar. We sat down and my husband suggested the cucumber, mezcal margarita. It was smooth with a little spice and the cucumber was bright. When it comes to brunch I am always drawn to either Huevos Rancheros or Chilaquiles. And lucky for me they have Huevos Rancheros. As we waited for our food we split ""La Rana"", which was homemade guac and tostadas. The tostadas were more like vey soft, tasty, blue corn tortillas. Delicious! Then my husband tried the grasshoppers with apple slices. I guess this adventurous app is off the menu. He had previously made friends wih the chef.When the entree arrived it was just what I wanted. And then there was even a nice side dish of rice and beans. There was also a robust cheese that was melted on top of the eggs and tortillas. The cheese separates this restaurant because it represents their passion in details and quality. I highly recommend this restaurant and wish this chef all the success he deserves.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,51192,"I've been here around 10 times; it's one of my neighborhood go-to restaurants. La Slowteria has some of the best Mexican I've ever eaten. The tortillas are homemade and amazing, I love the ceviche and the taco platter. Their brunch is incredible. And those margaritas...yesssss! I like the margarita with mezcal; sometimes I have them change up the jalapeno margarita and throw some mezcal into it. They have a happy hour (I think on weekdays?) but beware because not all margaritas are on special during that time so be sure to clarify before ordering or you'll run up a $50 tab for drinks like I did.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,21708,"I'm truthfully not understanding what all the hype is about. I do however admire the amount of care that has gone into opening a restaurant that serves homemade type Mexican meals. I must say though as I've been dining out for decades that there is something very important missing from this picture.It boils down to taste and sophistication when we are looking at meals that are carefully planned and priced as the entrees are in the $23-24 range. For starters I did not at all enjoy the tasteless flour tacos that are overly, overly thick. I ordered fish tacos to start and was unpleasantly surprised by the bulk of the tasteless taco.  The sauce accompaniments were tasty, yet not enough to take away from the bulky unflavorful taco. Fish tacos made with a bland white fish need more to make your mouth and stomach smile.Next, on to the entree, which was tilapia with pumpkin seed sauce and a veggie-filled empanada. Again the fish, a bland fish with a bland sauce. The empanada arrived as a big brown, almost black burnt one with bland green zucchini inside. I know I should have returned this, but I didn't. I didn't eat the empanada encasing the zucchini because it was burnt, but wouldn't have anyway as it was way, way too thick for my liking.Maybe it's just me, or maybe it was just an off night...but this was a birthday celebration for me and so truthfully...NOT SO MUCH!One more thing.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,56481,"Firstly, I want to say that I love food! I love shopping for it, cooking it, eating it, and even cleaning up when it's all over. When my wife and I eat at La Slowteria, I get the feeling that they feel the same way about food as I do. Hugo and Stephanie are lovely, warm, welcoming and make us feel like a part of their family. The staff are friendly, relaxed, charming and we never feel ""waited on"", just taken care of. Honestly, dinner there feels like we just stopped by our best friends' house for a visit, and accidently showed up in the middle of an amazing three course dinner.It's difficult for me to describe the food at La Slowteria, because I have nothing to compare it to. It is definitely NOT like any Mexican food that I have eaten before. Hugo makes interesting, fresh, dishes which contain strange and delicious combinations of flavors and spices that just make us crazy!!! His Habanero sauce is addictive, and his home made, corn tortillas alone are worth the trip to lower Court St.Last night, my wife and I were treated to the nightly special, a green tomato based soup with beans, bacon, beef, fresh cilantro, onions and a lime wedge to squeeze into the bowl. It's the kind of thing that I could go back for day after day! Warm and satisfying comfort food that never feels heavy or over done. We tried to go there twice with our small daughters, but decided that this place was best kept to ourselves. We now use La Slowteria as the perfect excuse to splurge on a babysitter. We are real home bodies, but La Slowteria gets our tired, old butts out of the house, and into a little beach side restaurant on the coast of Mexico, where we can relax and indulge, get away from the pressures of city life, and enjoy good food, cooked with thoughtfulness and passion, that makes us talk about our next visit, even as we are walking out the door.

I saw a few Bloody Marys come through and they were massive So I have some regrets about not ordering one :( We sat at the bar and were given some tostadas out of nowhere, just out of the kindness of the staff's hearts. They were great, but what really made them was the hot sauce! There was a mildly spicy one and then a habanero based *spicy* sauce. Had a great spice to it and it was served in tall test tubes with an eye dropper so you can control the amount you want on your food with scientific precision. I also got the huevos rancheros served beautifully on a black bean tortilla. One thing I really appreciated was the side of beans/rice.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,193272,"Well, the name doesn't lie: This was the slowest, most disappointing restaurant experience I've had in my 5 years in NYC.After being seated at 7:30 on a relatively non-busy Friday night, we waited 10 minutes to be given menus and order drinks. Another 10 minutes go by, my boyfriend gets his drink, and we order our food. I inquire about my drink (diet coke) and am told that they don't have it. Would have been nice to know when I first ordered it, but oh well. We order some guac and tacos.At this point, a party of 6 gets seated next to us. It's now past 8 and there's guac on their table. We try to signal a waiter to see where ours is, but can't get anyone's attention. Another 10 minutes go by, and we finally flag down someone who's not our waiter. We say that we've been waiting nearly 30 mins for guac, and she goes and grabs one at the counter and brings it over.Well, the worst is over, I think. But now it's 8:30, an hour since we've arrived and 45 minutes since we've ordered, and no tacos. A manager and a waitress that's not ours come by every now and then to check on us, and I simply say we're fine, just waiting on our food (aka, please go check on it).Meanwhile, for the last hour there's been a party of 3 seated next to us that was done eating when we walked in, and has still been waiting on their check. I hear them grumbling about  management. There's a party of 4 with a reservation standing at the door for 15 minutes, and I hear them grumbling as well about the service.Finally, at 9pm, our waitress comes up. 'Well, I've got some bad news and don't worry,' she says. 'But I lost your order ticket. Can you remind me, was I your waitress?' I look back at her, dumbstruck. There are maybe 5 or 6 other parties in the entire restaurant. 'Yup, you were,' my boyfriend takes over. 'Okay, what did you order?' We repeated our order. A minute later, she's back .. 'And did you want cheese on those tacos?'Okay, it's been over an hour since we ordered, she forgot to put in both the appetizers and main course, but now it's going to be fixed. Right? Right??By now, I'm near tears. (This is on me, I was just really hungry and thought Mexican was a good idea if I wanted some quick food.) I turn around to stare at 9th street, and all of the other places we've gone. And then, I start laughing. I get my boyfriend to turn around, and point at the name of the restaurant (which we chose after a quick look at Yelp reviews, and had forgotten): The Slowteria. Well, at least they didn't lie.At this point, I think they decided we were a lost cause no tip situation, because STILL nothing happened. Another 15 minutes go by, we manage to flag down a different waitress. She goes and has a talk with the chef, tells us she'll now take over as our waitress, and at 9:45, we have our dinner.And after all of that, I'd say the tacos were pretty meh.I hate leaving negative reviews on Yelp (this is the first one I've left in 3 years). But as someone who has serious hanger issues, I figured it was my duty to warn you: the name says it all.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,28747,"Came here on a Saturday around 1pm and they were not busy at all; could be a bad thing or a good but for us it was good. We were in a rush. We were quickly greeted by a waitress with menus and she was very pleasant. They offer their entire menu during brunch time which is a plus. They only have two items under their brunch section. We ordered a margarita to share and for appetizer we shared the seafood ceviche. The drink was well made but not my style (it seemed to be on the lighter side) and the ceviche was huge for the price ($15), enough to share for two. It came with a side of fried tortilla (whole pieces, not cut up). We had to order another order of tortilla to finish the ceviche. The ceviche is definitely a 5/5 dish, highly recommended. For entree we had the eggs ranchero with steak and taco platter (1 duck and 1 fish of the day). Everything on the ranchero dish was good except for the STEAK! I got 3 pieces, I REALLY MEAN 3 PIECES OF STEAK (OVERLY COOKED) FOR $8! (Please see my pic for proof) I was livid but chose to internalize it and let it out now. I don't know if they dropped a piece or two on its way out but I have never felt more robbed then I did when I received that dish. So sad. Again, everything else was good on that plate except for the steak. Like cmon? For the taco platter, the duck was very good, juicy and just the right amount of fat. However, the fish (flounder) was not that great. I guess flounder fillets should be batter and deep fried because without it, it just seemed bland. The platter came with a side of rice and beans. After finishing our entrees, we decided to share their chocolate flan dessert. Tasted pretty good but portion was very small. To sum up my story: 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees and a dessert $102 + tax and tip.

It was unbelievable. The presentation, beautiful, and the flavors, incredible. We also got the saldado, a bean, chorizo and cheese dip served with handmade tortilla strips. A-maz-ing.I got the taco taster, which included mini tortillas with one of every taco. The duck was phenomenal, the fish excellent, and the steak delicious. Those were just my favorites! My dad got the duck tacos, which were overstuffed and came with rice and beans. My mom got the ""la rosa""--raw tuna marinated in a soy-sesame marinade with some Mexican flavors, and served on a toastada.

It was like they reheated food made previously and warmed it up in the microwave. I was soooooooo disappointed because I had absolutely loved our meal before. Mind you that we got the exact same order. Another thing I don't like is how they upsell. They ask if you want cheese added to your tacos, but then when you get the bill you are charged extra. They do not tell you this beforehand. I asked for salsa and chips and they brought out the giant sampler tray that's quite expensive.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,385,"Been Meaning to try this place since I saw it on the Toni On show about a year ago so with my coworker in tow I finally made it here on Friday night and I wish I came in sooner. This was one of the best meals Ive had this year. We started with the happy hour special Cucumber Margarita which was great. Perfect balance and very light. For an app we split an order of the table made Guacamole with crispy tostadas and soft charred tortillas. Again the balance of flavors was perfect and if you needed more heat they put their house made hot sauces on the table in cool eyedroppers. The ground habanero was very hot but also quite flavorful and the chipotle was nice and smoky.  For a main I got the two tacos choosing fish and shrimp and both were exceptional with wonderful smoky,spicy flavor on the seafood. They were on soft,warm blue corn tortillas with radishes and other garnishes. Served on a cute tray with a crock of very nice rice and beans with a slice of avocado and sprinkled with cheese,a small bowl of salsa,red onions,cilantro, chili powder dusted lime slice andMexican Crema.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,118408,"This place has great intentions! As for the execution, though, I am on the fence. The heart of the business is providing authentic, good Mexican fare in a slow food style. In practice, I will zero in on the deconstructed mole dish as an example of where it can go wrong. The dish centers around some duck mole (the sauce is thick and a bit gloopy), a dish of rice and pickled onions (?), a side of grilled onion and tomato (?), and the deconstruction of the mole sauce on the plate. Now, I've done my share of molecular gastronomy dining and am no stranger to ""deconstructed"" food. But when you put some dried chiles and a hunk of Mexican chocolate on the plate, it's different from other deconstructed dishes (lame example: a deconstructed breakfast sandwich of eggs and bacon and bread all separated out) because...you can't really eat all the components and have them be satisfying in and of themselves, nor can you combine them if you wanted to experiment with ""reconstruction."" And why two types of onion? And rice? There were, admittedly, delicious tortillas that came with, but they arrived when we were halfway done picking at the plate. And that's what you're forced to do with this presentation: pick. A nibble of chocolate here. Tucking the chile into a tortilla. Ignoring the pickled onion because there's already another onion and there's onion in the sauce. Slow food, to me, is simple and really invites the diner to linger and enjoy something balanced and harmonious. This dish left me scratching my head and a bit unsatisfied.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,46515,"Update: Since I posted this review earlier today, the owner contacted me, which I very much appreciated. Like I said below, the staff are very friendly and they want to give you a great experience in their restaurant. To be fair, my coffee/price issues aside, I would try this place again, maybe for dinner since I already had brunch there and it seems dinner has received good reviews. The food was good and the environment was very warm and friendly. I really hope they succeed, since it's clear they value their customers. (Why am I even on Yelp at 11:40pm on a Friday night? Because I can't sleep knowing that I gave a bad review to people who are genuinely nice and deserve better than my pre-lunch hunger-fueled negative review. Oh, and a lifetime of Catholic-infused guilt.)Like so many earnest new restaurants, they try. They really try. And like my husband who tries to make the bed or put away the dishes..... it's a sweet gesture, but oh, look at you! You have thumbs and you're trying to use them. Like people! As my mom would say, god love 'em.Anyway, I came here for brunch a few weeks with a group of 6. I wanted to see if the new occupiers of the old Dubuque space would do them any justice. Nope. Food was good, not great. I would go back there again IF they didn't supremely annoy me with the fact that there are neither prices nor basic descriptions on the brunch menu. And THEY CHARGE FOR COFFEE BY THE CUP and nowhere on the menu do they indicate that. In fact, my friend asked the waitress (who I think might also have been the owner perhaps) ""Is this fancy coffee?"". Any person with a niblet-sized amount of social skills would interpret this is as ""Did you have to use an espresso machine or anything other than a regular drip machine to make this coffee and therefore it would be charged per cup?"". She said no, it was regular coffee. And when other wait staff came around to ask if we wanted more coffee, they never said, Oh by the way, that's going to be $2.50 for another cup of coffee. Between the 6 of us, we had about 12 or 13 cups of coffee. When we got the bill we were dumbfounded. And for some weird reason, we had three of those coffees comped. Maybe because they realized how stupid it is to charge by the cup and not tell their patrons? But not quite stupid enough to comp all but the first six cups? At that point I didn't really care that my huevos rancheros was actually pretty decent, a lot better than most places that end up making dog breakfasts out of it.I don't want to give this place two stars.

This is not your average mexican-joint. There are plenty of great places to get mexican food in New York City, but this place is a special mexican spot. The food is as creative as it is delicious. The guacamole is great and they make their own chips. And oh, the sauces. This place knows its sauces. They make their own which they give to you in a novel little vile.

I read an article (I think it was in Lucky Peach) recently about how ethnic food (not from Europe) often is expected to be less expensive. Coming from San Francisco, I can attest -- we like our street tacos substantial, and around $3 per. This place is a perfect example of how that is a totally unfair expectation. The food is excellent -- quality ingredients, hearty, beautiful presentation and the seasoning is delicious. Yes, two tacos with rice and beans for $16 may, at first, seem a little bit pricey but in reality, it is completely justified. Between, as I mentioned, the presentation, fresh, LOCALLY SOURCED ingredients & meats, full-meter (I could barely finish my rice and beans) $16 for all of that was kind of a steal.Also, they have a pretty cool happy hour -- free refills on grapefruit margaritas and Modelo!definitely going back.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",1,0,0.40000000596,4.40000009537,"article,place,food,expectation,example,presentation,Lucky Peach,food,ingredients,street tacos,presentation,tacos,rice,beans,seasoning,reality,Europe,San Francisco,rice,beans,all,steal.,refills,grapefruit margaritas,ingredients,meats","5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.224761337042,0.164100512862,0.088644772768,0.0866096615791,0.0859309360385,0.0683281123638,0.0344961956143,0.0208586752415,0.0208586752415,0.017597310245,0.0170487649739,0.0163778811693,0.015571732074,0.015571732074,0.0149251958355,0.0136312628165,0.0132490387186,0.0131813595071,0.0116235343739,0.0116235343739,0.0101733226329,0.0101733226329,0.00704893376678,0.00704893376678,0.00609713140875,0.00446813367307"

However, in the spirit of full disclosure, my experience at this restaurant is NOT reflective of how they ordinarily operate and you should not take it as such. There.So, Cinco de Mayo (aka, the busiest day of the year for Mexican restaurants all across America).  We came with our group of 6 for an 8:30 reservation. We were seated an hour later. Oof, that's rough. There's no good place to stand, so we were relegated to the side of the bar, while being elbowed by passing servers and people using the bathroom. Luckily, a couple rounds of margaritas kept us in good humor. Cucumber was my favorite.So it turned out that our wait was due to the restaurant owners being out of town and having their family member managing the restaurant that evening. Plus, someone stole our table. Like I said, an atypical situation.Once we finally got seated outside in the very cool backyard, we were treated to the whining and moaning of the table of girls across from us, who had apparently been waiting two hours for their food and felt the entire backyard should know this. Not to say that this wasn't true, but it did absolutely nothing to help the situation (theirs or ours). So we were pretty glad when they left, presumably attempting to do a dine and dash (I hope someone caught them). As for us, we had sort of committed ourselves to being here for the rest of the evening, and decided to make the best of it. We ordered guacamole, seafood ceviche, a bean and cheese dip that was similar to nachos (but better), and I split a taco platter for my main, which had smaller versions of almost every single taco on their menu. I have to give them credit where it's due, the food was delicious. I enjoyed everything. The standouts were the ceviche, the dip, and the veggie and chorizo tacos. We were also treated to free dessert for our prolonged wait, which was nice. The servers were very sweet and everyone was extremely apologetic for the long wait, which I appreciated. I think it's worth coming back sometime, but probably not right away, as we didn't finish that dinner until nearly midnight.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,11.5,"something,name,place,experience,service,restaurant,jokes,restaurant,girls,spirit,disclosure,Cucumber,restaurants,restaurant owners,wait,versions,wait,restaurant,wait,group,reservation,servers,place,someone,credit,table,backyard,situation.,dine,food,cheese dip,bathroom,side,bar,people,humor,margaritas,family member,town,whining,moaning,situation,table,food,nothing,dash,rounds,There.So,Cinco de Mayo,Mexican,America,taco,tacos,ceviche,dip,everything,taco platter,menu,chorizo,veggie,everyone,favorite.So,backyard,dessert,dinner,rest,someone,seafood ceviche,guacamole,nachos,bean,standouts,servers,best","7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,4,7,2,1,7,7,7,2,7,3,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,4,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7","0.257833510637,0.105191759765,0.0950597077608,0.068607583642,0.0527882687747,0.0518428906798,0.034498270601,0.0248479768634,0.0170190297067,0.0164831988513,0.0164831988513,0.0126922680065,0.00947384722531,0.00937074702233,0.00748812640086,0.00722872605547,0.00676257396117,0.00631113955751,0.00626734085381,0.00625062687322,0.00625062687322,0.00590158486739,0.0055760955438,0.00524208508432,0.00513128982857,0.00476245488971,0.00476245488971,0.00476245488971,0.00471986178309,0.00435828324407,0.00433049583808,0.00424438016489,0.00419093994424,0.00419093994424,0.00419093994424,0.00418385490775,0.00418385490775,0.00417761551216,0.00417761551216,0.00416700681672,0.00416700681672,0.00408622715622,0.00399318570271,0.0038701351732,0.00380910024978,0.00380523852073,0.00378050934523,0.00371545483358,0.00371545483358,0.00371545483358,0.00371545483358,0.00356611376628,0.00355788320303,0.00323608820327,0.00323608820327,0.00319764530286,0.0028378481511,0.0028378481511,0.00283129676245,0.00283129676245,0.00267215655185,0.00263534858823,0.00240214704536,0.00195886567235,0.00195638113655,0.00188281224109,0.00156704185065,0.00142263795715,0.00124458863866,0.00124458863866,0.00124458863866,0.00122606381774,0.00106526643503,0.000966567196883"

At all hours, La Slowteria is one-of-a-kind, and each time I've gone I've received not only the warmest welcome but some of the best, cared-for food I've ever eaten. Chef Hugo is warm and personable, and he comes out of the kitchen to ask his guests how they're doing, how they like the food and his vibe is one of the warmest I've ever encountered in NYC. Ordinarily, a warm-hearted pleasant chef is only part of the equation, and were it not for each dish's carefully curated charm and flair, this restaurant might come up wanting. And yet, it doesn't. La Slowteria exceeds its own charm with great dishes night after night.  An example: tonight I went in and ordered steak & bacon tacos. I received 2 of the largest tacos I've ever seen. Before that arrived, Hugo sent me an appetizer. I've been here a lot, and yet I'm always surprised. Hugo is a true scientist when it comes to food, and you can see his impassioned flair in each dish. He often surprises guests with mezcal-soaked cherries as a digestif which are a total delight. The staff is witty and quick with a helpful recommendation.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,4134,"I'm happy to have a new mexican restaurant in this neighborhood that hasn't really ever had a decent sit-down mexican spot. The chef is from Tulum, a little town that my wife and I have a sweet spot for (my little photo icon thing is from a trip to Tulum). He seems like a lovely fellow and their staff are all nice and friendly. That said, I totally want to love this place and heck, I gave it four stars, because I sincerely hope that things gel a bit better. A few quirks.- The drunken duck sandwich.This is a sandwich in a soup bowl. The duck was great, but the size of the bread for the sandwich part was super big. And because it was in a pool of broth, it was super soggy. Maybe I'm missing something here. It seemed like a waste of a nice piece of bread.- The deconstructed mole & duckI'm not sure I get this either. The whole awesomeness of any sauce is all the time it spends marrying the flavors together and making that whole magic. Breaking it in to the parts and then forcing the diner to somehow try to very unsuccessfully recreate the sauce... I don't get it. Duck with a mole sauce should have been a home run.- The shrimp & steak skewers dishInteresting presentation, but since this was all done on the skewers, everything is basically blackened - so, visually, not much happening here.

I came here last night for dinner and ordered the spicy hibiscus margarita ($11) and the steak taco ($18). My dining companions had the steak taco, as well, and the taco sampler ($22). We shared the table side guacamole ($10).The idea is that you receive one enormous taco on a house-made corn tortilla. The steak was undercooked, greasy, and flavorless, and the portion I received was noticeably smaller than my friend's. At first I tried to deal, but the few pieces of steak I had were all fat and little meat. I actually spit a piece out. I finally felt like I needed to mention it to the waitress, who removed the plate to have it cooked a little more and said she'd ask the chef to add a few slices of beef. The best thing to do when things are wrong is to let the kitchen know and give them a chance to fix it--right?However, after a few minutes, I received a refreshed plate, but was stunned to find the chef had burnt my few pieces of steak to a crisp (I just asked for medium!!) and had added a pile of fatty trimmings instead of any additional slices of beef. It was very noticeable and felt offensive. What a shameful, disgusting way to treat a paying guest. Who does that??? The taco sampler is massive, but when my companion ordered vegetarian they brought him things he didn't ask for (squid) and didn't want to eat. Additionally, the beans were seawater salty and the rice was old, dry, and unseasoned. The spicy hibiscus margarita was excellent, slightly sweet and spicy, with a warm smokey under-taste from the mescal. The table side guac was pretty tasty, as well, but felt expensive to watch one avocado and some pica de gallo smushed in front of you. You have to order this because you're not getting any chips and salsa at the table (I know, not ""high end,"" but I still miss).

Luckily there were open seats at the bar so we sat at the bar instead. Fortunately Hugo was the bartender and he was AMAZING.

La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,30663,"On one my long walks thru Brooklyn, I finally noticed La Slowteria. And since a friend of mine and I are on the search for the best fish tacos, I knew we had to try. We went a few weeks ago. The place is cute. Bright and festive, but not too much so. The staff was friendly and pleasant. We started off with guacamole and margaritas.  Guacamole was excellent, margaritas large and well made, although mine had salt when I asked for none, and with a little too much ice for my taste. The sampling of hot sauces was greatI think we shocked the waiter a little bit when for our mains we ordered two fish tacos AND the taco sampler. My friend barely tips the scale over 100 lbs, but her big eyes were definitely not as big as her stomach that night. Getting right to the tacos: the presentation was great. The tacos on the sampler were smaller, of course, than regular tacos. The range of quality was a little wider than I thought, but not really unexpected. My least favorite, surprisingly, was the duck; our favorite, by far, was the bacon wrapped scallops. In fact my friend, a long time vegetarian, got a very positive visceral response, which was a bonus. The fish tacos, although very testy, did not win the coveted ""best fish taco"" trophy.  There was a little weirdness at the end of the meal. We declined dessert, but our server never asked if we wanted anything else: more drinks, or coffee. My friend and I joked that maybe we did something wrong and fell out of favor, but after I paid the check, the friendliness was back, names were exchanged, and we were told to please come back.Overall, I am a fan, and I will go back.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,10.8000001907,"fan,friend,walks,fish tacos,friend,Brooklyn,La Slowteria,favorite,mine,search,Guacamole,vegetarian,place,response,staff,guacamole,margaritas,margaritas,fish tacos,tacos,sampling,tacos,favorite,taco sampler,sampler,presentation,scale,range,ice,salt,none,taste,waiter,sauces,mains,bit,stomach,tips,course,quality,weirdness,friendliness,tacos,end,meal,coffee,drinks,anything,dessert,something,greatI,favor,server,fish taco,fish tacos,names,check,eyes,scallops,fact,trophy,bacon","1,1,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.365686893463,0.0721266716719,0.0486524440348,0.0380838960409,0.0333693623543,0.0289842206985,0.0289842206985,0.0289476215839,0.0233041327447,0.0233041327447,0.0119646014646,0.0110291894525,0.0108345616609,0.0106511730701,0.0105100143701,0.0100407777354,0.0100407777354,0.0100238369778,0.00970526132733,0.00968066137284,0.00887341238558,0.0088505987078,0.00807603355497,0.00743279978633,0.00740578444675,0.00704596191645,0.00675232149661,0.00643479079008,0.00592529168352,0.00592529168352,0.00592529168352,0.00592529168352,0.00591645995155,0.00591645995155,0.00591645995155,0.00591645995155,0.00590857164934,0.00590857164934,0.00539483455941,0.00538936816156,0.0047923726961,0.00475925998762,0.00419299351051,0.00401342054829,0.00401342054829,0.00401051482186,0.00401051482186,0.00401051482186,0.00401051482186,0.00400776788592,0.00363962701522,0.0034872344695,0.00319247064181,0.00289279897697,0.00289279897697,0.00277505791746,0.00277505791746,0.00256015057676,0.00201731687412,0.0017633412499,0.00176189863123,0.00165645068046"
La Slowteria,5337,548 Court St,Brooklyn,11231.0,5750,"I REALLY wanted to like Slowteria.  There are very few great authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  Last night I went there for my birthday dinner after hearing very positive reviews. The drinks were wonderful. The presentation was beautiful. The food was a huge disappointment.  The duck in mole negro was almost inedible.  The duck breast that was served was 80% fat (not rendered, not crispy...just thick slabs of fat).  The mole negro was not a real mole negro, it was extremely sweet and thin and oily.  If you want a delicious authentic mole negro close by (and around the same price point), try Fonda.  My boyfriend had the fish in pipian verde.  The tilapia was very dry and overcooked. The rice and beans were very bland as well. The apps were ok.  Great homemade tortillas.  When some of the dishes arrived, they has swapped out ingredients or changed preparations from the way it was described in the menu.  We had the bean dip with cheese and chorizo.  Instead of chorizo, there was roasted pork.  It was delicious, but I wish I had known what I was ordering.  We asked the waiter to describe the guac with seafood.  He said that the seafood was grilled, but when it arrived it was just lightly cured in lime juice.  All of that is fine, I just wish we knew what we were getting in advance.  The server was a sweet guy, but never asked i we enjoyed our meal and could have been more knowledgeable about the menu. Maybe the chef was out of town this week.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Overall, I think the restaurant has a great menu and concept, the food is just really not executed well.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,15.0,"duck breast,disappointment,Slowteria,presentation,restaurants,area,reviews,birthday dinner,seafood,Mexican,duck,mole negro,drinks,fat,mole negro,slabs,mole negro,mole negro,tilapia,menu,beans,boyfriend,chorizo,chorizo,price point,fish,verde,pipian,homemade tortillas,some,dishes,Fonda,pork,preparations,way,ingredients,bean dip,cheese,menu,All,server,waiter,guy,advance,meal,food,restaurant,menu,chef,guac,town,concept,rice,apps,seafood,lime juice","7,7,7,7,2,2,5,4,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,7,7,6,7,7","0.127048119903,0.077306188643,0.0535895042121,0.0495397895575,0.045060750097,0.0420272424817,0.0418134257197,0.0418134257197,0.0265097208321,0.0249571334571,0.0216217655689,0.0214263908565,0.0181197188795,0.0180851500481,0.0172289144248,0.0158281326294,0.0153754334897,0.0144138224423,0.0126996822655,0.0121854506433,0.0121435569599,0.0113448025659,0.011076127179,0.0110681150109,0.0106617771089,0.0106489183381,0.0106489183381,0.0106489183381,0.0106071829796,0.0105985188857,0.0105985188857,0.0104810176417,0.0103180995211,0.00969952344894,0.00969952344894,0.00969952344894,0.00969208031893,0.00969208031893,0.00906512606889,0.0088409120217,0.0086149116978,0.00818359013647,0.00768665084615,0.00721888663247,0.00712398486212,0.00707177817822,0.00680800667033,0.00626811105758,0.0059626842849,0.00519872223958,0.00499318866059,0.00498812505975,0.00460485648364,0.00460053235292,0.0036242059432,0.00316876359284"

You can really judge a place by their cheapest Tequilla and corn tortillas and this place delivered with flying colors. Finally had a tortilla again that was both crunchy and gooey in all the right ways. Tequilla shots are served in a giant 2oz cup with a lime slice .. and the ""low end"" Tequilla was bomb!

They were quite busy as the restaurant was crowded and they had a party going on in another room. I was turned off a bit by the waiter at first. He was rushing us to order and was a bit rude about it. I understand he was making sure we ordered before the kitchen handled the parties meals. We ordered three appetizers and just didn't want my meal to come out right after. We told him we wanted to hold off on ordering our entree and he didn't seem to understand why. He later redeemed himself and cracked a few jokes! Anyway onto the apps! We ordered baked clams just ok, calamari just ok and mussels in white wine just ok. We ordered wine and some margaritas. It was probably one of the worse margaritas I've had in my life! And I'm a big margarita drinker! It wasn't just that it had a lot of alcohol it was the sour mix that was added to it which gave such a bad after taste! I added water in hopes of lightly it, we called the waiter over who added more sweet sour mix to it but honestly it just made it worse! I didn't and couldn't finish it. I tasted my fiancées Cabernet and did not like it so I stuck to just drinking water. Now onto the entree I ordered chicken Marsala again just an okay meal. For dessert I had a cappuccino and tiramisu again just ok and was missing that coffee flavor I love to it!. I was really disappointed as I heard great things from my friends they did comment they've had much better meals there before and don't know what happened tonight.

Overall the room was quite crowded and the service while very friendly and accommodating was quite slow. Our party of 11 was seated at 530 and it was nearly 8 by the time our entrees arrived.  We started with an assortment of appetizers. Very good baked clams with delicious toasty breadcrumbs and nice sized clams, fried calamari which was crisp and tender but not at all greasy. Those two apps were the best dishes of the night. We got Mussels in wine sauce and while nice sized I got a few mussels that were gritty and that was very off putting. The other app was Mozzarella in Carozza which I didn't try since its really just a grilled cheese sandwich.   For my main I got the diver scallops piccata. The scallops were large and they gave a decent amount but the sauce, a sauce I make myself often was lacking any real lemon flavor or even a lemon garnish and was quite bland and for some reason had artichoke hearts and asparagus which I've never seen in a piccata. I don't eat Italian food out much because as an Italian my standards are probably too high.   Probably better off sticking to basic stuff like the clams,calamari and a chicken parm or pasta in red sauce dish here.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,7.09999990463,"place,birthday,uncles,cousin,seniors,Chuck E Cheese,Mozzarella,party,birthdays,fried calamari,app,service,room,hearts,dishes,wine sauce,clams,clams,entrees,appetizers,assortment,breadcrumbs,mussels,grilled cheese sandwich,Mussels,piccata,asparagus,lemon garnish,reason,food,clams,Carozza,calamari,sauce dish,stuff,chicken parm,pasta,standards,sauce,sauce,Italian,scallops,diver scallops,lemon flavor,amount","7,4,7,1,1,6,3,3,4,6,6,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7","0.103079169989,0.0963619425893,0.0845729932189,0.0845729932189,0.0845729932189,0.0576346851885,0.05097810179,0.0468943938613,0.042332187295,0.0360460355878,0.028738502413,0.018620301038,0.018620301038,0.0179725829512,0.0152260707691,0.0140257962048,0.0130894174799,0.0130894174799,0.0104888593778,0.0104507487267,0.0104507487267,0.0104212826118,0.00966065749526,0.0094812726602,0.00875186361372,0.00706600956619,0.00706600956619,0.00706600956619,0.00706600956619,0.00705748563632,0.00613452866673,0.00561629002914,0.00557991443202,0.00557991443202,0.00488219130784,0.00488219130784,0.00488219130784,0.00458749057725,0.00446807732806,0.00419371761382,0.00407633418217,0.0039125024341,0.0035486635752,0.00310057355091,0.00310057355091"

Possibly...I came here with my Asian GF and when she went to the wrong door (the private party room is next door to restaurant) one of the guys outside asked if she was part of the party.  She said no and she was directed to the restaurant door.  At this same time I walked up From parking the car and said to the guy ""how you doing?"" in the customary Brooklyn greeting.  He immediately went to open the door for me and my GF, followed us in and made sure we were seated right away. The waiter came and brought water and while handing out the menu's, asked if we wanted a drink from the bar.  I told him that my date wanted red wine and I wanted a Jack & Coke so they discussed wine options.  After she selected her wine he left and we looked over the menu.  We choose our appetizer just as he arrived with the drinks and told him our choice.  We also already decided on an entree and ordered that as well.Here is a funny moment:GF: OMG... my glass is filled to the rim!  Me: That's how it is...GF: No, usually its half way or maybe 3/4 full... this is topped off and delicious.Me: So?GF: Is this because you are Italian and they can tell your from the neighborhood?I just leaned back and smiled. GF: Are you serious?Anyway, the service was amazing the entire time and when the food came out it was hot and delicious. I had the Chicken Marsala and she had some seafood dish.  Their prices are great compared to the amount of food they provide. We came back here again with my father and got the same great service and this time I had the stuffed pork chop.  OMG this pork chop was HUGE and stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto and cooked to perfection.  Even came with veggies and a side pasta.  3 person meal with drinks came to about $115... such a great deal for great food.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,9.89999961853,"guy,GF,Restaurant,some,issue,place,part,Yelpers,waiter,door,service,GF,Brooklyn,pork chop,food,door,restaurant,party,one,party room,way,Italian,guys,restaurant door,water,drink,red wine,guy,drinks,appetizer,menu,service,food,greeting,car,bar,Jack,wine options,menu,food,wine,entree,glass,rim,Asian,choice,Chicken Marsala,seafood dish,amount,father,prices,food,Coke,drinks,person meal,mozzarella,prosciutto,perfection,veggies,side pasta,deal,service,delicious.Me,neighborhood","1,7,2,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,3,1,2,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,4,6,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.604968070984,0.0588524639606,0.0304681509733,0.026063574478,0.0243149641901,0.0243149641901,0.021445684135,0.0144590968266,0.0143641205505,0.00821796339005,0.00715527590364,0.00665450142696,0.00655429670587,0.00637700920925,0.00597911560908,0.00595739344135,0.00553573481739,0.00553573481739,0.0054646153003,0.00539589719847,0.00475363712758,0.00459882244468,0.00440661190078,0.0040124761872,0.00389760616235,0.00370609434322,0.0037005697377,0.00338339223526,0.0033779789228,0.00309046125039,0.0030762962997,0.00300214672461,0.00299461442046,0.00296038738452,0.00296038738452,0.00294961640611,0.00294521776959,0.00294521776959,0.00293255248107,0.00270164455287,0.00269237929024,0.0026854230091,0.00268270052038,0.00268270052038,0.00260987272486,0.00208644079976,0.00199906877242,0.00199906877242,0.00199753325433,0.00199608644471,0.00187485048082,0.00186565704644,0.00174382748082,0.00173335836735,0.00152652885299,0.00138102588244,0.00138102588244,0.00138102588244,0.00138012797106,0.00138012797106,0.00137927441392,0.00128108228091,0.00090823858045,0.000878224789631"

La Sorrentina Ristorante,5338,6522 11th Ave,Brooklyn,11219.0,147978,"I've been coming here for years, both for dinner and for parties/events. The food is good - but there are some misses for sure. Last night, my boyfriend and I went to La Sorrentina to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. We had a $100 gift certificate (or we likely would have gone to Mama Rao's - my favorite, and right down the street) and decided to try to spend as much of it as possible. Appetizers: Crab cake with Creamed Corn - Good in theory. The outside of the crab cake was crisp, but not greasy, which I liked. The inside had a lot of shredded crab inside, which was nice, but I didn't get that creamy texture or any bite from it at all. The corn was ok - it was nice along with the crab cake, but on its own, was just creamed corn. Mozzarella in carrozza: Usually, this is one of my favorite things to order. Two thumbs down though, dry, bland...my boyfriend said it best ""it tastes like nothing."" They seemed surprised that we left 4 pieces on the plate. Entree: Chicken Sophia: My boyfriend ordered Chicken Sofia, which he said was just ok. It was missing some flavor and was definitely under seasoned. Also, I expected the chicken to be rolled, since it was stuffed, but instead was two pieces of chicken placed on top of each other with the stuffing (prosciutto and mozzarella) in between the two slices. It was messy and hard to eat. It was in a marsala sauce though, which was delicious. Veal Marsala: I am a sucker for Marsala and I don't cook veal at home so I like to get it when I am out to dinner. The veal cutlets were VERY tiny,  almost like medallions. They were a little tougher than I was expecting them to be and I was disappointed in the texture and chewiness. Again, the marsala sauce was a home run and the only redeeming thing about this plate. They also served both entrees with a side of unseasoned (likely frozen) vegetables. Dessert: This was the highlight. Tartuffo: My boyfriend will order tartuffo no matter where we are or how full we are. It's his favorite. La Sorrentina did not disappoint us here - the serving was HUGE and it was delicious. The chocolate on the outside was soft enough to spoon into but cold enough to stay hard on the plate - perfect. Tiramisu: I ordered the tiramisu, which is one of my favorite desserts. It was delicious...not too soggy...just creamy enough. I also ordered a cappuccino which was fine. My advice to anyone going here: Go with the Penne Vodka (which is my usual go to dish here...delicious and a HUGE serving) or the Chicken Francese (their sauce is very, very good). Skip an appetizer unless you're getting a cold antipasto (like a caprese salad...yum) and have a piece of bread...it's warm and fresh. Don't skip dessert.

Needless to say, I was stuffed before my entree even arrived.I chose baked clams as my appetizer. They were pretty good, cleaned well and baked so there was a crust on them. I just wish they added some fresh herbs to the breading. For pasta I chose penne vodka; it was ok but it desperately needed salt (which is a big pet peeve for me!) and it was a little watery. My main dish was chicken Francese; I don't normally choose meat or poultry as my entree when I dine out at Italian restaurants and I was reassured why. The chicken didn't seem to be cleaned well and they had left it on the pan too long so the bottom sear was a little charred. Overall, the meal was pretty good.

This place was more than I expected.We ordered stuffed artichoke (special of the night) mixed green salad and shrimp scampi to share. The stuffed artichoke was great, light and flavorful. I don't normally order this in restaurants bc it can never live up to mine or my mothers recipe, I must say this was pretty good. The mixed greens weren't anything to rave about but was good, needed a bit more dressing and salt to taste in my opinion but we enjoyed it. The shrimp scampi was amazing. Again, light and flavorful. The shrimp were HUGE. Perfectly cooked and cleaned well. It was served with a slice of lemon, which I loved and of course just added to the flavor of the dish.

La Sorrentina Ristorante,5338,6522 11th Ave,Brooklyn,11219.0,50214,Visited La Sorrentina Ristorante for a party. It was a large party 50+ people so I was prepared to not have the best food experience. Generally in larger parties with a set menu everything is massed produced. Quite frankly the food was average. We started with mozz and tomato salad. The mozz was the supermarket variety. I'm sure you know what I mean. For pasta I had the penne vodka but the penne was over cooked. So far the meal was as expected: average. For a main course I had the veal with mushrooms which by this point I was stuffing myself on their delicious bread. So needless to say I was only able to have 2 bites and wrapped up the rest. For dessert they brought out this small almond ice cream cup which turned out to be quite delicious and the best part of the meal (other than the bread). I probably won't be back in the area to try this place again so I leave it with 3 Stars which is being generous. The service was good. They were attentive and available for drink orders often.,3.0 star rating,"Madison, NJ",1,1,0.20000000298,7.40000009537,"party,supermarket variety,La Sorrentina Ristorante,average,place,people,food experience,veal,food,parties,mozz,menu everything,average,penne,Stars,bread,tomato salad,almond ice cream cup,penne vodka,pasta,course,mushrooms,part,bites,meal,bread,area,service,drink orders,rest,dessert","3,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,7","0.169406190515,0.0761177539825,0.0758650973439,0.0757343918085,0.0666316747665,0.0650425478816,0.0611040219665,0.0366307869554,0.0317569971085,0.0315851941705,0.0265471544117,0.0233924724162,0.0233077239245,0.0212964657694,0.0164960939437,0.0162887498736,0.0157126523554,0.0156987272203,0.0156195806339,0.0156195806339,0.0155755849555,0.0155755849555,0.0143724698573,0.0142392357811,0.0121500464156,0.0121500464156,0.0106219714507,0.00877672247589,0.0073443679139,0.00467262975872,0.00466747954488"

This place is family owned and operated so it gives off the Brooklyn Italian vibes. The place is always crowded because it is the only decent Italian place around. As for the food it's not bad. Better than average! The pasta isn't the best but the main dishes and appetizers are what shine. The baked clams are a must. So go with those for you app. For the main dish I was boring and went with a veal parm dish. The sauce is what's really good here. The tomatoe sauce was the star of the dish. The portion was huge! But it was really good! I highly recommend. My family got the fish dishes and they were impressed.

I'm giving La Sorrentina Ristoante five stars because the service was amazing!! The waiters were very polite, patient and humorous. The food was decent and good. The place gives off a classy family friendly vibe. After we paid and left to my cousin's car, we discovered that she accidental locked her car keys inside her car. It was an older model, so we couldn't unlock it digitally. We panicked for a good 10 minutes. We then went back inside to see if we could get help. We then met Joe, the owner of the restaurant and he will forever be the MVP. He attempted to open the car without breaking the windshield and even called his friend from the police emergency unit to help us. He waited and kept us company until the emergency unit came (45 minutes at least).  We felt blessed and grateful. Joe went out his way and beyond to help us. In the busy food/service industry, it's very hard to come across someone who would take out their time, especially the boss, to genuinely help others.

La Sorrentina Ristorante,5338,6522 11th Ave,Brooklyn,11219.0,1966,"We have a bit of misrepresentation to deal with here.This Yelp profile is for the restaurant, not the pizza place up the block! The Pizza place has it's own Yelp profile and the restaurant does not offer pizza!So let's talk about La Sorrentina Ristorante and maybe help fellow Yelpers get what they want at an Italian restaurant...First off, an authentic Italian restaurant (or anything close to authentic) takes no prisoners when it comes to your order. The menus are mostly untouched for years because the food they offer never changes (Specials come on a separate menu or are told verbally). If you look closely, you will see EVERY item offered in the dish in parentheses, so what you see is what you get! These types of Italian restaurants love to offer bacon or pancetta in their dishes, and if you take a quick overview of La Sorrentina's menu you will see these items in a majority of the dishes, if you do not see it written in print, you are not getting it!Another nugget for you to chew on (literally) is how you should order your pasta. The majority of Italians like their pasta soft and that's the standard when ordering at a restaurant. If you do not like ""mushy"" pasta then you must as for your dish al dente. Again, You will NOT get your dish al dente unless you ask!La Sorrentina Ristorante takes up a nice chunk of real estate on 66th street and 11th avenue, with a party room attached to two store's worth of restaurant. The inside is typical old world Italian with wine bottles lining the walls along with Italian scenic art, making for a semi authentic feel a a slightly romantic atmosphere. The place is loud when just half full because of the Italian music playing through the speakers and the loud conversations held at each table (you always get a couple of large groups a night). There's a full bar at the back too where you can converse. Waiters are all Italian and very nice to you upon entering/ordering.On my latest visit we had 7 people celebrating a birthday and were ready to eat like champs. We decided on family style appetizers and were given baked clams, mozzarella en carozza (battered and fried mozzarella), fried calamari, fresh mozzarella with tomato, roasted peppers and olives along with cold shrimp cocktail. Tons of bread with butter and olive oil is served before the apps complimentary. Everything was good except the clams, which did not have the waste removed and one clam had a small piece of shell inside. Everything else served for appetizers was very good to excellent. I also had a Caesar salad which was cheesy and delicious. For main courses, i went with the cavatelli broccoli rabe which was fantastic! I added a little graded cheese and a touch of crushed red pepper to give it just a little kick and i enjoyed it. My wife went with the penne alla vodka which i sampled and thought it was very good also. Other items ordered were ossobuco (which i think is gross) but my father in law ripped into it like it was his last meal, chicken catchatore and so much more which everyone said they enjoyed. For dessert there were double espresso's on the table along with spumoni and tartufo (vanilla and chocolate ice cream inside a chocolate shell)Overall our meal was very enjoyable and we were satisfied walking out the door but one thing to keep in mind is La Sorrentia's prices are on the high side. We spent $380 bucks on 7 people which is high. You could probably get similar food for about $50 cheaper at a few other restaurants in the immediate area, but it's all a matter of preference. You should try La Sorrentia if you are in the area and like Italian food because you will enjoy it, just keep my tips in mind when ordering and expect a decent sized bill.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.10000000149,14.1000003815,"menus,Yelpers,Pizza place,Italians,profile,restaurant,restaurant,pizza,restaurant,misrepresentation,here.,block,bit,Yelp,restaurant,overview,types,matter,meal,al dente,pizza,prisoners,order,profile,clams,people,anything,penne alla vodka,La Sorrentia,standard,La Sorrentina Ristorante,restaurants,back,dish,dishes,dishes,Specials,item,items,food,more,menu,menu,area,father,majority,restaurant,restaurant,parentheses,pancetta,bacon,dish,birthday,dish,place,touch,pasta,couple,La Sorrentina,pasta,pasta,inside,chunk,bar,majority,mozzarella,fried mozzarella,mozzarella,table,peppers,family style appetizers,print,nugget,street,real estate,avenue,party room,worth,store,art,wine bottles,walls,atmosphere,groups,conversations,speakers,music,La Sorrentina Ristorante,meal,visit,champs,fried calamari,tomato,carozza,shrimp cocktail,olives,apps,olive oil,butter,bread,Caesar salad,broccoli rabe,Waiters,items,everyone,espresso,chocolate shell,table,restaurants,chicken catchatore,door,dessert,vanilla,chocolate ice cream,spumoni,tartufo,food,thing,bill,mind,mind,side,preference,tips,Everything,Everything,prices,clam,La Sorrentia,wife,shell,appetizers,red pepper,waste,piece,courses,cheese,kick","7,1,7,2,7,2,2,6,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,6,1,3,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,7,2,5,6,7,7,3,4,1,5,3,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,6,6,6,7,7,1,6,1,6,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4","0.0654423311353,0.0607697181404,0.0381872095168,0.0379356108606,0.0323881693184,0.0311385486275,0.0298699047416,0.0290967896581,0.0248252730817,0.0231883302331,0.0231883302331,0.0231883302331,0.0231883302331,0.019474092871,0.0181118510664,0.0173910073936,0.0159196238965,0.0158432684839,0.014976548031,0.0139534296468,0.0138771617785,0.0128600439057,0.0126251783222,0.0126251783222,0.0113499118015,0.0113205183297,0.0110494000837,0.00997798517346,0.00943228509277,0.00833342690021,0.00748177571222,0.00684696342796,0.00658426247537,0.0060080983676,0.00599113944918,0.00599113944918,0.00561964930966,0.00546062551439,0.00544520979747,0.00541156763211,0.00540044391528,0.00527616543695,0.0052421274595,0.00505414744839,0.0048184231855,0.00476812338457,0.00461251102388,0.00459572626278,0.00418364489451,0.00417183013633,0.00417183013633,0.00402777921408,0.00402252841741,0.00402096798643,0.00390816712752,0.00376503798179,0.00361446128227,0.00359716103412,0.00354764657095,0.00353904138319,0.00353087158874,0.00342388357967,0.00325945834629,0.00324632623233,0.00321146054193,0.0031995351892,0.0031995351892,0.0031995351892,0.00319073046558,0.00291007268243,0.00291007268243,0.002816186985,0.002816186985,0.00279945484363,0.00279945484363,0.00279945484363,0.00279945484363,0.00279945484363,0.00279945484363,0.00279527739622,0.00279527739622,0.00279527739622,0.00279527739622,0.00279154581949,0.00279154581949,0.00279154581949,0.00279154581949,0.00260069477372,0.00257898587734,0.00254856026731,0.00254856026731,0.00254597491585,0.00254597491585,0.00254597491585,0.00254597491585,0.00254597491585,0.00254358374514,0.00254358374514,0.00254358374514,0.00254358374514,0.00253107398748,0.00252924044617,0.00239199656062,0.00237574032508,0.0022016891744,0.00219978182577,0.00215948629193,0.00215948629193,0.00214520888403,0.00189036340453,0.00188924849499,0.00188924849499,0.00188924849499,0.00188924849499,0.00188924849499,0.00188924849499,0.00164103321731,0.00160208251327,0.00150120211765,0.00149493047502,0.00149250857066,0.00130782392807,0.00130638142582,0.00127299781889,0.00124952336773,0.00124850077555,0.001227454748,0.00111471617129,0.0011120128911,0.00106888765004,0.000951506546699,0.000950727844611,0.000948657514527,0.000944985717069,0.000832399178762,0.000830476114061,0.000829906726722,0.000589208095334"

La Strada,5339,5023 10th Ave,Brooklyn,11219.0,35124,La Strada has good plain pizza slices. Plain pizza slice is their most popular and freshly made pizza. My husband and I use to like their chicken roll. But the past 5-6 orders of chicken roll has been utter disappointment. The chicken in the chicken roll is over cooked. The outside bread is soggy which ruins the taste and chew of the chicken roll. We also liked their grilled chicken ceasar salad. They are slacking off on their chicken. My husband went in last week to get a slice of their chicken pizza. All he asked for was some pieces of chopped onions. The guy behind the counter (one of the brother) charged $1.25 for the couple of pieces of onions. I guess the prices have gone up only in this pizzeria.

The food is decent,  the portions are small, but the prices are definitely fair, and the guacamole is great. But honestly, the place just has WAY too much attitude for the hole-in-the-wall, authentic vibe they strive for. In the past I knew the restaurant was BYOB, and so, I showed up with my family and two bottles of wine. The owner, or at least I think it was the owner, came over and said, ""Hi guys, I'm going to ask you to take the bottles of wine off the table..."" It sounds innocuous enough, but his tone was scolding and immediately rubbed me the wrong way. He went on to explain that they would soon be obtaining their liquor license, had recently been raided by whatever liquor authority, and now were forced to enforce a no-liquor policy. Completely understandable. Eager to convince myself that this guy meant no harm, I offered, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. In the past we always just brought some beer."" Apparently this offended him, or he thought I was challenging his authority, as he let me know that their policy had changed MONTHS ago. Clearly, I lived under a rock. So, whatever. Our food came and the guacamole was good, which assuaged my anger for the time being. Yet when he delivered my mom's tacos, my mom said, ""Thanks, could I have a fork?""Exasperated, he turned to her and said, ""Fork? You're holding your forks. These are tacos. They are meant to be eaten with your hands."" And walked away. I am not exaggerating. He never returned with a fork. It was around that time that I decided I couldn't deal. I will never return. Yes, I understand that tacos are meant to be eaten with your hands, but come on. Who the hell cares! Yes, the food was good, but it's not worth it.

Yes, it tends to be either out of the way or overpriced, but it's here. La Superior splits the difference; it's a little out of the way and only slightly overpriced (due to the small portion sizes). Then again, the bill for four of us was under $50 before tip, so we're not talking big cash outlays here.The food is good, and I'm saying this after spending a few month in LA recently. Guac was good. The melted cheese and mushroom app was good, and heavy. (The gorditas with cheese and chorizo were good as well, but everything else we had was better. Don't think I'd order them again). Fish tacos (grilled, not fried) were good, with a nice amount of spice. Carnitas tacos were generous with the meat, cilantro and onion, and tasty enough that I should have ordered three instead of two. The small corn tortillas wrapping the tacos made me wish they'd used two instead of one for each taco, but this is a small complaint. The salsa verde that arrived with most of the dishes was fine, but could have had a bit more kick. Sure, the place is small and a little cramped, but the service was fine, and the music was good.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,194253,"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night with my boyfriend and another friend. They had rave reviews about this place so I was excited. Last time they had been here it had been BYOB so we stopped and got a 6 pack. As far as we could tell from their website we had no indication that it still wasn't. We showed up and quickly realized they now had bar...which was fine.They were pretty packed at about 7:30 and shoved the 3 of us into a 2-top that was surrounded by people. I felt pretty pinned in and generally uncomfortable. I ordered a $5 margarita which was fine, but I definitely wish it was larger, but this is Williamsburg, after all. We ordered  chips and salsa and when it arrived at our table I was surprised to see how many salsas they gave us. The only problem was that the serving dishes were so narrow and shallow that we couldn't even dip our chips in them! Pretty lame. The table was so small that we couldn't fit all of our food on it and had to juggle. My boyfriend loved his tacos and I admittedly liked my jalapeno rellenos. I was a little surprised by my quesedilla (pescadilla)-how small it was and was actually an empanada, but it tasted real good.Overall, decent food but not worth it for how much of a cluster fuck it was and the food was so tiny. If I want Mexican food, I really don't want to pay $20 for a couple of small bites, cramped space, so loud that we couldn't hear our friend from across the table. I will not be going back.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,106275,"OK, so I'm not like some of the folks on Yelp who have been to a billion taco stands in Mexico, or even in Southern California, but I know a good meal when I taste it and this is the real deal.  Personally, I love being able to order lots of small plates to share or mix and match for a meal with lots of variety, so the menu suits me perfectly.  If you're someone who doesn't like to share or just wants to keep it simple with one larger entree, you'll find this menu frustrating.  I tried the slow roasted pork tacos, queso fundito (melted Chihuaha cheese with mushrooms and tortillas... yum), and I also tried out the Gorditas.  Their freshly made to order guacamole and tasty salsa sampler were great, even if they were on the smaller side.  The only slightly strange thing was the lack of booze to wash down all the chorizo and queso in this place.  You can run next door to buy some beer or wine to bring to your table, but forget ordering it off the menu...  A bit strange, but hey: it'll save you some cash so you can get an extra taco or two instead of a pricey cocktail.My usual complaint in restaurants that serve small plates is how expensive it can all stack up to be, but that wasn't the case here.  I was impressed by how reasonable the dishes were.  It's definitely not a place where you'll be taking home a doggie bag of leftovers to eat for the rest of the week, but you can actually leave this place with a full stomach and only slightly empty pockets, which was a pretty good feeling.There seems to be a heated debate over service at La Superior from my fellow reviewers.  My friends and I were treated just fine, and at one point were helped by the aforementioned ""bearded fellow"". His customer service wasn't the best; he briskly yanked the menu out of my friend's hand as he was placing his order, which seemed a bit out of line, but other than this I'll have to refrain from commenting.  I am white, and my company was all white, so I really can't comment on his racism.Places like this make me looooove being in Williamsburg.  Like so many of my favorite spots in the 'burg, this one is modestly tucked away on a side street, bustling with lots of people, yummy tacos, and small plates to die for.  They've turned a makeshift space into a charming and comfortable restaurant with a good amount of seating space and a kitchen that looks out into the dining room.  The decor is really cool; bright colors and cool wallpaper make it homey and quirky without being too kitschy.  Thumbs up, La Superior!",5.0 star rating,"NY, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,10.5,"meal,someone,folks,plates,taco,some,restaurants,lots,Yelp,Mexico,Southern California,thing,place,stomach,place,menu,menu,pork tacos,lots,taco,meal,variety,entree,mushrooms,tortillas,cheese,queso fundito,place,menu,many,beer,side,rest,queso,complaint,amount,debate,doggie bag,case,service,salsa sampler,chorizo,booze,table,wine,cash,company,Places,home,leftovers,pockets,Chihuaha,lots,order,side street,burg,spots,one,people,tacos,La Superior,cocktail.My,restaurant,decor,Gorditas,seating space,door,dining room,kitchen,colors,wallpaper,guacamole,customer service,menu,Williamsburg,dishes,friends,bit,friend,best,La Superior,reviewers,point,line,hand,space","7,1,1,6,7,1,2,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,3,2,2,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,2","0.245849072933,0.222920268774,0.0977630913258,0.0605770349503,0.0337869636714,0.0314216427505,0.0158652700484,0.0150280632079,0.0148999383673,0.0148999383673,0.0148999383673,0.0130634931847,0.0095283659175,0.00841576233506,0.00741779617965,0.00619054632261,0.00615886319429,0.00590786151588,0.00575227662921,0.00528436852619,0.00523261586204,0.00457875430584,0.00455530360341,0.00453873770311,0.00453873770311,0.00453873770311,0.00453873770311,0.00411512935534,0.00410817516968,0.00397272408009,0.00362747441977,0.00348466425203,0.00347908819094,0.00347786513157,0.0034668087028,0.00345312594436,0.00339109706692,0.0032646136824,0.00323171541095,0.00316450465471,0.00304893520661,0.00304298521951,0.00304298521951,0.00303784036078,0.00303784036078,0.00303330947645,0.00281478930265,0.00278927315958,0.00276876077987,0.00276876077987,0.00276876077987,0.00268789031543,0.00258926558308,0.0024280003272,0.00206045131199,0.00206045131199,0.00206045131199,0.00206045131199,0.00206045131199,0.00192957173567,0.00187359843403,0.00179588026367,0.00179126323201,0.00174458569381,0.00174178462476,0.00162918702699,0.0015320321545,0.00142532680184,0.00142532680184,0.00142423145007,0.00142423145007,0.00132057780866,0.00123581278604,0.0012246024562,0.00122075423133,0.00120059435721,0.00103581184521,0.00103476084769,0.00103476084769,0.000964521837886,0.000962885969784,0.000907172099687,0.000906171451788,0.000905251945369,0.000905251945369,0.000853234843817"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,82212,"It's pathetic that restaurants think they can get by on their food alone - to the point that service is so horribly neglected it turns off clientele. It's a shame I won't ever enjoy La Superior's tacos and guac again - they were really good. But, the service was some of the worst I've ever had, I rather just enjoy my beloved Mexican food elsewhere... OK the details... Went here on Fri night - 5 of us total - squished into a 4-top, no problem for us. It was BYOB, so we had 2 bottles of wine total - not much booze for 5 people. Ordered apps and they came quickly (chips/guac, fried scallion). The food is incredible and it's fast. We ordered a round of tacos straight away - 2 each, since we didn't know the size and knew we could get more. We ordered a second round. When these came, we asked if we wanted the check, we said we didn't b/c we'd prob get more food. We were told that there was a wait for tables and to be considerate and give up the table. Yes, ok I get that, but we were still eating, we weren't holding the table just sitting around and we were paying customers. We decided midway through round-two that another round of this deliciously cheap food would be in order. Again, we were told of the wait and they needed our table. We explained we were still eating, still ordering and still drinking - so what's the problem?! The waiter reluctantly took our order for more food, though, we were told that was it, no more food after this - they needed the table. Another waiter dropped off the check before the final round of our food came. The food came (still excellent). The waiter stopped by and asked if the bill was ready - it's a cash only place, there CLEARLY wasn't cash on the table.- while my friends were still mid-bite. I curtly explained we were still IN THE MIDDLE OF EATING and we'd pay when we were done. All in all, 5 of us were there for a little over an hour in total. We spent over $80 on $3 tacos and aps. We were asked 4 times to leave/hurry up in the course of our meal and never once were not eating/ordering. It was a rushed and unpleasant experience. You can get good Mexican food anywhere (Mole, Hecho en Dumbo, Tacos Morimotos, Radio Mexico, etc.) and all these places come with great service. Good food and horrible service isn't worth it. We left less than a 10% tip and felt that was generous. On the way out, my friend spoke to the manager and said that the service was terrible and not only did we order a lot of food and sat cramped in a little table, but we spent a considerable amount of money at a cheap place and were consistently eating. We didn't deserve to be treated like that! The manager merely shrugged his shoulders and explained that's what they do, since there's people waiting for a table. Never going back. And the only reason this place got 2 stars was that the food was really good - can't deny that...",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,18.6000003815,"restaurants,service,shame,food,point,place,food,service,tacos,guac,clientele,some,apps,worst,details,food,problem,food,La Superior,round,tacos,food,food,food,food,more,food,problem,people,guac,round,tables,experience,waiter,food,Mexican,wait,bottles,booze,scallion,chips,wait,table,order,waiter,round,manager,round,waiter,food,table,order,cash,places,table,service,check,food,check,cash,size,c,customers,service,service,BYOB,Fri night - 5,place,manager,friend,table,table,food,table,tip,way,lot,place,people,reason,Mole,money,amount,shoulders,friends,tacos,Radio Mexico,Tacos Morimotos,Dumbo,Hecho,all,total,stars,EATING,aps,meal,course,anywhere","2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,1,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,3,4,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.188731983304,0.128344491124,0.0697997584939,0.0555301010609,0.0294525045902,0.0287119969726,0.0261320937425,0.0239178668708,0.0206826161593,0.0160513687879,0.0154840890318,0.0148897320032,0.0148818399757,0.0139781944454,0.013927471824,0.0122583610937,0.0119614358991,0.00867660995573,0.00832805130631,0.00712444726378,0.00712444726378,0.00678408332169,0.00677453493699,0.00671520503238,0.00669871410355,0.00619801273569,0.00612597353756,0.00606646900997,0.00605247588828,0.00604066997766,0.00585893122479,0.0058172675781,0.00580333732069,0.00567961996421,0.00557745667174,0.00552699714899,0.0054228650406,0.00529585173354,0.00529585173354,0.00528551964089,0.00528551964089,0.00507563212886,0.00492000253871,0.00490696914494,0.00487504946068,0.00482953106984,0.0048283226788,0.00480437185615,0.00462793558836,0.0045499112457,0.00449526263401,0.00444484734908,0.00439798412845,0.00434365356341,0.00413186475635,0.0041096964851,0.00405524531379,0.00375605514273,0.00368786742911,0.00368294562213,0.0035570692271,0.00354803283699,0.00354052777402,0.00344624812715,0.00344459968619,0.00334094464779,0.00314300996251,0.0028865900822,0.00273855915293,0.00273855915293,0.00272345985286,0.00272115785629,0.00257558189332,0.00251764059067,0.0023969814647,0.00239591510035,0.00239591510035,0.00224370090291,0.00220566987991,0.00197766162455,0.00183015852235,0.00165864930023,0.00165864930023,0.00165724696126,0.00159497791901,0.00142547837459,0.00142012466677,0.00142012466677,0.00142012466677,0.00142012466677,0.00132509379182,0.00132509379182,0.00122135167476,0.0010549306171,0.00105371396057,0.00105314527173,0.00105314527173,0.00105207646266"

I took two bites and gave it to my friend who just scooped the meat out. If you do go to La Superior, get some tacos.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,24089,"If you want real deal Mexican... You came to the right place. And they have a plaque on the wall to prove it! Situated a bit off the beaten path in Williamsburg on Berry between South 2nd and South 3rd you will find this gem of a spot. I first started going to La Superior back in February and haven't looked back since. It has now become a Friday night meal for my girlfriend and I about twice a month.Price: Be warned... the tacos are cheap, but they're minuscule (expect to order at least five to be satisfied). With that said expect the portions to be small, this isn't the dive spot to be stuffed on a ten spot. You can easily spend $25 to $30 for two here without drinks in order to be satisfied.Menu: The menu is a ample to suit anyone's needs, and every dish I've eaten here is amazing. Atmosphere: Drop dead by day during the week... but come 7 P.M. it's one of the most happening spots around. Close quarters seating and dim lighting make for a relaxing and intimate experience. When it's busy, as it will be on most nights, expect a multitude of people to crowd the bar waiting for seating... If you're on of them, order a drink or wait outside for a bit...Service: Can be a bit slow and chaotic when the place is packed... they usually have two waitresses, a busser, and a bar tender on staff to handle everyone (you may wait longer for your drink than the food at times... which is why I suggest you get a drink while waiting). Service is always on point though... never any mishaps and the wait is worth it.Suggestions: This is going to be long.... Rule #1 - Sharing is caring here. You can get a ton of different options if you share.Rule #2 - You can always put more food into your order later... so don't over order off the bat.The bang for your buck here is in the quesadillas (not you're everyday... these are fried to a crisp, filled with heaven, and topped with cheese) and a bunch of the starters... i.e. queso fundido (chorizo or mushrooms, take your pick but always ask for more tortillas off the bat... you're going to need them). Black bean soup is solid and filling, comes with peppers, cheese, and crisped tortillas to add in. You must also try a bunch of tacos... they are small but full of flavor. The Jalapenos Rellenos is also a must! The Ezquites is a staple as well (some of the best corn I've ever had).I haven't dabbled into the main dishes too much. Portions are moderate, but what I've had hits the spot just right.  High Point: If you do it right, you'll feel like you ate one of the better meals of you're life at a bargain. Drinks are strong and delicious!!! Go with a smaller crowd for optimal seating and sharing experience (2-4).Low Point: BIG ONE = FOOD COMES WHEN IT'S DONE!!! (Expect a hodge podge on your small table). Waits can be extensive if you catch them at a busy time or you have a ton of people with you. You're tab can run up really quickly if you're ordering only tacos, and nothing else to fill you up.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,15.1999998093,"deal,plaque,gem,spot,meal,Mexican,bit,one,place,tacos,wall,path,girlfriend,times,High Point,South,life,dive spot,Berry,Williamsburg,La Superior,Ezquites,experience,Waits,spot,drinks,portions,Menu,menu,order,drink,Price,anyone,needs,spots,drink,drink,dish,Service,ton,bit,waitresses,food,wait,mishaps,multitude,experience,food,order,order,nights,people,seating,bar,Service,bang,cheese,Jalapenos Rellenos,Atmosphere,lighting,busser,staff,bar tender,Suggestions,spot,Drinks,options,quesadillas,buck,heaven,place,everyone,dishes,meals,Portions,Rule #2,corn,some,bargain,starters,Rule #1 - Sharing,FOOD,Point,tacos,bunch,hodge podge,sharing,seating,people,ton,crowd,table,bunch,nothing,tab,tacos,Black bean soup,pick,tortillas,cheese,tortillas,chorizo,queso fundido,mushrooms,bat,peppers,flavor,BIG ONE","7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5","0.0471150241792,0.0435286834836,0.0350975878537,0.0319564305246,0.0287331715226,0.0279813334346,0.0279764030129,0.026568910107,0.0256792381406,0.0254167784005,0.0223628021777,0.0222816616297,0.0221677981317,0.0201631207019,0.01833268255,0.0170171409845,0.0163006819785,0.0150568075478,0.0132075492293,0.0132075492293,0.0131702991202,0.0131422262639,0.0126699311659,0.0125204641372,0.0121419904754,0.0121214818209,0.0118351383135,0.0118151465431,0.0118151465431,0.0106068244204,0.0104710264131,0.00847290456295,0.0084420805797,0.0084420805797,0.00816240534186,0.00813531782478,0.00812768377364,0.00797849800438,0.00791520625353,0.00760240433738,0.00711808633059,0.00711140502244,0.00711140502244,0.00709938211367,0.00691979937255,0.0065186554566,0.00648808665574,0.00648703891784,0.00648703891784,0.00648259511217,0.00648093596101,0.00648093596101,0.00648093596101,0.00648093596101,0.00647436501458,0.0063185961917,0.00589244766161,0.00577166024595,0.00569105846807,0.00567660154775,0.00565927568823,0.00565927568823,0.00565927568823,0.00564970495179,0.00551375607029,0.00517027452588,0.00516227865592,0.00515874195844,0.00515874195844,0.00515538873151,0.00496130110696,0.00492269638926,0.00438977358863,0.00438549229875,0.00411807745695,0.00401583919302,0.00384054030292,0.00384054030292,0.00383679429069,0.00365192373283,0.00349555141293,0.00333516928367,0.00333516928367,0.00333100860007,0.00320239714347,0.00304971286096,0.00303335813805,0.00303335813805,0.00303079374135,0.00303079374135,0.00265374965966,0.00265260902233,0.00265084533021,0.00265043857507,0.00265043857507,0.00212008273229,0.00206762459129,0.00196655397303,0.00193052145187,0.00192932714708,0.00192932714708,0.0016888830578,0.0016888830578,0.0016888830578,0.0016888830578,0.00168783811387,0.00168589153327,0.00157063885126"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,149357,"I adapted this from a letter to La Superior about this past weekend's experience.Dear Owner/Manager,I wanted to write you about my unfortunate experience at La Superior last Saturday, May 21, 2011. I arrived at La Superior with a friend to grab a late-afternoon post-bike riding snack. We sat down and were excited. We've come quite a few times before (maybe over 10 times?).. I've never had a bad experience except it's too crowded or service is slow or indifferent, but I've only come in the evening. I figured daytime would be even better because it would be less crowded.Our server seemed nice enough, but we weren't really paying attention to how she looked as a person. I stressed to her that I have a dairy allergy, which means no cheese, butter, cream, or dairy of any kind. She brought our first round of tacos, and they were great. We ordered another round, but didn't notice our server had changed by the time we put in our second order. We were too busy laughing and catching up to notice that the gal who served us had changed. I stressed, ""no cheese"" to this server when I ordered the second round, flautas de pollo. They arrived with cream on top, which is not mentioned in the menu (which says, merely, ""crispy rolled corn tortillas, choice of chicken or potatoes with cheese topped with romaine and salsa,"") and I asked the chef who dropped the plate to please bring me one without dairy. I saw him go over to the server and talk to her.Our server came over (second gal). She gave me MAJOR attitude. ""What's the problem?"" she said. ""These have dairy, I wanted ones with no dairy. I don't think the menu said they'd have cream."" ""So what do you want me to do???"" she asked rudely (the tone of voice was confrontational and rude). ""I would like some new ones,"" I said, a bit defiantly. I felt ridiculous that I had to be defiant to be able to eat my food that I was paying for.She took them away without a word, and the air was tense. She went to the back, spoke with the chef. She came back within 30 seconds.""You know, the menu says it has cream,"" she said. I double-checked the hard copy later - it didn't, so maybe there are multiples of the menu??? But at the time, I worried, oh no did I make a mistake? But then I realized that no matter what, I didn't warrant this kind of behavior from her. I felt like I was in an etiquette class where someone was telling me I'd broken every single one of Emily Post's rules, from the way she was uppity with me. But in reality she broke all the etiquette rules, whether it comes to making a restaurant a pleasurable experience or just plain being a nice, decent human being.""You should really let us know beforehand when you can't eat something,"" she said. ""It's not our fault you didn't read the menu. THIS COMES OUT OF OUR WAGES, YOU KNOW. It'll be okay with this one because I worked it out with the chef, but normally this would have come out my wages."" This was said quite incriminatingly, as if to make me feel guilty. I refused to feel guilty. Was she doing me a favor by having ""worked it out with the chef?""""I did tell you before,"" I said. ""I told you I was allergic to dairy the first time I ordered my first tacos.""""No, that must have been the other girl,"" she said. ""BECAUSE WE ALL LOOK THE SAME, YOU KNOW,"" she said loudly and sarcastically. I mean, her voice was dripping with sarcasm. This gal seemed ANGRY, and to be having a bad day. I understand the possibility for that, but there is no excuse for how she acted. To perpetrate bad feelings and meanness upon someone just because you're having a bad day really sucks.I was shocked and blown away. My friend was mortified and had her hand over her face, looking away (she hates confrontation, but I was not about to admit I was at fault here). I widened my eyes and said, ""That doesn't make any sense that it would come out of your wages,"" a bit more upset.""Well, you know, that's what happens when customers do this,"" she said.""That's not my fault,"" I said. I'm pretty sure other people were listening to this conversation. It's bad enough that I don't like feeling noticed or special for not being able to eat dairy. This woman had to go and make me more noticed, more ostracized than I already regularly feel at restaurants, but also didn't give a CRAP if I had an allergic attack.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,57336,"I love this place for a few reasons, affordability, flavor packed food (if you order the right things), and the food comes to the table soon after it's ordered and it's always hot.  I've been there a couple of times now and yes, the decor could use a little more oomph, and presentation could use a little more panache, the style is a bit fast-foodesque but service was friendly and some of the food is so good you'll want to go back for more.  I had the Ezquites, corn cooked with epazote leaves, served with fresh cheese, lime and Mexican mayo. This was okay but i'm a huge fan of grilled corn and that's what i felt this side dish needed was the grilled part. I tried the Salsas, comes with about 5 different little ramekins of salsa from mild to super hot, not chunky style $3 for a fun little rendition of chips and salsa.  I tried two different quesadillas the Tinga de Pollo (fav) super spicy shredded chicken and the Papa con Chorizo (needed more spices to kick it up a notch) each are $3.50 a piece,  come served in a thick closed corn tortilla stuffed with your choice of meat and topped with cheese, sour cream and green sauce.  Then came the tacos that i love.  They are small, $2.50 a piece, but their size makes them easy to eat and you can order a bunch of different kinds.  The Tinga de Pollo is shredded chicken in chipotle tomato sauce, again, super spicy but loaded with taste. The Carnitas taco was the most bland out of all the ones i tried, must add sauce but still decent. The Cochinita Pibil taco is a slow cooked pork in banana leaves, most flavor, very, very rich and soooo good.   The Carne Asada taco has chunks of cubed beef, perfect beefy bites.I want to go back to try some more of the food.  I'm very curious about the Chilaquiles for brunch and theEnchiladas Suizas they looked so good.Overall, I would recommend this place but only to certain people, I can see where some would not like it. The food is served on plastic plates, family style, so you may have to share a plate with your friend or hover your taco over a napkin. That being said, what's missing is all those little things that would make the prices higher. Back to the food, it's authentic, tasty and I love it.  Great spot for a quick cheap good food fix.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,42631,"I lived in California for several years and grew accustomed to good Mexican food.  I always felt that the one thing New York was lacking was good Mexican food.For that reason, I was very excited to try this much hyped spot - especially since it's down the street from my apartment.  I decided to check it out for Sunday brunch.The decor is haphazard and spartan & the light fixture looks kind of dangerous.  But, I didn't expect too much since this place is known for food and not ambiance.I ordered the Huevos de Hacienda and my boyfriend ordered three different kinds of tacos.  We also ordered the salsa sampler and prickly pear Aguas Fresca (freshly squeezed juice).The host was extremely nice, but otherwise service was pretty desultory.  I didn't even get my silverware until after my entree was brought to me.  Also, my boyfriend had finished his three tacos by the time my entree was brought to the table.  There are few things more annoying than watching someone eat when you have nothing in front of you.  The same thing happened to the guys sitting next to us.The salsa sampler has about 6-7 different salsas in itsy-bitsy condiment bowls that are nearly impossible to dip your chip in.  We had to break all our chips in halves and fourths to get a decent portion of salsa.  The freshly made chips were good, but the salsas were bland and not that special.The three tacos that Todd ordered were also quite tiny.  Although the fillings were decent, they didn't come with the usual taco accoutrements (radish, lettuce, peppers, salsa, etc).  He didn't find them filling and felt $2.50 was too much for these bite size bits.My Huevos de Hacienda consisted of refried beans, strips of poblano peppers, eggs over easy, and a huge mound of cheese over a tortilla.  It was quite yummy, but I felt bad for Todd who was still salivating with hunger after eating his teeny tiny tacos.NY Mag hyped up this place to no end - they are losing all kinds of credibility with me - I was pretty disappointed with this place (and others that they've recommended).Overall, the food is okay - I might come back.  But, I'll probably get takeout so that I don't have to watch my date eat and vice versa.  If you do visit this place, come for dinner- I don't recommend the brunch here.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.300000011921,9.89999961853,"thing,entree,food,boyfriend,Todd,spot,Mexican,food.,California,street,apartment,reason,thing,condiment bowls,New York,tacos,NY Mag,place,food,place,decor,kinds,salsas,salsas,tacos,tacos,others,light fixture,salsa,salsa sampler,silverware,service,host,things,portion,salsa sampler,chip,chips,Huevos de Hacienda,juice,pear,table,front,nothing,someone,guys,tacos.,place,halves,fourths,place,eat,food,kinds,tortilla,credibility,end,hunger,takeout,Aguas Fresca,chips,vice versa,dinner,salsa,brunch,fillings,peppers,poblano peppers,bite size,taco accoutrements,radish,lettuce,cheese,mound,eggs,strips,refried beans,bits.My Huevos de Hacienda","7,1,7,1,1,7,2,1,2,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.108518563211,0.0755052119493,0.0699810385704,0.0597159564495,0.0411978289485,0.0410868860781,0.03975218907,0.0357004478574,0.0308961886913,0.0248292833567,0.0248292833567,0.0248292833567,0.0152717586607,0.015038668178,0.0147278420627,0.0135178789496,0.0131200086325,0.0129836471751,0.0127311320975,0.0127311320975,0.0115733342245,0.0107616772875,0.00958147644997,0.00950840953737,0.0091074090451,0.00906675402075,0.00901504233479,0.00898485723883,0.00869033671916,0.0085892053321,0.00815084017813,0.00757185788825,0.00757185788825,0.00743423216045,0.00741120008752,0.00724736787379,0.00723745534196,0.00722780218348,0.00637472001836,0.00634131161496,0.00634131161496,0.00631433539093,0.0063036615029,0.0063036615029,0.0063036615029,0.00629426166415,0.00614626612514,0.00578795885667,0.00575234461576,0.00575234461576,0.00522110145539,0.00504169240594,0.00490881269798,0.00489133223891,0.00428354647011,0.00427952408791,0.00427952408791,0.00427952408791,0.00381475361064,0.00375468772836,0.00312748225406,0.00296032661572,0.00295790517703,0.00284242955968,0.00260563194752,0.00248580891639,0.00214961520396,0.00214743427932,0.00195154000539,0.00188058777712,0.00188058777712,0.00188058777712,0.00187867961358,0.00187867961358,0.00187867961358,0.00187867961358,0.00187867961358,0.00127097743098"

They're delicious, good quality food, but way overpriced. Go if you want but be warned as I was not warned.

The flautas de pollo were also excellent - they were crispy outside and soft inside just as they should be. Those two appetizers were a great way to start the meal.It was all about the tacos from there on out. The carnitas taco was amazing, full of flavor. The tinga de pollo almost ended my career. I know why people like this so much, but my stomach, mouth and tongue do not have this much resistance in them to withstand another taste of these chicken tacos ever again. It was the spiciest taco I have ever had and while I appreciated it, I almost died and drank 10 glasses of water and a coke which did nothing.This is a real Mexican restaurant and I can't wait to go back again and avoid the chicken taco because everything else I had was seriously amazing.",4.0 star rating,"Montclair, NJ",2,1,0.300000011921,5.40000009537,"vibe,anything,food,Mexican,taco,California,New York,coke,place,menu,everything,carnitas taco,measure,touch,tacos,morsel,chips,chip,stuff,guac,meal,way,corner,flautas,chicken tacos,flavor,tinga,W'burg,people,guacamole,water,glasses,chicken taco,everything,meal.It,restaurant,chips,appetizers,career,resistance,taste,tongue,mouth,stomach","1,7,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.164297476411,0.09219391644,0.09219391644,0.0720510035753,0.0580910108984,0.0551105551422,0.0551105551422,0.0314127393067,0.0207408778369,0.0206657238305,0.0192900989205,0.0177317988127,0.0170342605561,0.0170342605561,0.0148823438212,0.0146532496437,0.0142914075404,0.0142914075404,0.0139307780191,0.0130018973723,0.0130018973723,0.0123795717955,0.0113789299503,0.0113527160138,0.0110765136778,0.0103527540341,0.0103373359889,0.0100986026227,0.00862590037286,0.00806129164994,0.00770659372211,0.00770659372211,0.00766415521502,0.0072835884057,0.0070210644044,0.00662003317848,0.0062163816765,0.0049123801291,0.00339056830853,0.00338604254648,0.00338604254648,0.00338604254648,0.00338604254648,0.00325967930257"

If you're looking for cheap, mouth watering street food, hit the taco trucks in Jackson Heights/Elmhurst because La Superior isn't it. With that said, La Superior did do right by my stomach and taste buds with the verdura soup (aromatic chicken broth with corn kernels, poblano, Chayote squash mexican zuchinni and mexican herbs.) It came with garnishes on the side, which I love. But everything was placed on a huge plate, which I normally wouldn't mind if I hadn't ordered so much or if the table wasn't so small. It's a huge bowl and I couldn't finish it but I definitely tried. I kept saying, ""okay, I'm done"" but I kept drinking it because it was that refreshing. The ezquite is pretty amazing too. The corn kernels are cooked with epazote leaves and served with fresh cheese, lime and Mexican mayo. Everything is placed in a plastic cup and you use the bowl and spoons they provide you with the mix it up. I personally love it when food is interactive so I enjoyed the entire process a great deal.The next table ordered queso fundido (melted Chihuahua cheese served with corn tortillas choice of mushrooms or chorizo). My mouth was watering just looking at it, definitely trying it the next time I go.It's also worth mentioning that the watermelon juice is fresh as is the guacamole.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,60437,"Sweet Jesus do I love La Superior. I always start out with a large classic margarita and guacamole. If I'm gonna have a margarita, I might as well have two in one glass, and while the flavored ones are great, I personally prefer a traditional margarita, and this one is tart in just the way I like. The guac is delicious, with just the right amount of heat on the palate. The Chorizo Toluqueno taco and Camaron Chipotle taco are two of my favorites in terms of the tacos, and the Rajas taco is also a must try. Granted, the first two tacos I listed are spicy (particularly the chipotle), but if you're like me, that's a very good thing. A note on people who bitch here about the service at La Superior. I've never had bad service there. Not once. Part of this is because I'm very nice to servers. Service is kind of a two way street. You get a lot more with sugar, and I can honestly tell you I've had booze taken off at plenty of places just because I was being nice and polite to the waitstaff. If you've never waited tables, it's not a fun job, and having a bunch of demanding dickheads treat you like a robot doesn't make it any easier.

Was squired here for a Euro-style din (read: after 530p, which is when I usually eat din if not trapped in the hospital) - immediately greeted by Offspring's ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"", so knew shizz was abt to get real - settled in for margs, tacos, and eyeing the couples around us that we'd probs see out in an hour.Vibe is kind of what I'd expect a resto that opened in a double wide trailer to look like - or, if Walking Dead was real and there was somehow an abandoned kitchen sitch that magically was flush w queso fresco and masa started pumping out Mexican street fare while avoiding getting taken over my zombies - you know, totally normal - that's a long way of saying that it ain't fancy, but it has dirty charm in its own way. Service is fairly absent/not thrilled to be there, though there is the occasional bright spot if you're a regular, which JBH is - started w classic margs - could have been stronger/lime-ier, though as I have the tolerance of a 12y/o who steals her parent's vodka once a month and feels like a bad ass, obs two got me a little tips. Moved on to blistered shishitos - with a sprinkle of salt and a kiss of lime, perfection - my camarones con chipotle taco was kicking - appropriately firey but not overwhelming - and the rajas is a creamy treat - the pescado w pico also got high marks - didn't hit the pork brain quesadilla, though apparently that's an option, as is slow cooked pork in nana leaves, jalapenos rellenos, gorditas con chorizo, and flautas to name a few - but did dive into a street quesadilla, which was a crispy little packet of rajas swimming in a mountain of queso - not a dieter's delight, but whatever, let your hair down once in a while.Cash only so roll w/ your dollar bills - though it's hella cheap - tacos are $2.5/each, larger plates $8-13, quesadillas $3.5 - and idk how much drinks are, but they can't be that absurd, I'm guessing $7-12.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,114694,"When I walk into a Mexican restaurant my first question always is: is it Mexican owned?  This is how I know how high to set the standards. As I walked into La Superior with my friend ""Mafalda"" (self-appointed sidekick for my Mexican food rendezvous in NYC), she informed me that the restaurant IS Mexican owned.  I suspected from the menu. They have very authentic dishes listed on there; for example, ""gorditas"", an almost strictly Mexican street/rural food made with simple ingredients such as maize dough, beef, cheese and salsa. I was surprised to see them on there.  They also have ""cochinita pibil"" tacos, and ""mezquites""--all dishes that are, otherwise, hard to find.  Additional indicators of authenticity were their beverages, ""Aguas frescas"", which I unfortunately was not able to try this time around. To start us off, I ordered a ""margarita de tamarindo"" (tamarind margarita--margaritas are my favorite drink). It was excellent! Flavorful with a dash of spice. It wasn't too strong, which is perfect for me, as I prefer to not taste too much alcohol in my beverages. Then we ordered a ""gordita de lengua"" (beef tongue), a mushroom quesadilla, and a taco with ""chorizo and papas"" (sausage and potatoes) and another one with ""asada"" (grilled beef). The tacos were great, the ""asada"" taco was excellent, by far my favorite dish of the night.  The mushroom quesadilla was also good, although I prefer it not fried, and the gordita would have been great had the ""masa"" (maize corn dough) been fully cooked.  The beef tongue, however, was well done, and flavorful.  Finally, the sauces were as good as it will get in any Mexican restaurant (almost as good as my mother's). The place is tiny and casual, which I prefer. It's the type of place where you can just walk in dressed in your shorts, top and sandals (although I live in Williamsburg, I'm not a hipster, nor do I pay too much attention to they way people around me dress--whom were all hipsters).  The place was packed, but we were lucky enough to find space at the bar.  The bar tender was friendly and accommodating. I had originally asked for a Corona, which he had already opened when I saw the margarita menu and changed my mind. He cheerfully accepted to change my order without charging me for the beer (thank you awesome bar tender whose name I forgot to ask!) :)  Service was moderately fast, and ambiance was enjoyable. And all for a relatively good price! Tacos are $2.50 a piece and the margarita was $6 bucks, which is not bad for New York!  The gordita is a bit over-priced ($5), but it's filling, and I guess you're paying for the unique experience.Other things to note: they only accept CASH, which in a 21st century world is still difficult for me to fathom.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,4879,"This time was my third time in La Superior. The tacos here are pretty good for the most part.  I was here in a group of 5 on a Saturday night and we had to wait almost an hour for the table.  The good thing is we were able to eat some tacos and guac at the bar while we waited. The drinks were really good. I had a margarita while a couple of my friends had the guava margarita. They were both somewhat strong, smooth and not too sugary. The waiting and the standing around made us really hungry so we tried a lot of stuff. Here is how I'd rate them:Guac: Loved the lightly fried chips and the fresh guac with plenty of citrus. 4/5Camaron al chipotle: The chipotle sauce is spicy. If you add a bit of their hot sauce, it takes the spiciness to a another level. The shrimp is cooked perfectly. 4/5Chorizo: Lacked a little bit of flavor. Personally I don't like it when you ground up the chorizo so much. I like it chunkier and as it holds more fat (and that usually means more flavor) 3.5/5Carnitas: A lot of porky flavor and nice crunch. Probably my favorite of the tacos. 4/5Carne Asada: This is the most talked about taco on yelp... and its absolutely nothing special. 3/5Lengua: Not bad, but I've had better in Queens and it unnecessarily comes with a hefty $3.50 price tag. 3.5/5Fried fish taco: I forget the exact name of this but it was the most forgettable thing I had that night as the fish was totally bland. 2.5/5Steak Tinga Quesadilla: Their quesadillas are nothing like what you would see in most places. They are more like a large sized empanada with a heap of cotija cheese on top. If the tacos don't fill you up, this most certainly will. 4/5Octopus Tostada: This was one of the specials for the night. The tostada was only slightly bigger than the tacos but they gave quite a generous portion of octopus. It melted like chocolate in my mouth. 4.5/5On a side note, I've had their pig brain taco which I don't think they offer anymore but they do have it in one of their quesadillas. I've no qualms about eating brains but theirs didn't taste fresh.It's a fun place to come to with a couple of friends but the space is limited so worth keeping that in mind during peak hours.",4.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,14.0,"tacos,5Carnitas,tacos,thing,thing,La Superior,guac,part,group,table,bar,taco,5Lengua,pig brain taco,favorite,place,couple,guava margarita,friends,margarita,lot,waiting,fish taco,stuff,standing,chipotle sauce,chips,Guac,guac,chipotle,flavor,flavor,qualms,spiciness,bit,hot sauce,bit,tacos,nothing,plenty,level,shrimp,crunch,tostada,yelp,price tag,one,chorizo,specials,octopus,portion,mouth,chocolate,side note,drinks,5Chorizo,quesadillas,space,5Carne Asada,Queens,one,couple,friends,brains,nothing,fresh.,mind,5Octopus Tostada,fish,quesadillas,tacos,places,top,cotija cheese,heap,empanada,5Steak Tinga Quesadilla","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,1,2,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7","0.0507007464767,0.0493913665414,0.0480272136629,0.0472631417215,0.0432864129543,0.0388879925013,0.0388811528683,0.0312488880008,0.0310894083232,0.0310894083232,0.0309767462313,0.0300485994667,0.0294771939516,0.0292865782976,0.0227283537388,0.0186446476728,0.0143520506099,0.0134718706831,0.0134718706831,0.0134718706831,0.0129226790741,0.0123559618369,0.0117982486263,0.0117457425222,0.0117457425222,0.0110844923183,0.0103360014036,0.00995061453432,0.00995061453432,0.00995061453432,0.0099144205451,0.00989508070052,0.00943049509078,0.00920749735087,0.00903900060803,0.00903900060803,0.00901814643294,0.00878781359643,0.00822949036956,0.00791939813644,0.00790883321315,0.00789928715676,0.00787518545985,0.00730695575476,0.00720040872693,0.00719452183694,0.0065231337212,0.00581526290625,0.00535669876263,0.00535354064777,0.00535354064777,0.00535052502528,0.00535052502528,0.00534763885662,0.00512000080198,0.00467179622501,0.00465283263475,0.00453273067251,0.00426295073703,0.00425946386531,0.00423185480759,0.00422966526821,0.00422966526821,0.00412375247106,0.00408879062161,0.0037004260812,0.0037004260812,0.00362453819253,0.00321567780338,0.00277655269019,0.00277580716647,0.00269058858976,0.00235223351046,0.00235223351046,0.00235223351046,0.00235223351046,0.00175091845449"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,11324,"""Want to join us for lunch?"" my friend said.""Ugh, I can't spend any more money this week. Or eat beyond the bare minimum.""""It's Cinco de Mayo, man. We're going to La Superior.""""...dammit.""Minutes later, several convives... and I... were making our way down sun-baked sidewalks in Williamsburg, transitioning from hipster central to more run-down territory along the way. But it was somehow appropriate. When we came upon the aggressively unassuming storefront, the smile on the face of the Arizona Mexican among us said it all: this could be the real thing.Was it? I'm not really qualified to say. What I can say is that I had a very satisfying lunch there. I exercised a huge amount of restraint in ordering -- for me, this means two tacos and splitting a torta with someone.My carnitas taco was a thing of beauty. Labeled ""pork confit"" on the menu, what it really is is pork fried in its own fat, which, I think we all can agree, is a recipe for deliciousness. But I've had some questionable carnitas at ostensibly authentic taco stands before. Luckily, La Superior's did not disappoint. Just the right touch of crunch and crust from the frying surrounded tender, juicy meat. It was a generous portion of pork, too, on the single tortilla. I guess double tortillas are more authentic, but I didn't miss the second one (though I suppose some would say that, all by itself, not wishing for another tortilla is a fatal blow against the place).I was less enamored of a lengua taco, which was sadly overcooked. Perhaps if the pieces had been cut bigger, I would not have been robbed of the singular sensation of truly tender tongue on my own. Still, it was tasty, so not a total bust.The torta brought me back to happiness. Although not a large sandwich for its $8 price, the cochinita we chose as filling was gorgeously tender, a result of the pork's long marination in a heavily citrused sauce. Not sure how authentic a sourdough baguette is in a torta, but it did a fine job of absorbing all the juices being expressed from the meat. And the tomato/onion/avocado toppings contributed a much-appreciated coolness to the sandwich.It's tough to give this one 4 stars. I mean, they serve Mexican Coke! If only they'd nailed the lengua taco, I'd be tempted for 5. But that's a bit too grave a misstep for me. Still, a more than worthy addition to the NYC taco scene.

I ordered another and the chicken was kind of dry, but by then I had drinks so I didn't care as much.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,30970,"So I have been trying to get into this place for over a month now. I accidentally stumbled into it on my way to brunch at Randolphs. Since then each time I try there is a huge mob outside waiting to be seated. Sometimes your just not in the mood to wait. Well yesterday I tried on off beat hour. Not necessarily dinner but way past lunch time already. There was still a crowd waiting outside. But not as large like usual. I proceeded to walk in and saw a 6-8 seater bar. It was full. I asked the host how long for the wait. She immediately asked those folks hoggin bar stools to leave. Apparently they were only waiting for a table. Score! Finally I made into this place. There is a large menu up ahead with all the tacos they offer and on the side the margarita list. The bartender was a gentleman with a real grunge rocker look. Long black beard and all. Pretty interesting. He then passed me two menus. One was the alcohol menu and the other a much nicer version with details on the food. I am big fan on tacos. So if this place was going to pass the test I needed to order my favorite type of taco. Great news they did offer them - carnitas taco. I ordered 3. From frequenting other Mexican places I normally eat 2 and take the 3rd home. So I stuck to my usual plan. I was a little overwhelmed with the margarita selection. There was only 5 or 6 different kinds. But this was an important decision. I wanted to try the best one. Upon reading the descriptions I noticed they like to put spicy this or that into most of them. I am not a fan of spicy margaritas. I like mine classic or fruity but must be strong. I ended up selecting the tamarind margarita. I was worried I have to be honest. I didn't know what to expect. They give you the option of small or large. Of course I opted for the large... Woohoo!! I must say if I had to pick between what I liked more the food or the margarita..... Hands down the margarita wins. It was the right amount of everything. I saw the bartender mix it up and had tons of stuff to it. But once it hits your mouth it's a sweet with a little tangy spice flavor to it. It was just amazing. Big kuddos to the bartender on his mixology abilities. Moving on to the tacos, I was a little surprised that they were smaller than the norm. That's why they lost a star. The tortilla itself was smaller. They were completely filled with meat and slight garnishing of Picadillo and onions. Served with a side of semi spicy sauce and lemon wedges. They tasted pretty good but I have to be honest I have had better. The carnitas were seasoned but not as intense and flavorful as I would have liked them. I also felt that since their tacos are much smaller than usual they can't add all the extra that normally come with. For example lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream. I missed those things on my taco. Because they were smaller I ate all 3 and still had room for a 4th. So I decided to try the carne Asada. This meat had so much more flavor than the carnitas. The beef was also cooked to perfection. It was juicy and tender. This place is loud so if you are looking for a restaurant to talk or hate loud alternative, rocker type music this is not your cup of tea. Parking is easy in comparison to other areas in Williamsburg. It's in an off area where this is one of the few restaurants around.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,194341,"The prevalence of 5 star reviews on here for this place is astounding to me.  The food is bland, and overpriced.  The service is lousy, and they dont even have alcohol.  It stinks.  First of all, I have realistic expectations of Mexican food in NY.  There are very few places here that serve authentic Mexican food to a standard that can be found on the west coast. I have no idea why that is, as I'm sure the same ingredients are available here and there are plenty of talented Mexican cooks in the city. However things have definitely improved in NY regarding Mexican cuisine, and there are quite a few spots that serve a decent taco.  This is not one of them.  The food was totally bland, and lacking in any real fire or flavor.  The meats were under-seasoned and dry.    And they are without doubt the smallest, saddest looking taco's I have ever seen.  You know how when you buy a taco from a taco truck you usually get 2 soft tortillas?  Here, you get one which disintegrates immediately upon soaking up all of the the excess oil.  They're even cheap with the cilantro, which is pretty bad for a taco place.  I mean - with the tacos hovering around the 3 dollar mark, is there really a need to be so cheap when it comes to basics like tortillas and cilantro???You know, a place like this might be halfway okay if they even had beer on the menu - after all, everything goes better with booze - but no, you have to suffer through your mediocre, overpriced food sober.  That's strike two.You can get a much better taco for half the price by visiting the many food trucks which line Roosevelt avenue between Woodside 61st St and Roosevelt Ave on the 7 train.  Any of the taco trucks along there serve 2-dollar tacos that blow anything on La Superiors menu out of the water.  With that kind of competition nearby, I cannot fathom how this place is always packed.  I guess some people just dont want to travel out of Williamsburg which is a shame, because they're really missing out.Since this place doesnt boast good food, decent service (it was horribly, horribly slow the night I was there, and the staff didn't seem to have a clue about their own menu), or even cold beers, I cannot see what the logic would be for coming here.  The only difference is that when you dine at La Superior you are having your food served to you by some bearded straight-out-of-central casting Williamsburg hipster.  For me, the beards, non-prescription glasses and lumberjack shirts are no incentive, so that's strike three.  Pass.",1.0 star rating,"Woodside, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,13.1000003815,"places,star reviews,place,Mexican,prevalence,place,food,food,food,spots,service,idea,all,people,alcohol,expectations,standard,one,cilantro,NY,incentive,Williamsburg,taco,taco,taco,taco,food,cuisine,tacos,place,taco place,food,west coast,city,cooks,things,tortillas,everything,one,ingredients,plenty,tacos,food,taco truck,food trucks,need,all,tortillas,cilantro,food,beer,fire,flavor,doubt,oil,basics,dollar mark,booze,strike two.,price,menu,shame,service,beers,staff,clue,logic,difference,hipster,casting,glasses,lumberjack shirts,beards,meats,menu,taco trucks,La Superior,train,water,anything,competition,kind,Roosevelt,La Superiors,avenue,Roosevelt Ave,Woodside 61st St","2,5,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,1,7,6,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,3","0.100924909115,0.0928192287683,0.0555887967348,0.0454765930772,0.0451788455248,0.0372417494655,0.0353340953588,0.0299683418125,0.0285624247044,0.0258997604251,0.0245392583311,0.0206762161106,0.0199265964329,0.0183135326952,0.0175565890968,0.0174437053502,0.0169278625399,0.0166511014104,0.0158168729395,0.0155062759295,0.0147068221122,0.0140897063538,0.0118454284966,0.0114904688671,0.00902588665485,0.0088821509853,0.00874728616327,0.00832772534341,0.00754005275667,0.00751398038119,0.00671005202457,0.00666513014585,0.00665457034484,0.00664159096777,0.00664159096777,0.00663036759943,0.00655161216855,0.00648969179019,0.00633677467704,0.00623401021585,0.00623401021585,0.00605548266321,0.00563371181488,0.0055907224305,0.00555802835152,0.00543501414359,0.00508044892922,0.00507186027244,0.00507186027244,0.00496633956209,0.00464134523645,0.00446411874145,0.00446411874145,0.00445381551981,0.00444512302056,0.00443760724738,0.00443760724738,0.00406086910516,0.0040577496402,0.0040577496402,0.00380178028718,0.00375285581686,0.00345787662081,0.00345787662081,0.0031826638151,0.00302528799511,0.00256556062959,0.00256397388875,0.00209313980304,0.00209313980304,0.00209190533496,0.00209190533496,0.00196337723173,0.00193110492546,0.00166964996606,0.00166964996606,0.0014161268482,0.00132943619974,0.00132847274654,0.00132847274654,0.00132756191306,0.00132756191306,0.000899376755115,0.00089872488752,0.000863690045662,0.000786792719737,0.000786792719737"
La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,29378,"La Superior is one of the quintessential Williamsburg restaurants for me- hipster service, cheap food with fresh (and quirky) ingredients accompanied by strong drinks, in a grungy environment. Hipster service: I've been here several times and I've had the same server at least thrice. He was charming, standoffish, and mildly disapproving. Once I was served by an intoxicated waitress who almost charmed my friend and me into eating a dessert that we didn't want. On my most recent visit to La Superior I was confronted with the bad news of an intimidatingly long wait-time, delivered by a grouchy host. Overall positive experiences, just don't expect to be fawned over.Cheap food with fresh (and quirky) ingredients + strong drinks: The tacos are variably delicious. The carne asada taco was so-so (I won't order it again) but the rajas taco was perfect and I'm a fan of the ezquites. There are a few dishes that you won't find in your run of the mill Mexican joint (beef tongue, pigs feet), but I'm not culturally savvy enough to comment on the Authenticity of the menu.  The margaritas were strong and sour. Nuff said.Grungy environment: It's a tiny place with a few bar stools and seating for maybe 20?

He made sure the beers we brought were kept chilled, and he gave us some free food to sample to make our experience complete. He was above and beyond what I expect from any server/manager/owner in a restaurant. He showed great pride and enthusiasm in the establishment and made sure that we had great food and a great time.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,41467,So after reading many reviews for La Superior my fiancee & I decided to give it a shot. I went there with an open mind being from California I knew off hand that this place wouldn't compare to anything back home. We were handed the menu which didn't have to many choices so I stuck to something I thought they wouldn't mess up the Tacos de Carne Azada boy was I wrong....... When we ordered we specifically stated we wanted the meat well done but when I got my tacos the meat was raw my tortilla was covered with blood... Disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!! To top it off the size of the taco were so small it was literally a child's portion which was insulting. As I proceeded to complain to the waitress she gave me the only attitude when I expressed my dissatisfaction with my order. The waitress proceeded to tell the other wait staff as if by her doing so I was going to change my mind about the bloody plate of tacos I was served... The VERY RUDE waitress also had the nerve to tell me that they don't cook the meat for the dish I ordered they only cook the meat for other dishes.....( WTF) if that was the case they should of mentioned it in the beginning when taking my order I would of walked out. This place seems to only cater to the Williamsburg people and what made me realize this was our order was up and the waiter kept walking passed it serving what appeared to be were the folks from Williamsburg.... If you know what REAL MEXICAN FOOD is all about I would suggest you stay away from this dump... No offense to the cooks who are MEXICAN....

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,829,"Perhaps this place starts to makes sense once you've taken advantage of the drinks menu. However, much as I've tried (I am nothing if not persistent when it comes to food and giving popular restaurants their due) I cannot understand the abundance of overly favorable Yelp reviews for La Superior. The place itself has a great atmosphere (though it can become cramped) and I can imagine that if you're in the market for a drink and a taco before a show, you could probably do much worse. However, my primary interest in life is food and so we will restrict our review to said realm. I am one of those rare individuals who enjoys soup and so, upon seeing the black bean soup on the menu, I thought we were in business. That, as it happens, was premature for the soup was absolutely flavorless. Confronted with such a bleak situation, I appealed to the little bowls of cheese and tortillas that accompanied the dish in the hope that there would be salvation. It wasn't to be. It is certainly a hearty and rich dish but then again so too is Ensure and no one is lining up to get in on that dietary supplement action. Not one to give up on a restaurant based on a single negative experience, I returned to dabble in the torta ahogada, which is essentially sourdough bread stuffed with carnitas. How wrong can one go? Unfortunately, yet again, this was not exactly the most exciting of dishes and the requisite seasoning was wholly absent. Strike two. When a friend moved to the area and informed me that this is where we would be meeting, as he just had to try it, I considered ending the friendship. However, masochist that I am, I tagged along: he went for the gorditas and a collection of other tacos, which, I must admit, he thought were decent but unexceptional. The service at the place also seems to vary greatly from friendly and welcoming on some occasions, to the area standard of doing you a huge favor by granting you entry into the establishment at all.Conclusion: If you're in the mood for a quick taco and a drink, this may be the place however, if you're simply in the market for a good meal, this is not the solution by any stretch of the imagination.",2.0 star rating,"Williamsburg, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,7.59999990463,"nothing,place,restaurants,advantage,drinks menu,interest,friend,sense,place,reviews,food,abundance,individuals,Yelp,La Superior,torta ahogada,drink,taco,bowls,collection,market,service,dish,atmosphere,show,life,black bean soup,soup,dish,soup,salvation,menu,tortillas,review,restaurant,realm,business,hope,situation,cheese,one,place,supplement action,bread,carnitas,experience,tacos,place,entry,gorditas,occasions,area standard,favor,drink,taco,solution,market,establishment,imagination,stretch,meal,mood,dishes,seasoning,area,friendship,exciting,Strike,masochist","7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,4,7","0.173456475139,0.0870784074068,0.0637177526951,0.0537417493761,0.0527719892561,0.0427882410586,0.042645778507,0.0359968617558,0.0344621166587,0.0252647157758,0.0252647157758,0.0221219696105,0.0202246438712,0.0131252165884,0.0131252165884,0.0130501771346,0.0105819832534,0.0105819832534,0.0100517207757,0.00970651116222,0.00962654594332,0.00945623032749,0.00874174293131,0.00842421781272,0.00842421781272,0.00839359778911,0.00710173230618,0.00708535593003,0.00707153929397,0.00701237283647,0.00689279008657,0.00645992485806,0.00643245503306,0.0060041421093,0.00586015591398,0.00566843990237,0.00565243931487,0.00562839768827,0.00562839768827,0.00562839768827,0.00561050698161,0.00515054771677,0.00513437669724,0.00512752775103,0.00512752775103,0.00512752775103,0.00478942459449,0.00436831219122,0.00432295817882,0.00381148792803,0.00380837125704,0.00380837125704,0.00380837125704,0.00331363384612,0.00331363384612,0.00327098788694,0.00301386532374,0.00263679982163,0.00263679982163,0.00263679982163,0.00263679982163,0.00263679982163,0.00210696295835,0.00200219778344,0.00191255216487,0.00191255216487,0.00167647865601,0.00167477771174,0.00167174090166"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,170796,"I used to go here fairly often but stopped because of how insultingly bad the service is. I'm fine with surly waiters but not ones who snipe at me for shit I didn't do or instigate arguments over what I ordered.Worst offender is the bearded, dark-haired white guy who's always around (maybe he owns the place?). Once I showed up with about five people, saw that several tables by the door were free, and asked if it'd be cool if we sat at them. He said yes and told us to sit there, so we sat. A few minutes later, after we were ensconced, he came over and bitchily told us we shouldn't have just sat down and should have asked him first (you know, like we actually did), because other people needed one of the tables.The place is spotty about actually serving you what you order, too. Once another server handed me some taco that didn't look like anything I'd ordered, and when I told him I didn't we think we'd ordered it, he huffily asked if we even knew what we'd ordered and insisted he was right.Another time, when an item I HAD ordered never came to the table, I asked the bearded guy its status. He preachily explained that at La Superior, the food comes out when it's ready, because it's street food, be patient, etc., etc. -- but never brought out the ordered item at all. At La Superior, you see, the food comes out only when the blowhard serving it wants to, because it's street food, authentic street food, and accordingly no effort will be made to make you any more comfortable than you would be standing on the corner of Berry and South 2nd devouring that tiny taco. (Maybe this explains the place's well-documented lack of heat. Tip on that front: Spend a while warming up in the bathroom, which is gloriously warm.)Some of the dishes at La Superior are very, very fresh and well-executed: The gorditas, the cochinitas, the rajas that fills a taco and quesadilla. Skip the beans and esquites; a can of corn or beans eaten straight would be less watery and bland. All the seafood dishes I've had there have the funky, muddy taste of farmed white fish, which makes me question how La Superior sources its ingredients. The tacos are lackluster (thanks to their size and their rubbery tortillas), as is the vegetable soup, but the bean soup's very hearty and flavorful. The quesadillas are pretty good, but their cooks have a seriously heavy hand with the crema and requeson.This place has been hugely successful since it opened and has gotten great press, so I can't imagine what makes its staff so bratty -- except maybe its lack of a liquor license.

Que bueno!  No pare, sigue sigue!!! After many years of living within 10 miles of our neighbors to the South, I was excited to taste some excellent Mexican fare tonight, celebrate my friend's birthday, relax, and savor the experience.No such luck.  I have had friendlier and better service at a Tijuana taco stand.  1) If the table seats N people, they will attempt to seat N+1.  My group, there to celebrate a birthday, had 5 people in it.  We were seated at a table that fit 4 comfortably.  Thankfully, we were all easy going types with good hygiene.  The table next to us, which seats 2, had 3 people crammed in.  The table on the other side, which seats 5 comfortably, had 6.  So, in a space that should accommodate 11 people, we had 14.  I had to do some Cirque du Soleil stuff to avoid putting my posterior on someone else's table while I slid in in between tables to get to the booth.   Don't make me call the Fire Marshal...2) The Long Wait.  You will hear about the The Long Wait after you have experienced The Long Wait.   The Long Wait will accompany every taco you are served, every glass of water you request, every gordita that you nibble.  It's like punctuation at the end of every server's sentence.  It's the air that the servers breathe.  ""Yes, two carnitas, and by the way, you know... The Long Wait.""  ""We have a heavy demand for this table and... well...

My first time at La Superior I was pretty convinced it was going to be a mere blip on my radar. I ordered the carne asada taco and then a spicier taco con pollo. I asked the waiter if I could please have a little shredded cheese on the side for my tacos. He apologized and said, ""Sorry, can't do that."" I laughed and said, ""You're kidding, right?"" He answered with a slight laugh but still with a firm negative response.. He left. I was confused. Was I going to get cheese or not? Long story short, I'm the idiot that thought he was kidding about the cheese- he wasn't. But, as #4 above mentioned-- none of that matters. no booze, no cards, no cheese-- no problem!

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,85274,"If you want a cheap taco, go to Mexico and get one from a shack on wheels off the side of the road. This is New York people! Of course you're going to pay New York prices. Be realistic.On to the food - We started with the black bean soup and although it was a bit watery (bb soup should have texture) it was packed with flavor. Add all of the sides such as the tortilla slices, the sour cream and especially the dried peppers for a smokey subtlety. TACOS!! Yes. Tacos. Order one of each if you dare. My choice favorite was the carne asada. The steak was cooked to perfection. Add a little lime juice and green salsa and you've achieved nirvana. I LOVE MEAT! But, I can be pleased with a vegetarian delight from time to time. A sauteed mushroom taco didn't make sense to me at first but the Hongos hit the spot with my flare for the unusual. I LOVE GARLIC! And so speaking of spice, I wasn't expecting it in the Camaron tacos, but I took it like a champ. I'll order shimp tacos anywhere I'll go. They're an indicator of a solid restaurant and these didn't disappoint. Get your water refilled before that first bite though. Their chipotle packs a punch. I LOVE SPICY! As for the others, the chicken and pork tacos were as you would expect. Tasty and acceptable.A note about the service: I guess I was lucky having accompanied a native Mexican and reoccurring patron to La Superior. We did receive the above average service from the wait staff because of this, so it's hard to offer the unbiased opinion on the matter. (Ordering in a foreign language is sexy by the way.)FRIGID COLD IN THERE!Oh, and right.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,34075,"Ok, You're in Williamsburg. You want Mexican Deliciousness. La Superior has, pretty universally, the best mexican in the borough. I'm from Queens (in a Latin Neighborhood), and I""d consider the trip down there JUST FOR THE TACOS!!!!!Anyway, most of the complaints here center around the service. This is a small (seats 30-40), hip mexican joint in Brooklyn. They're busy, they have a wait for tables, and the staff wants you to leave after you're done eating. I know a number of reviews have said that service wasn't good, but in my case, it's been fine. Not great, but totally acceptable. Drinks : The Paloma is basically a margarita with grapefruit soda (SUGAR sweetened Squirt). The Margaritas are delicious, with just a dash of spice to them, and they have $4 mexican beers. Seriously, how do you go wrong with that????The Food :We had a few quesadillas, and the corn appetizer. The Pork Brain is delicious. I know, It's pork brain, but still, ever had sweetbreads? The texture is marvelous, and the flavor is similar. It's REALLY good. Also, the fish quesedilla on special was lovely. It came with a smoked chile sauce that was phenomenal and hot, but not in the way you'd ususally expect.On to the Tacos :Shrimp. Oh My God the shrimp and smoky chile sauce are having an orgy in my mouth. That good. Give it a healthy dose of lime to add a bit of acid, and you've got one heck of a wonderful taco.Peppers and onions in cream sauce : Wonderful, again. Well seasoned, mild, and cuts the heat from everything else. Al Pastor : The best vinegar-based marinated pork I've ever had, hands down. This was delicious, and smothered in a heaping pile of fresh tomato/onion salsa.Lengua : This is what all tongue meat should taste like. Delicate, well seasoned, tender, juicy, nothing whatsoever in terms of my usual complaints (tough, dry, chewy).

Apparently, Superior was named really for the 'smug, superior' attitude that comes for free and not in a good way.....We went on last Friday with good expectations of good food, decent prices, bite sized portions and a good casual eating place. Food, portions etc all on par with expectations- check.Our Mexican ( i asked) waiter was just lovely and so accommodating and polite and warm.""Psycho doucebag"" - ALERT!Superior is the ULTIMATE faux taqueria - smacks of blatant nastiness and slightly racist comments  to us by the the 'aforementioned' douche bag black bearded man (from several other reviews) last night to my Cuban friend, my Indian friend and I.  I think 6 people on two occasions can't be wrong about this guy upon hearing his nasty little under the breath comments. He went out of his way to pleasant, solicitous to the rest of the tables. First time we went, he was specifically unpleasant and said some uncalled things was last Friday and we thought, maybe it was an off day for him so like fools with our money, we came back last night. Same nastiness - he deliberately poured water over my friends pants! said some nasty things under this breath   and finally, told us ""this is a REAL Mexican taco stand"" and we knew nothing and was an ass.  Of course, his poor workers  behind the wallpapered kitchen were watching this one way exchange of unpleasantness directed to us. Poor guys that work there - imagine how nasty he was to us, how does he treat his workers?  Worse than slaves? See for yourself- look at the eyes of the kitchen staff- the pretty wallpapered kitchen does not hide their true feelings about this fella.DO  NOT GO THERE! food- you need to spend at least $15-20 person to feel full which is ok. But, the nasty little fella is too much! he's the owner's friends but, he is driving away customers! - I am estimating the business will lose about $3016.00 of business from my friends and I not returning back now or ever this year. $58/visit x 52 weeks potentially is big loss- maybe, when it starts hurting financially, will the guy's hurtful comments to his customers stop.Sorry, but, Superior(ity)  IS not cool.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,9.80000019073,"guy,restaurants,people,taco stands,things,taco stands,matter,neighbors,border,side,deal,taqueria,attitude,attitude,friends,South,Arizona,fella,portions,taco stand,kitchen,Superior,Superior,food,food,way,expectations,a la carte,plenty,friend,friend,people,things,guy,comments,breath comments,way,all,nastiness,expectations,rest,things,nastiness,breath,prices,eating place,par,occasions,reviews,douche bag,man,waiter,tables,friends,food,money,fools,Superior,customers,water,Psycho doucebag,feelings,kitchen staff,eyes,person,owner,Our Mexican,Cuban,ULTIMATE,Indian,comments,loss,business,business,customers,fella.DO,nothing,way,exchange,workers,workers,ass,unpleasantness,guys,slaves,course","1,2,1,2,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,1,7,2,2,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,1,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,5,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,1,3,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,7,2,3,2,5,4,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,1,7","0.118997707963,0.105465471745,0.0877695083618,0.0380504690111,0.0380504690111,0.0366481542587,0.0303581636399,0.0303581636399,0.0303581636399,0.0303581636399,0.0303581636399,0.0256566517055,0.0214175619185,0.0197106339037,0.0187725182623,0.0180452801287,0.0180452801287,0.0179472714663,0.0171491801739,0.0158635322005,0.0148330787197,0.0114005263895,0.010853224434,0.0091799274087,0.00745942117646,0.00693133287132,0.00630517071113,0.00554570136592,0.00554570136592,0.0053302324377,0.0053302324377,0.00519547984004,0.00507029518485,0.0050325030461,0.00466397916898,0.00466397916898,0.00465081445873,0.00443230802193,0.00424232846126,0.00424232846126,0.00423035165295,0.00392779894173,0.00385483982973,0.00385483982973,0.00372543022968,0.00372543022968,0.00371187389828,0.00371187389828,0.00371187389828,0.00371187389828,0.00371187389828,0.00371187389828,0.00370139302686,0.00359089882113,0.00338496244512,0.0033793724142,0.0033793724142,0.00297251017764,0.00285762455314,0.00251985178329,0.00251191644929,0.00250545446761,0.00250545446761,0.00250545446761,0.00250269216485,0.00250015384518,0.00221281382255,0.00219765701331,0.00219765701331,0.00219765701331,0.00217136112042,0.0021434109658,0.00197662389837,0.00197662389837,0.00197489536367,0.00169526203535,0.00142417731695,0.00138654164039,0.00135143962689,0.00126105418894,0.00125917175319,0.00117744784802,0.00110322411638,0.00110157718882,0.0011001060484,0.000647565873805"

I wish i'd been able to eat it a littttttle faster, before the bread started falling apart on me, but that's the nature of the dish.Queso Fundido: A+        You'd be surprised, but I've had some bad queso fundido (I know, how could you mess up melted cheese...) but this was sublime. Needed extra tortillas which were brought quick and hot! Gooey, cheesy goodness with some excellent chorizo on top.Cebollitas: A                   Grilled up giant sweet scallions. Crunchy and satisfying. My new side veggie of choice.Gorditas: A                      Little sandwich/pockets with queso fresco, lettuce, and chorizo. Kind of like the sandwich version of a sope. The bread was piping hot and fresh and the lettuce added that amazing crunch to each bite. Served with 2 per order. Yum-my.All around great night-- packed even on a Wednesday!

I'd heard other people mention the poor service at  La Superior, but I really never expected to be treated as poorly as I was.

In you live in Williamsburg, this place is worth your money.I went here last night for some after-work drinks with a friend, around 7:30PM on a Wednesday night. I was skeptical at first because it's such an isolated hole in the wall, but La Superior lived up to its name (and then some!) As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by a perky, friendly hostess who sat us at a small window counter that doubles as a table when it's nice outside. Within minutes we had our drinks and an order of guacamole, perfectly sized for 2-3 people.We each ordered the guava margarita; a large is $11 and worth every penny. For food, the waitress spouted off an impressive list of daily specials, including fish tacos, cactus tacos, and even a unique rib-eye steak offering. At around $2.25 each, you can feel free to mix-and-match your options, so I had the pollo mole, the aforementioned cactus and rib-eye tacos, and a traditional carne asada taco. All of them were fresh, hot, and authentic.Thanks to fast, friendly service, we enjoyed a quick meal (under an hour) and a pleasant chat, and we never felt rushed or bothered.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,82730,"There are certain places I have learned to avoid at certain times of the day, or simply entire days. La Superior is one of those places for me, as I have experienced the poor service, super crowded and loud environment that so many of the other reviewers have complained about. Now, I just go during the day for lunch, or early evening on a weekend and I get great service and never regret going. Look, if you expect them to not crowd as many people in their tiny space as possible simply because you don't like rubbing elbows with the table next to you I believe you're missing the point. First, this is a business, and a busy night is a good thing for them. Second, they are trying to foster a very communal street feel or almost family style of eating that is very common in Mexican cuisine, especially from where I'm in San Diego. I recommend you say hello and perhaps smile at your neighbor rather than detest that you can hear what they are ordering. With that said, the food is solid, and consistent, and consistency is something I love. The tacos are small, sure, but the flavor packed into each bite is massive. I always get the Rajas taco, lengua (tongue) taco which is simply the best three bites of meat you can possibly have, and a wild card taco. Three tacos for about 11 bucks is a deal in my opinion, and when you add in the guac for only 5 bucks (mole charges $11-$15) and a beer or two it's one of the best deals in the hood for Mexican. So my suggestion is if you don't like crowds or hurried servers, go during the day, it's that simple.

I then noticed that they violated a cardinal rule of sandwich making, never cut through the bottom of the sandwich bread, you ruin the integrity of the bread and everything falls out! Come on La Superior! I expected better!The sandwich did taste good, the steak was well flavored, not as tender as I would have liked, but still not too chewy. The pico de gallo was fresh and added a nice flavor as well.

Erin M., who is secretly a hipster and a pseudo-vegetarian (love you boo!), decided she wanted tacos last week, and took me here. While I wasn't impressed with the amount of fixies parked outside, I did think the food was rather delicious. Although, I'd rather eat tacos in Sunset Park, or hell, from anyone who is actually Mexican, any day. The server was nice and let us sit at a four-top even though it was busy and our friend was running late so there were only three of us for almost half the time we were there. Service was prompt and friendly. The ezquites (corn-and-mayo) was my favourite thing, it was delicious like whoa. I also had the rajas tacos (pablano peppers) which were excellente. Yeah, I said it. Excellente. I wouldn't seek this place out - the ambiance just isn't my style, and you can get equivalent tacos elsewhere - but it was a solid three star experience. Oh, and btw, I had the spicy mexican drinkie-drink that you pour beer over? I don't remember the name and I can't find it on the website, but it kinda tasted gross to me.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,193735,"I feel very conflicted about reviewing this restaurant. It's actually one of the first I've reviewed on Yelp, yet I felt so strongly compelled to forewarn other patrons in a place such as Williamsburg where the dining options are so plentiful.The food was excellent, and the margaritas were divine. As my husband is from Texas, we don't take our Mexican food lightly and he specifically took us here because the food was nearly unrivaled in the area. However, I (and all of our dinner companions) was truly appalled by the service and the attitude of our server. I understand that the restaurant is small, and they desire to move patrons through that are not actively spending money. HOWEVER. We were aggressively rushed out and treated very disrespectfully, in the actual MIDST of us ordering food and drinks. It simply makes no logical sense to be so astonishingly rude to patrons that are continuing to spend plentiful amounts of money. We aren't rich assholes and we all respect people who work in any food service or customer service industry. But even a group of people that would have been more than  willing to waive a bit of snark and attitude here and there (hey, thus is the nature of Williamsburg), were blown away by the sheer unprofessionalism and rudeness. It was one of those once-in-a-lifetime instances that if the tip had not been previously factored into the bill, we would not have tipped our waitress because she couldn't even muster basic respect or graciousness that unfortunately, is a necessary trait to be exercised in the food service industry.Ourselves and our guests arrived at this restaurant early, ahead of the rush that we had anticipated and planned around accordingly.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,6908,"** 3.5 stars **Off on a quiet Williamsburg block is this low-key taqueria, one of the better known taco joints in the area, which led to making its way onto our food run itinerary.  Sporting a cocky name, a shock of red on two walls, and surprisingly tasteful wallpaper on another, this small place feels like a cool friend's casual but funky living room.  All it needs is a classic crystal chandelier.  Rickety wood furniture and simple benches fill out the dining space, anchored by a cozy, utilitarian bar, over which hangs the old-fashioned menu board, flanked by more menu items, colored chalk on blackboard.During that late afternoon, there were few in the warm dining room, the sun streaming in.  Service was friendly and easy-going.  The careworn menu is artfully designed, using fonts and letter/digit placement to great effect.  Their short lunch menu offers one or two of various Mexican street foods, including guacamole, flautas, tortas, enchiladas, sopas, and frijoles.  But the lengthiest selection, and our objective, were their tacos.  At a competitive $2.50 each for most, there's a wide selection with twists on classic preparations.  Not enough to go nouveau, but enough to set them apart from the usual Mexican taco joint.Their tacos are beautifully presented, very generously mounded on a single tortilla.  The latter was average, but the fillings were delicious, a diverse mix of flavors and textures that makes a good taco.  The Rajas, roasted poblano pepper strips, was one of the best, creamy, ""meaty,"" with just the right crunch and kick from onions.  The seafood tacos, pescado and camaron, were not fried and good, although not the best versions of either I've had in NYC.  Lengua, while tender, could use more flavor.Unable to resist, we sampled the sesadillas, pork brain quesadillas.  Unlike my previous experience with naked pork brain (scooped out of a roasted pig head), this version doesn't look as much like its origin but has the same smooth texture and subtle, slightly nutty flavor.Of their aguas frescas, pineapple was refreshing and tasty, prickly pear subtle (prefer the taco version). There's alcohol but skipped on it.I confess to being less enamored with La Superior than so many love-struck reviews I've seen, not helped by coming with some expectations, never a great thing to do to an eatery.  Still, its a decent taqueria, and certainly worth going back to try out the rest of the menu and other tacos.  Best avoided at peak dining hours, I can see it mobbed.  Cash only, the already economical menu prices include tax.",3.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, NY",3,0,0.699999988079,13.8999996185,"taco joints,taqueria,way,one,stars,block,area,food run itinerary,Williamsburg,place,wallpaper,walls,shock,another,red,name,bar,version,lunch menu,mix,menu,crystal chandelier,living room,tacos,taco,alcohol,friend,dining space,menu board,menu items,chalk,benches,tacos,selection,one,Service,taco,dining room,letter/digit placement,flavors,tortas,street foods,best,latter,wood furniture,tortilla,textures,Mexican,fonts,sun,effect,frijoles,sopas,flautas,enchiladas,objective,preparations,twists,most,nouveau,average,poblano pepper strips,crunch,onions,pescado,camaron,taco version,pineapple,rest,texture,tacos,menu,aguas frescas,origin,reviews,seafood tacos,Rajas,guacamole,expectations,taqueria,menu prices,Cash,selection,thing,eatery,tax,La Superior,fillings,versions,flavor.,pork brain,experience,pork brain quesadillas,sesadillas,tender,pig head,NYC,Lengua","7,7,7,1,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,5,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,1,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,3,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1","0.202996760607,0.0501026585698,0.0456050746143,0.0444926843047,0.0433833375573,0.0355138815939,0.0355138815939,0.0355138815939,0.0211250130087,0.0193907134235,0.0193907134235,0.0193907134235,0.0169776827097,0.0169776827097,0.0169776827097,0.0169776827097,0.0163704194129,0.012353817001,0.0112378494814,0.0100017553195,0.00919772684574,0.00801523122936,0.00742429355159,0.00707368785515,0.00705373799428,0.00655686575919,0.00649688998237,0.00644012959674,0.00644012959674,0.00644012959674,0.00644012959674,0.00644012959674,0.00621502846479,0.00572701077908,0.00525393988937,0.00517821032554,0.00500523485243,0.00497034145519,0.00494488049299,0.00493696937338,0.00493523478508,0.00493523478508,0.00493153138086,0.00469175726175,0.00463337916881,0.00449609709904,0.00449067167938,0.00441110786051,0.00438187271357,0.00434899143875,0.00432670861483,0.00431826664135,0.00431826664135,0.00431826664135,0.00431826664135,0.00431096740067,0.00430453941226,0.00430453941226,0.00430453941226,0.00429879734293,0.00392920104787,0.00392487179488,0.00392487179488,0.00392487179488,0.00392089271918,0.00392089271918,0.00367452693172,0.00349193951115,0.00335633964278,0.00334221543744,0.00331852631643,0.00305476831272,0.00292418547906,0.00292418547906,0.00292179430835,0.0027884056326,0.00277513009496,0.00253592594527,0.00231221364811,0.0023104371503,0.0021780685056,0.0021780685056,0.00213452009484,0.00202291808091,0.00202291808091,0.00201851502061,0.00172967114486,0.00170193414669,0.00161477876827,0.00161326199304,0.00146598229185,0.00146598229185,0.00128363794647,0.00128363794647,0.00128363794647,0.00128251512069,0.000760431634262,0.000759717077017"

Since it was a weekday, and after the lunch rush (I was there around 2pm) the place was pretty quiet. I was quickly seated, pleasantly helped by friendly waitstaff, and properly advised as far as how many tacos I should order - always a question I have when I visit a restaurant for the first time. The menu was really inexpensive, and I ended up ordering just 2 tacos and one of their in-house juices - the limonade one (get this!!). I decided on having the fish taco - since I am always on the quest for the best fish taco in NYC - and one of the beef tongue tacos. I have to say, the beef tongue was amazing. I have had beef tongue before, but never in taco form. The cubed tongue was soft and flavorful and topped with cilantro and raw onion. The fish (i don't recall what kind of fish) was more sauced since it was topped with their homemade pico. Both were really tasty and as for as light lunch - you can't beat 2 tacos, and a refreshing juice for under $10 total. Yup. That's right. My bill was $9.50.

It's totally unassuming from the outside, but it fits in great with the stark and industrial feel of Berry Street. Berry and Wythe are in my opinion the best two streets in Williamsburg (and Grand Street, west of the BQE. Anyway, the food that they offer is two things: small, and cheap. So, everything that they have is relatively to very inexpensive, but you'll have to order your fair share to fill up. The tacos that they have are amazing, and the whole restaurant is very authentic. It's also a small restaurant, so show up a few minutes before you'd actually like to eat.The food itself is really unique, and is much like the food you would actually be offered in the small towns of Latin America. For example, their cochinita pibil taco, a slow-cooked pork in banana leaves should most certainly be tried. And while more adventurous options include the pig brains and beef tongue, there are more user-friendly options like the skirt steak or the fish, grilled or fried.

Now, we were warned by our waiter the chicken is hot, do you like spicy things? yes I do but...I wasnt aware hot was a flavor. They were too hot to eat and didnt actually taste like anything chicken was a bit rubbery I didnt even eat one of them. Steak taco came with some nice pico on top, it had no flavor at all tho. So after being unable to eat the chicken tacos we ordered another steak taco and my friend got taquitos, the taquitos were a little soggy and totally flavorless but my second steak taco was GREAT! wayyy better than the first one I had ordered.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,16209,"This is definitely the best LA-style taco in New York. They serve the meats in small, legit-style corn tortillas and they are very, very spicy. Take a look at the distribution of ratings on this site, mostly 4/5s and 1s. You know what that means? It's LEGIT. The 4/5's like Mexican food, the 1's don't. Stick to your whackhattan table-side guacamole service, you're embarrassing yourself.I've had both styles of the shrimp taco, the really good one and the really, really good one that burns your throat with it's might. The fish taco is solid, with bits of broiled fish in a spicy pepper sauce. I don't eat meat, but my carnivorous friends couldn't contain their glee at the carne asada and random acts of pork. The chips and guacamole is solid, and the salsas are authentically thin and hot. They don't have a liquor license, so order yourself a prickly pear aqua fresca and save yourself some cash. There's no cheese on the tacos, synthetic yellow or otherwise. There's no iceberg lettuce or diced tomatoes. This is legitimate Los Angles-style Mexican food. The service is intermittent, but the food is always amazing. The chilaquiles are great, but I'm pretty much a tacos and aqua fresca guy. The atmosphere is equally legit and laid back. There's an old sign that's been reclaimed as a menu and a dia de los muertos skate deck on the wall. On a recent visit the owner played Aphex Twin, Sabres of Paradise and Lemon Jelly.

Delicious and (relatively) nutritious!FAT-KID DINNER:Oh man, the special skirtsteak taco + duck taco= my personal heaven on a plate.

Also, I do occasionally get the guacamole though I find myself eating ALL of it in that case...DRINKS:If you like Bloody Mary's as a hangover cure (i.e., spicy and alcoholic!), then the Tamarindo margarita is La Superior's answer to what ails you...merging a house-blend of hot peppery spices with the sweetness of tamarind juice and a hefty portion of Herradura tequila, this will get you back in fighting shape in no time at all! :) It is my favorite margarita. ever.AMBIANCE:Many of the previous review are entertaining for their disdain of the waitstaff. My advice to would-be diners at La Superior: be realistic! Don't go here and expect to receive red carpet-treatment in exchange for your $4 taco purchase--meaning, don't take it personally if the servers and bartenders are actually busy and waiting on 10 tables at a time while taking reservations for new tables, handing off takeout, putting in drink orders, etc. The place is small and the PLATES are small, so the servers and bartenders have to run faster, talk faster (or less), and think 5 steps ahead of you and your friends to get your tacos to you while they're still hot!To put it bluntly, they're almost always BUSY (all caps!). If you hate crowds, go early during the day on weekends, and/or on a weeknight.That said, for every would-be diner who whines about having to wait for 20 minutes, there will surely be a crowd of new patrons waiting to take their place in line just as they're walking away.

Pretty much SOP there - at least they're consistent? The service isn't so much unpleasant as simply not present. Aloof and / or untrained. Extra annoying was that when our server brought our change (it's cash only, btw) she short changed us by a quarter. Maybe she just sucked at math or wasn't paying attention. But, then when I tipped her I put cash in the tray and slid the quarter we did get back to my wife but the server came and scooped it up while we were still sitting there and put it in the tray!

Don't quasi-steal it. You'll feel better about yourself.The food is generally still good but a bit of refinement and sophistication seems to be slipping. The black bean soup used to be subtlety smokey and complex. Today it was unseasoned and bland. The quest fundido came out luke warm so it lost its gooeyness after two tortillas. The torta ahogado lacked spice and seasoning. The rajas were still delicious and, while I didn't have the cochinita pibil today, that is generally very good.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,19145,"I had the privilege of getting dinner at la Superior the other night and  I was 4 stars pleased. The lay out of this restaraunte is pretty cozy with not many seats available, and I'm not sure if they take reservations or not but if they do not, you definitely want to show up at or before 6 because it began to get quite crowded right around that time.  The lack of seating is one of the few reasons I gave this place  four. I love authentic Mexican and this place is very close to being authentic Mexican but it's lack of seating doesn't allow everyone to enjoy this great place. After perusing the menu, I decided on the enchiladas with a nice Negro Modelo and my friend decided to have a nice margarita and a small shrimp which she stated that she very much enjoyed. My enchiladas were good but not great. They simply tasted cheesy rather then delicious and the chicken inside was a little dry for my taste.

This place deserves every bit of the B rating they got. I came here last weekend and this place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days... A little gross was an understatement.I was apologetically handed an old menu that was covered in last night's (it was crusty) guacamole and liquor stains. Honestly, I would have just waited 'till a cleaner menu was available -- it was that gross. That said, if your menu is just a piece of paper, why the restaurant doesn't have lots of extras on hand is beyond me.ATMOSPHEREWe came here for brunch on one of the last cold days of this winter and for whatever reason it was actually colder in the restaurant than outside. After a few attempts to turn on the measly heater, the bartender just gave up. I realize that hipsters don't feel things like the temperature, but I was absolutely freezing...Also worth noting that the draft coming off the walls is crazy. This place is shack-chic, but this literally means crumbling walls.FOODThe agua frescas were delicious, but the food was just ok. I didn't try the tacos (which seems to be their 'thing') opting instead for a brunch plate with eggs, ham , beans and peas. Boyfriend got chorizo and eggs -- small portion and sadly, the chorizo wasn't packing much flavor at all.Probably not worth a trip back unless I do taco takeout so I don't have to walk into the place.",2.0 star rating,"Westport, CT",2,1,-0.40000000596,7.40000009537,"CLEANLINESSI,restaurants,atmosphere,guacamole,parts,review,piece,tacos,place,DOH A-rated,place,menu,menu,bit,brunch,B rating,lots,restaurant,restaurant,place,things,food,liquor stains,me.,one,hand,extras,paper,thing,reason,attempts,heater,bartender,temperature,hipsters,Boyfriend,eggs,ATMOSPHEREWe,peas,beans,brunch plate,ham,place,taco takeout,chorizo,eggs,chorizo,portion,flavor,all.,trip,draft,walls,FOODThe,agua frescas","7,2,2,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,1","0.264221966267,0.0628771260381,0.0573115907609,0.0546970777214,0.050276953727,0.050276953727,0.039375256747,0.0365682281554,0.0325294993818,0.0299915801734,0.029946776107,0.0280159786344,0.0254095587879,0.0241232812405,0.0197869502008,0.00925046391785,0.00754637829959,0.00745356315747,0.00708571402356,0.00658438866958,0.00642232596874,0.00629053963348,0.00619485648349,0.00616314262152,0.00616314262152,0.00616314262152,0.00616314262152,0.00616314262152,0.00586115196347,0.00564047880471,0.00562948128209,0.00562948128209,0.00562948128209,0.00561997154728,0.00561997154728,0.00538872880861,0.00478623434901,0.00461714994162,0.00418794481084,0.00418794481084,0.00418794481084,0.00418794481084,0.00391737977043,0.00359292305075,0.0035271581728,0.00331061007455,0.00331061007455,0.00289656687528,0.00289656687528,0.00289656687528,0.00289656687528,0.00225700321607,0.00210610823706,0.001368684927,0.00079661689233"

Went with the spicy shrimp (great but pretty hot, make sure you only order it if you don't mind that), garlic shrimp (amazing, the best of the three), and the grilled fish (also great). I also got a chicken quesadilla, which is really an empanada with cheese on top and inside, and while it was good, I wasn't in the mood for deep fried food and it's something I'd avoid next time around. It didn't compare to the tacos anyway.The tacos are very basic and don't come with the usual lettuce, beans, etc., but it doesn't matter. There's so much flavor in the fillings that you won't  care.4 tacos should be enough if you have a normal appetite, and it won't run you more than $10-12. Get another one or two if you're hungry. For high quality casual sit down Mexican food, you really can't complain about those prices.Interesting margaritas and all the usual Mexican beers you'd expect to see.

I am going to hope that the kinks are worked out because they just opened.  Had the food not been so good - I would not go out of my way to stop in again because of the service.  The Good:  The food was very good.  Currently BYOB so my hubbie went out and got a six pack from the bodega at the corner and I had a watermelon agua fresca.  Very good.  We started with the guacamole and also the ezquites - both good but I have to say on the corn that it should be somewhat mixed more and perhaps just doing an elote may be better only because the moisture from the corn kinda waters all the flavor down and collects at the bottom of the cup.  My husband got the Torta Ahogada and I got the Pescado Pibil - my husband liked his though he didn't share a bite with me and my entree was excellent.  Also got two tacos shrimp and pork which were great.  The Bad:  One - no signage on the restaurant - they posted a menu on the front door which would have been fine if their name was on it. Two- the server was doing everything - taking orders, making drinks and calculating checks.  The bus persons were serving the food and attending to the tables ...which would have been great but they seemed to be totally lost - they brought stuff to the wrong tables, asked if dishes were ours but didn't seem to be able to identify the dishes and if asked to get something (like say another agua fresca) couldn't seem to figure out the request. The timing of the meal was also totally off - my husband got his entree and ate the entire thing by the time I got my food.  All in all I still liked the place - everyone was friendly and most importantly the food was good and affordable.",3.0 star rating,"Lakewood, OH",2,1,0.10000000149,9.30000019073,"food,husband,kinks,service,place,food,door,stars,husband,hubbie,service,corner,agua fresca,bus persons,way,Good,bodega,watermelon,tables,entree,corn,corn,bite,BYOB,pack,name,flavor,bottom,cup,elote,more,guacamole,ezquites,pork,signage,menu,restaurant,something,timing,agua fresca,tables,dishes,tacos shrimp,All,Bad,request,meal,server,everyone,moisture,food,thing,Pescado Pibil,Torta Ahogada,entree,stuff,drinks,dishes,orders,checks","7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.219270378351,0.147833317518,0.130689010024,0.058078572154,0.0549339540303,0.0358045622706,0.0356669872999,0.0331098772585,0.0122060766444,0.0108449840918,0.0106457090005,0.010577195324,0.00962285976857,0.00856839027256,0.00847632437944,0.00844553485513,0.0084217293188,0.0084217293188,0.00775413727388,0.00771500449628,0.00711600342765,0.00711600342765,0.00649984693155,0.0064278007485,0.00621577864513,0.00616147136316,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00566440215334,0.00516741303727,0.0051605226472,0.0051605226472,0.0051605226472,0.00495666125789,0.00458925543353,0.0043970188126,0.0043970188126,0.0043970188126,0.00420902296901,0.00398961966857,0.00393759831786,0.00384725653566,0.00384335662238,0.0033512879163,0.00303888041526,0.00289418362081,0.00281976349652,0.00266126007773,0.00247056991793,0.00247056991793,0.00224383361638,0.00223072734661,0.00217727362178,0.00190478516743,0.00168956792913,0.000560428074095"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,194497,"This was an unfortunate experience because otherwise it would get a four star review. However, given our treatment on our last visit, I'd give it 0 stars if that were possible. Let me start off by saying that I have worked in restaurants and bars for 15 years and lived in Williamsburg for 6 years. In general the service in Williamsburg stinks. La Superior was no different, but at least the food was good. We began frequenting this place on a recommendation from our good friends and I must admit, it is very good and inexpensive Mexican food. We enjoyed it so much that we had a small party here for my sister's 30th. Unfortunately, on our next visit, everything fell apart. We sat down for dinner with two friends after waiting a few minutes for a table. Everything with the dinner was fine...typical La Superior - everything comes out when it's ready, so if you order tacos those will be out quickly while other stuff might take an additional 20 minutes. Like I said, we've dined there before so we knew what to expect. The server dropped the check after we were finished eating. We each had maybe 1/3 of a beer left, so we paid and were finishing our beers when the server asked us if we could leave. Ehhh...not exactly how I would have handled it but OK. We said we were finishing our beers and would be out in a few minutes. Maybe 2 minutes later, another server comes and asks us to leave. We say, yeah, we just told the other guy that we're going to finish our drinks and then we'll be out of your way. Less than 1 minute later (maybe if you stopped interrupting us we could finish our beers), the owner, Felipe, comes up and asks us to leave as well. This pissed my wife and me off, so she lays into him, basically telling him that we've been coming there regularly for months and if he doesn't do something to make it right, he's going to lose us as customers for life. He was very smug and clearly couldn't give a shit whether we ever set foot in there again. Needless to say we haven't been back and we won't be recommending it ever again either. It's unfortunate because it really is good food, but I refuse to patronize a restaurant with that kind of an attitude towards their customers. I could understand if we had just cracked open new beers and were camping at the table, but that was not the case. As a former server, I understand that turning over tables is key, but as the owner, you've got to do everything you can to retain repeat customers.  There are a lot of other restaurants that deserve my $ far more than La Superior.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,13.8000001907,"experience,star review,beers,service,restaurants,food,visit,server,treatment,bars,stars,Williamsburg,food,everything,food,La Superior,everything,server,friends,visit,Everything,recommendation,place,sister,party,stuff,table,friends,dinner,dinner,lot,Felipe,tacos,check,beer left,way,drinks,Mexican,customers,restaurant,everything,wife,guy,repeat customers,foot,attitude,kind,beers,server,table,restaurants,owner,case,shit,customers,something,tables,life","7,7,6,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,1,7,4,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,3,1,7,7,1,7,7,7","0.234973803163,0.0782967954874,0.0420132912695,0.0413505397737,0.0363371707499,0.0337376110256,0.0332354195416,0.0298157967627,0.0290950611234,0.0289465002716,0.0236339457333,0.0221114680171,0.0170942600816,0.0167758911848,0.0164955910295,0.015511113219,0.013320568949,0.0128681007773,0.0125398337841,0.0124942399561,0.0118859549984,0.010972735472,0.010972735472,0.0109513346106,0.0109513346106,0.0101041728631,0.00926168169826,0.00842430163175,0.00842430163175,0.00841306336224,0.00823868066072,0.00755425309762,0.00736102741212,0.00734403915703,0.00733659369871,0.00669097527862,0.00669097527862,0.00649799453095,0.00626134220511,0.00626134220511,0.00578185077757,0.00558131653816,0.00519262673333,0.00504193082452,0.00498855300248,0.0049825287424,0.0049825287424,0.00495226634666,0.00494959484786,0.00433267094195,0.00432809256017,0.00393850915134,0.00367320538498,0.00354236224666,0.00275131501257,0.00271588866599,0.00226792111062,0.00218911562115"

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,151700,"I stumbled upon this place after getting my usual 2am craving for tacos at a nearby rooftop party. I was a bit put off at first by the fact that they only serve soft shell (i know hard shells are tex mex, and not authentic, but I prefer them anyway), and then by the miniscule size of the tacos. As soon as I took a bite however, I threw all reservations out the window. These things are EXCELLENT. The menu is authentic mexico city-style street food. Tacos are tiny, but pack in a huge punch of flavor, made with all fresh ingredients, and at $2.50 a pop, they're not horribly pricey either. The chorizo gorditas and steak tacos are my favorite. I've gone back countless times since, and have brought friends-both local and visitors. Perfect for a snack if you're in the hood, but also great to load up on a bunch of different things for a full dinner, and worth the trek even for manhattanites and non-williamsburgers.

I would say they're the best tacos I have had in NYC.  I went around 10 on a Friday and it was still very busy, all the tables were filled, but as a party of two we were seated very fast.  We ordered the salsa appetizer, a great order.  It comes with like 6 or 7 different salsa, varying in levels of heat, and all were damn good.  Loved the salsa verde, and I added it to all the other food as it came.  Then we ordered the jalapeno rellenos, which are fried and filled with a great white cheese, and you should eat them as soon as they arrive at the table!  The cheese bursts into your mouth.  We ordered 5 tacos.  A shrimp special with garlic was our favorite; the fish taco on the menu is great served with like a creamy cilantro sauce, carnita taco tastes like bacon, and the carne asada was good, but probably the least special of the lot.  All the tacos are true California/Mex style- tiny little flour tortillas with the ingredients on top, perfect to pop in your mouth or cut into two pieces.The Cochinita platter was UNBELIEVABLE.  The diced pork is cooked in an incredibly dense sauce and it's perfect with a little salsa or veggie on top. The grilled cebollas are a perfect antitode to the whole meal- and something I have never seen served outside of California.  Upon thinking back on the meal, I think there were 3 life-affirming items we ordered.  1. Jalapeno Rellenos 2.  Shrimp Taco special 3.  Cochinita.  We BYOB's a bottle of vino and the whole dinner was around 30 bucks.  It's cute inside too.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.5,11.6999998093,"tacos,jalapeno rellenos,flour tortillas,cheese,La Superior,salsa verde,tables,meal,NYC,salsa,fish taco,two,tacos,party,order,salsa appetizer,heat,levels,taco,table,mouth,shrimp,carne asada,favorite,California,cilantro sauce,antitode,food,garlic,menu,bacon,lot,special,all,top,veggie,something,cebollas,dinner,Mex,bottle,vino,Shrimp Taco,salsa,platter,mouth,sauce,Jalapeno Rellenos,ingredients,pork,items,Cochinita","6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.127647951245,0.0885863751173,0.0602398328483,0.058324970305,0.0575169920921,0.0573722943664,0.0506044216454,0.0297164004296,0.0264646559954,0.0228186883032,0.0209023002535,0.0194189175963,0.0170981679112,0.0169961694628,0.0169344581664,0.0169344581664,0.0168867465109,0.0168867465109,0.0156288705766,0.0129810301587,0.0129591142759,0.012922571972,0.0123560866341,0.0120472395793,0.0119839310646,0.0118269687518,0.0117071503773,0.0113817593083,0.0113083971664,0.0113083971664,0.0103493500501,0.0103493500501,0.0103493500501,0.00990280322731,0.00771614955738,0.00771614955738,0.00770832924172,0.00723518338054,0.00634354213253,0.00612209411338,0.00531220762059,0.00531220762059,0.00475949794054,0.00457902159542,0.00404729926959,0.00387369492091,0.00386942387559,0.00360246608034,0.00338902347721,0.00338528631255,0.0023095163051,0.00200598523952"

Each item was very tasty but not mind blowing.

I had a quad-o (or what do you call a trio but with four?) of tacos, and they were very delicious, especially the tongue taco!  Incredible texture.  If you've been thinking about trying tongue but have been a little apprehensive because, well, it's TONGUE, I'd say this is a good gateway tongue.  Tongue 101. An introduction to Tongue for the Complete Novice. The chipotle shrimp was in fact too spicy for me to eat, but the more capsaicin-tolerant of my party were happy to oblige. In return, I got bites of  torta, fish, quesadilla, and.......BRAINS!!Yes, they have brains here.  How much more normal did tongue just get?  The brains are wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried, and the whole thing tastes kind of like a super-creamy crab rangoon.  Very nice.  I won't lie--as a neuroscientist I felt a little conflicted, but I got over that pretty fast.Finally, these are probably the best margaritas I've had in the city.  No crappy sour mix here--just tequilla, lime, and maybe just a splash of simple syrup.

No tastebuds and they've cooked it down so it's nice and tender) but I was less than impressed with the camarones (shrimp) tacos which were swimming unnecessarily in a sauce, sogging up the tortilla.Despite my complaints, which are mostly based on how cheap I think Mexican food should be, this was a good meal, but I'm not convinced this is the best Mexican place in New York.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,1721,"It took me a few visits to get a good read on La Superior. On one hand, it seemed like one of the more authentic Mexican restaurants in Williamsburg. On the other, the tiny portions and tiny seating area make me a skeptic. Finally, an early dinner on a Sunday cemented my 5-star review. Here's why:Judging by previous meals, I knew to order more than one taco if I was hungry. Two of us split a few appetizers and had a quesadilla each. Even with a margarita, the bill was under $40. For Williamsburg, that's a cheap dinner.We asked how they made their margaritas and the response was ""We make them how we make them, and they're delicious."" I loved the confidence in that statement, and she was right.

My tacos came and they were tiny tortillas with a MOUND of pico de gallo on each. Fish taco with pico de gallo? The pork one also had some sort of picked item on it that tasted like hot dog relish. 20 minutes later the enchiladas arrived, which was just bland chicken wrapped in a tortilla topped with a little bit of cheese, an ENTIRE chopped raw onion, and swimming in bland tomatillo sauce.

But it seemed like at every last twist and turn, I was getting gouged. The serving of tequila came in a tiny hospital medicine sized shot glass and wasn't full. The tacos were small. Chips and salsa costs four bucks. The gordita was small... On the flip side, at least the margarita and ceviche were decent sized. The corn was  undersized.They also attempt to pack as many people into a very small space. So packed was the restaurant on a random weeknight that I was bumped into about 45 times by the staff. No, I'm not exaggerating. It became almost comical, and was taken to the next level when one of the staff members asked me to move closer into the tiny aisle space. The only person who seemed to get it was someone who seemed like a manager, and was able to move my seat a bit further away from the aisle.On to the food. Some of it was good, some was not. The guacamole came pre-made. The tacos were very hit or miss. Biggest hit was the shrimp. It was delicious, I could eat it all night. But then the rajas? What was that? Roasted poblano strips sounds awesome, but the final product was more like a side dish. Just because you put something in a tortilla, doesn't make it a taco. The special taco of the day, garlic shrimp or something, was mediocre. The pork, which they heavily tout, needed to simmer longer and wasn't as fall apart juicy as I'd have liked. The lengua in the gordita was also devoid of taste. I'm not sure how you manage this, seeing as lengua is intensely flavorful, but they did. At least the gordita shell was good. The corn was decent.Much of the crowd seemed to be content at sipping a margarita, lazily taking chips with some guac on them and making chit chat.

My friend and I were in the neighborhood on the mission to complete a mini-food crawl. La Superior was our first stop.We started out with the guacamole and chips. Loved the guacamole - creamy with a zing to it - but the chips didn't seem too fresh. For our entree, we each got three tacos.

La Superior,5340,295 Berry St,Brooklyn,11211.0,11665,"For whatever it's worth, here's my disappointing story of the disrespectful service we were treated to last night at La Superior: My man and I were planning our Friday night, considering our nearby dinner options, when we both decided that the nearby options wouldn't do it for us and we hopped in a car to our beloved La Superior.Beloved? Well, we call LS our favorite spot in Wburg. We bring all our visiting and unacquainted friends there (in May, my mom and in June his sister in from Chicago). We're there twice a month or more.Last night we arrived around 7:45. It was busy as usual. We gave the host our name and navigated the small waiting area with the rest of the crowd, angling for clear standing space and a drink from the busy bar. After about 35 minutes we were finishing our margaritas and had ended up in a spot behind two people finishing up their meal at the end of the small bar. Right then, an older man (clearly, a rich local Wburg dude) walked in with his daughter/girlfriend. I saw him motion to the bartender and make his way to the area right behind us. I could feel him behind me making what seemed to be a play for the two seats my man and I were standing behind.The two people at the bar got up and my man said to the older dude, ""We're going to sit here."" To which he replied out loud ""Oh,"" but then most likely in his mind, ""well, no you're not because my buddy the bartender has my back. I tip big."" We sat down, got menus and proceeded to settle in when the bartender came over, and in a rushed manner said that people were waiting and there was a list and we couldn't just sit down. My boyfriend bristled. But, knowing the bartender was right, I said, ""okay, sure, go check the list and if there's someone before us, we'll get up."" I could see at this point we were clearly up next anyway so I really didn't think there was any need for anyone to get worked up. He and the host talked, motioning to us, motioning to the list and motioning to the older fellow and his daughter/girlfriend. It was 100% crystal clear what was happening at this point -- we were in fact up next but the fellow who had just walked in was going to get the bar seats and special treatment over us.The bartender came over and bumbled through multiple explanations of why we had to get up. They included various total b.s. that made us annoyed because I guess he thinks we're either a) idiots or b) he doesn't give a crap about us anyway. The garbled reasons he gave included: 1 -- The bar seats were on a separate list and we were on the ""table list.""2 -- We were in line for a table not the bar and couldn't just sit down at the bar if we were on the line for a table. (Whenever we're there it's clear that if you want to grab a bar seat and you are behind it when it opens, as we were, you grab it. Period.)3 -- The older fellow had called in and was therefore on the list ahead of us. (This is the most interesting bit of b.s. because what it says to me is that RESERVATIONS ARE ACCEPTED AT LA SUPERIOR. Interesting.)So they made us get up. My boyfriend was really pissed. We felt embarrassed, disrespected and screwed over by a place we give our money to frequently and which we quite like and evangelize all over NYC and beyond.We told the bartender and host that this was total bull and were ushered over to a table that clearly wasn't truly ready for us -- it's unclear whether it was wiped at all but I know it lacked napkins which I only discovered AFTER my pavo escabeche taco arrived with a way too soggy tortilla (because the beans had been prepped and sitting on it for too long before the turkey was ready) and the whole thing fell apart in my hands but behold, there was not a napkin in sight.Anyway, I think the whole crappy experience was made worse by the way we were treated AFTER our rightful seats at the bar were taken from us. The waitstaff, host and bartender all seemed to find our anger sort of amusing and they proceeded to alternately defend what happened, lie about what happened, or avoid us.In all of this we did find out that the older fellow is a regular who is ""in there everyday."" My family owned a restaurant in NYC for 15+ years and I waitressed professionally for 5+ years. Regulars DO get special service. BUT they should not get special service at the price of disrespectful treatment of other customers. There's lot you can do as a host/bartender/server in that situation for the shafted customers -- You can be honest and apologize. You can make up a better lie. You can be super nice to make up for giving someone the shaft.  Sure maybe we were just passersby and would never come back again. But it turns out we're not.

The tacos are two-bite tacos (in my opinion) but man-o-man do they pack a punch.  My lady and I split four tacos, and the above-mentioned items, and left very pleased.  It certainly wasn't the cheap/quick bite to eat that we had in mind though.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,8.0,"tacos,time,dinner,place,rating,tacos,Everything,taco,tacos,meal,portions,ton,plates,appetite,La Superior,mine,joke,man-o-man,tacos,opinion,punch,lady,bite,tacos,items,mind,Service,gauc,chorizo gorditas,beans w/ bacon","7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.1731300354,0.146046608686,0.146046608686,0.0730516389012,0.0703589320183,0.0397968105972,0.0321035906672,0.0268218908459,0.0260194987059,0.0233300309628,0.0218169428408,0.0181186124682,0.0181186124682,0.0180259458721,0.0166793502867,0.0164986029267,0.016466461122,0.0140204522759,0.0133953243494,0.0122690135613,0.0122690135613,0.0122526595369,0.0103204604238,0.00852957461029,0.00848642457277,0.00847618374974,0.00643997546285,0.00643997546285,0.00233537820168,0.00233537820168"

I recommend the rajas--very tasty.  I should say that this is where my pricing issues lay: the price of the tacos and the portions of the tacos themselves.Otherwise, I feel the rest to be priced according NY standards.

(we asked for a take-out menu but apparently they are the same. here's a tip: when you're using ""mood lighting,"" gray 7-point type is not the best choice for the descriptions.) so we used the phone to light up the menu to read it, and ordered the tinga quesadilla, chorizo gorditas, carnitas tacos, the ahogado, and a fish taco. the pork is stellar, both in the taco and the ahogado. the fish, eh. the sauce tastes canned and the fish had no flavor. the gordita had so little chorizo that it was virtually nonexistent. the tinga was nice, but i've had better elsewhere.really, the whole experience was deeply unsatisfying. i wasn't hungry when i left, but i wasn't happy about what i ate (apart from the pork). it wasn't bad, it was just... average. the servers were friendly, but it was clear they just wanted to turn the table. and the music was ridiculously loud. i actually like to talk to to the person i'm having dinner with. people that think this is the best mexican in the city need to go to castro's or la fonda or acapulco deli and eat real mexican food. i grew up eating real mexican food. cooked by mexicans. this ain't it.",2.0 star rating,"Dallas, TX",2,1,-0.20000000298,12.3999996185,"table,place,review,dive,pain,dive,table,NYT,menu,stretch,people,Nobu,Per Se,tables,food,same,bags,coats,type,pork,menu,choice,fish,tip,type,fish taco,carnitas tacos,taco,fish,gordita,menus,phone,chorizo gorditas,ahogado,ahogado,chorizo,problem,descriptions,mood lighting,tinga quesadilla,flavor,sauce,music,pork,servers,average,person,mexican,people,mexicans,table,dinner,city,fonda,castro's,deli,tinga,experience","7,7,5,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,7,4,2,2,1,2,7,7","0.117349371314,0.099678196013,0.0880771428347,0.070027731359,0.0555914305151,0.0415753908455,0.0393355712295,0.0365772843361,0.0321664474905,0.0292588006705,0.0286631807685,0.0173684991896,0.0173684991896,0.0150506878272,0.0131636885926,0.012953594327,0.0111358435825,0.0111358435825,0.010433212854,0.00952670630068,0.00937923323363,0.0092463651672,0.00909376982599,0.00867926049978,0.00857581757009,0.0085621047765,0.0085621047765,0.00855267886072,0.00854401569813,0.00826495420188,0.00820199307054,0.00783373881131,0.00778844719753,0.00778844719753,0.00777987064794,0.00773881841451,0.00747691001743,0.00745581137016,0.00745581137016,0.00681503908709,0.00679425382987,0.00679425382987,0.00603485759348,0.0057880920358,0.00551266875118,0.00506068672985,0.00505081098527,0.00399493332952,0.00399493332952,0.00399052957073,0.00358359701931,0.00349726364948,0.0034952017013,0.0034952017013,0.0034952017013,0.0034952017013,0.00303485919721,0.00265513989143"

La Taverna,5341,946 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,11860,"Very impressed with our weekday evening dinner at this restaurant. The prices are very low for a dinner out which no one is used to these days. I had the chicken parm which is served with salad or pasta. The salad was your typical chopped romaine, nothing special, and the chicken was definitely flavorful. Portions were huge. With an entree you also get fresh warm bread with butter and the soup of the day which was a lentil soup. I couldn't believe all of this food was only $11.Drink menu is lacking and they definitely don't have all the proper licensing yet, but they're getting there.

No we're not talking 4 star award winning chef necessarily, nor anything extraordinarily experimental or fusion oriented.... BUT if you're in the mood for just better than average delicious Italian favorites, this is your go-to spot in Greenpoint. Plus side: the food taste, quality, portions and price. And the servers all very nice (though primarily Hispanic rather than italian, and yeah that is def kind of a drag, let's be honest. It does take away the full fledged legitimacy of the immersion experience.) Minuses: The ONLY thing we may have found ""not quite perfect"" was the canolli wasn't AMAZing; but it sure wasn't bad not even ""not good"". You may also find the interior to be a bit drab dark and old fashioned.... Doesn't appear to have been updated since maybe '85...? And the giant  flatscreen TV above the bar is just about as misplaced in an italian restaurant as one can imagine. It's like WTH?

The texture of the gnocchi was just right, soft but not too soft. The sauce was so tasty I overdid it and ate the whole plate in one go.I've gotten my dinner to go both times because it was late and I was tired. The owner and staff were welcoming and chatted with me while I waited, and poured me a glass of their house tea without me even asking.

My mother in law and I looked at that menu while she was finishing her nails and immediately decided it would be a great idea, plus the babe in my belly had me craving the salmon and veggies meal. La Taverna is decorated beautifully with cork top seats that were perfectly incorporated into the rustic decor. The waitress immediately served us water and was ready to take our order since we were already set with our choices! The meals come with soup or salad. I opted for salad since I wasn't in the mood for soup but definitely had to taste my sister in laws since it smelled so good. The soup of the day was lentil soup and it really had a delicious flavor served in a hearty portion. We ordered four apps to start and had we known they were so huge we would have definitely shared meals! First served was the caprese salad, next was the Caesar salad, followed by the garlic bread, and then finally the fried artichoke each was only $6-7 each. All of the apps we tried were perfectly seasoned and delightful that even though we were trying to save room for our meals, we finished every bite. I really loved that the artichokes had a crispy breaded coating and were served with kalamata olives. When our meals arrived we were so stuffed but the food looked so good we had to at least take a few bites. My sister in law and I ordered the grilled salmon and veggies which came with spiced rub roasted potatoes, roasted carrots and zucchini. This meal was only $15, which not only was well portioned but a good deal for a seafood dish. Every bite was heaven sent and I had to take the leftovers home which I very much enjoyed the next day for lunch. My mother in law ordered chicken fettuccine a truly exquisite dish, I sneaked a few bites when she was in the bathroom:) It had the perfect amount of creamy sauce and the chicken was grilled and seasoned nicely.The only thing I would say is that I was heartbroken when I asked if they held private parties and was disappointed to hear they do not.

La Taverna,5341,946 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,7771,"Coming here was a bit of a leap for me - reviewers have been pretty divided, agreeing on only two things: it's cheap, and there's one waitress. I can confirm both of these.The decor was warm and welcoming, a bit dimly lit, but nice. Strangely, the place was just about empty when  came in shortly after 8 - the lone waitress looked up when I entered and seemed confused at first, as if she wasn't quite sure what I was doing there. In a few minutes, I'd feel the same, but I'm getting ahead of myself.I'm seated and brought a menu pretty cooly - an attitude that would prevail all dinner. Just shy of rude, but definitely not friendly. I went for the chicken parm, which came with house salad and spaghetti. So, bit by bit:The bread was hard, like it'd been cut a few hours ago and was left out to wait for me. The salad was alright, but there was something very off about the dressing... I'm not a big salad guy, but I know when something's too weird to eat, so I left most of it. The spaghetti was alright, the chicken parm was a bit bland, a bit overcooked, but equally passable. None of my plates were taken away until I'd finished the entree though - I was left to reach around old plates to get things, and to use my salad fork with my chicken.I had a one star review pretty well set in my mind until dessert, when the staff member working at the bar (Not a full bar mind) came by to wait on me insead, since the other waitress wasn't going very far very fast.

La Taverna,5341,946 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,26841,"**update** I did manage to finally dine in and the experience was far better. Short and sweet: if you want inexpensive, tasty Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere where you do linger over wine, then go here. It's a cute place to have a meal.(Note: I have not dined in this place;  only asked for takeout and delivery). It pains me to give only 1 star. Their menu has cheap, delicious-sounding items, especially the fried artichoke leaves. But the food has always arrived lukewarm or cold and lacking in flavor; either over-salted or bland. The fried artichoke leaves are inconsistent: they can be either very small and heavy on the fried breading or are they a decent size and succulent. The last straw occurred when we ordered food to go one cold winter night. The order was spaghetti and meatballs, fried artichoke leaves and a small Vegetariana pizza (spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, kalamata olives, onions). We were told, at 8:20pm, it would be a half hour wait. When going back to pick it up, we were told that 1) nothing was ready and 2) the Vegetariana pizza was broken and had to be redone. They offered to deliver this to us in 20 minutes. We took the one entree that was eventually ready (the original 30 minutes now turned into 60) and waited for the pizza. And waited. Finally we called the restaurant. They assured us the delivery guy was around the corner. He arrives, but informs us the pizza is now cold. (How? We thought it was freshly  made!) We take it, because it is now 10pm and we're starving. I put the pizza in the oven to reheat it. And realize that my Vegetariana pizza is a margherita with olives and feta. After all that, we got the wrong pizza. The only decent thing about that night's dinner was that we lucked out with the fried artichoke leaves. And they did refund us all the money. However, I will never order from La Taverna again. I doubt I will dine at the restaurant.

I asked the waitress about the missing potatoes and she said sorry and that they don't have any more potatoes. This is the reason why I did not give them a five stars. Waitress did not tell me in advance, but had the nerve to give me my entree without saying anything. So if I did not ask about it, she would assume I would forget. However, the waitress then asked if I would like more vegetables and I said okay. She takes my plate to the back and in less than 2 minutes, returned with 4 small pieces of roasted potatoes and said there were some potatoes left somehow. I did not like the roasted potatoes, it was super greasy. One other thing, the steak was small in proportion to the big plate it was served on.

Not that there's anything wrong with chuckie cheese pizza, but when I order a margherita from an italian restaurant, I expect good crust, big, fresh pieces of basil, the good mozz (the wet kind), olive oil and some areas not covered by the mozz where the fresh tomato sauce can bake a little. This rubbery cheese (not mozz) covered the entire thing, the middle was wet and soft, and I got a couple thin strips of basil on a couple slices. I've had better pizza in bedstuy.The gnocci was even worse. I love good gnocci because its like soft pillows of goodness. I was craving some and thought, ""how could an italian place mess that up?"" and I was so disappointed.When you overcook gnocci, the middle starts to get hard.

La Taverna,5341,946 Manhattan Ave,Brooklyn,11222.0,193463,"It's cheap that's as much as I can say about the place. You walk into a very empty unwelcoming space with the workers behind the bar staring at you wondering by the lack of customers whether or not you will fight through the urge like prior potential patrons to fly off else where. This should have been the cue for me but my girlfriend wanted to go here because the place had such great reviews now that I have read over all of them I have noticed; given the tight knit community that is Greenpoint, that most of the 4 and 5 star ratings came from friends and family or people who have never had an average meal at Carabas, Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden. But I know from past experiences that cheap does not always translates to delicious and became wary from the very beginning. Soups should be made daily and I could tell by the color of the lintel soup that this was reheated from the night before and not made that evening. I mean hello it's lentil soup people you can make that at 2 and have it ready for dinner service by 5. The bruschetta and grilled asparagus made me feel sad. The prior should open up you pallet it was just ok. Unfortunately they only served two pieces on the dish and I wanted more because the asparagus only did one thing which was make my urine smell when I woke up this morning. The asparagus was served aldente, impossible to cut with the knife they gave me and another piece was a floppy former existence of the near raw piece I had tried eating earlier.The calamari was flash fried perfectly, not rubbery however the sauce was uninspiring definitely store bought not made fresh and it gave me little hope that if I ordered another basic seafood dish there was potential for it being average but little more than that. Afraid to order anything chicken because of my raw asparagus experience I went that route. Instead of ordering a bottle of wine, chugging it and dragging my girlfriend out like the place was on fire I stayed.Honestly the whole experience was a nightmare with rushed service and plates too big for the damn tables. I felt like I was eating at a trough with the rest of the pigs.Having taken culinary classes in the past, having dozens of friends who work on lines for Top Chef winners, Iron Chefs and have been participants in Chopped and sitting at national chains as well as but not limited the top Italian New York restaurants like Becco's or the pizzeria Russ' down the block on Manhattan Avenue, the owners need to go to these places and hire a real chef and simplify the menu because if you can't get vegetables right I don't expect you can do something like my next dish. There was no damn love! Shake Shack spends more attention to detail!!!I ordered the seafood risotto for my next entree and I shit you not the risotto cam out in a clumped ball on not just my plate but everyone who ordered. I thought it was a test shooting for a re-imagining  of ""Oliver"" because it was fucking gruel. The plating looked like they thought I was a pig. I picked around my food the best I could eating the clams and mussels because the shrimp and scallops WERE RAW!!!! FUCK SAKE YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOMEONE SICK SERVING RAW FOOD YOU GOD DAMN IDIOTS!!! IT DISGUSTED ME AND I FILLED MYSELF ON BREAK AND OIL UNTIL THE CHECK CAME AND I RAN OUT WITH GIRLFRIEND IN TOW. I WENT TO 7-ELEVEN FOR 6 TAQUITOS AND SODA TO WASH THE FLAVORS (OR LACK THERE OF) OUT OF MY MOUTH.

Sure, they've raised their prices recently, but it's still an amazing deal. The lunch special especially. The portions are perfectly sized as well. As for the dishes, every chicken and pasta dish I've had has been amazing. I recommend the chicken marsala. The tomato soup is a great starter for it. The pizza is a bit meh and the steak is kind of gross, but everything else that I've had has been quite tasty. Still, there's a dish there for everyone.

Wifey started with the fried artichoke and since it's something she loves, I was surprised to hear that the dish was flavorless. In fact she said it was one of the worst fried artichoke dishes she's ever had. A big bummer because I thought it looked pretty good (although I like almost anything fried). She then ordered gnocchi and it was so salty that she literally had to force it down and could only get through half of the dish. This is a woman who really likes salt so that says something. I ordered the salmon and it was cooked well, but was also super salty. I was still able to enjoy it (to an extent), but the over-salty taste made it challenging. The potato slices were SUPER dry and pretty awful. The steamed vegetables were the best part of this dish which is not what you're hoping for when you go for Italian.On the plus side the bread was very good (crunch outside, soft light inside). Nice waitress who played cool music and was accomodating when wifey asked to add the spinach sauce from another dish to this one. Although she did over-share a bit about how she would have to relay that to the cooks so they didn't get mad. I also enjoy the decor/vibe (especially the chairs that look like they were hand-made by some little old man living in the Alps).It seems that a large majority of the good reviews focus on how nice the owner was.

La Tapatia Deli Grocery,5342,254 Knickerbocker Ave,Brooklyn,11237.0,186,"I've been going here for about 5 years and the family that runs the place is about as nice as possible. Their menu is pretty varied (tacos, tortas, tamales, huaraches, pozole, picadas, etc), but their vegetarian/vegan options are pretty limited, so my go-to has always been a plate of bean and avocado tacos with onions, cilantro, and tomatoes. They bring you red and green salsas, both of which are delicious and would enhance any meal.The restaurant is tiny and has three tables, each of which could seat about 4 people (very snuggly), if there were that many chairs. The wife/mother appears to do all of the cooking and there's one griddle so if there is another family there, you may be waiting 20 minutes for your tacos.The flavor of the food is excellent - very authentic and very fresh. I've taken dozens of friends here, including visitors from all over the world (including my Mexican in-laws), and they all consider the food to be top notch and super affordable. As for the ambiance, I am fine w/ a very no-frills environment and I speak Spanish so I'm fine that there isn't a proper menu with descriptions or prices, but I think that environment can be off-putting for people who don't speak Spanish or who aren't used to going to restaurants like this. Also, while the tacos and tortas are good, they don't have many sides to have a complete meal. I got a side of beans last time but rice wasn't an option.

I was already in love.  I ordered the cabrit, he ordered the fritaille and we admired the artwork on the wall while we waited.  We got our food in the expected 20 minutes and our greedy selves hopped in the car, drove around the corner, parked and feasted.  OMFG the food was soooo good, everything was perfection, the pikliz was phenomenal, the cabrit was seasoned and cooked perfectly, his fritaille was on point.  I came again recently except I called ahead and I was in and out in 3 minutes only cause there was a line.  They're cash only which I hate but I'm willing to carry cash for them. Besides the food the service is great, the 1st time I went my friend ordered cause he speaks creole fluently, when I went solo I appreciated that they didn't act like they didn't know what I was talking about as I spoke english and my broken creole.  They've definitely earned a place on my caribbean food line up",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,8.10000038147,"critics,someone,food,area,area,area,area,food,food,tastes,Haitian,states,food,food,cash,food,food,food,neighborhood,seating area,friend,everything,food,food,places,fritaille,cabrit,window,spot,walk,side,anything,sign,order,love,artwork,wall,selves,pikliz,way,Haitian,caribbean food,service,line,lot,cash,food,Jamaican,creole,creole,place,fritaille,cabrit,corner,car,point,english","1,1,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,2,6,7,7","0.185400247574,0.157448291779,0.0739284679294,0.0576010905206,0.0576010905206,0.0576010905206,0.0576010905206,0.0355623103678,0.0355623103678,0.0273278951645,0.0147341787815,0.0144228050485,0.0135377813131,0.0116979852319,0.00968455150723,0.00912267062813,0.00912267062813,0.00831398367882,0.00734236789867,0.00705720670521,0.00640932191163,0.0062968628481,0.00615960266441,0.00610806420445,0.00563027244061,0.00511433696374,0.00511433696374,0.00491510564461,0.00491510564461,0.00491510564461,0.00491510564461,0.00490551674739,0.00490551674739,0.00448920531198,0.00448161642998,0.00447493325919,0.00447493325919,0.00446896348149,0.00445257406682,0.00444135069847,0.00434905663133,0.00426220195368,0.00407225033268,0.00397810293362,0.00380739429966,0.00380368344486,0.00323783094063,0.00291711045429,0.00263119442388,0.00263119442388,0.00262889382429,0.00199680938385,0.0016719866544,0.00146451219916,0.00146451219916,0.00146274303552,0.00136259919964"

Listen, I moved from the Stuy alright. There's a buzz of millennials that just fits my aesthetic. But Bedstuy is way too expensive now. Back to review...So I walked in on a Sunday between brunch hours where apparently they are closed but the quick order window wasn't. I was told they still serving breakfast, I didn't mind one bit since I had nothing in my stomach all morning. The restaurant was empty and lights were low as they were setting up for lunch. I saw an middle aged woman sitting at the corner checking out papers and numbers. This cued me into, ohhhh that's the owner.  Mind you, I've never had Haitian food in my life! I'd repeat that for emphasis if I need to. LolI asked if I can sit at the dinning area since I did realized I was more hungrier than expected. Ordering:I'm Trini so I stuck to what I knew. I ordered the Herring breakfast with Maiz and a homemade lemonade to the side. The food took a little bit to come out so I made conversation with the owner. Which she introduced herself as Ms. Augustine. She told me she's owed the place for 20 something years. I was amazed. Most restaurants go belly up after 3. This got me even more excited to taste this food because 20 something years is a milestone especially for this industry. You must be doing something right! The food came out and the staff went the extra mile to give me house made hot sauce. It was a meal fit for a Queen; like myself. The herring came with boiled Plantains, lettuce, sweet potato (the white one), steamed carrot, and a boiled egg on the side. The maiz or cornmeal was brown. It was different and I was not use to this breakfast but it tasted so good! But I'm always gamed to try new foods. With one bite of the herring and plantain, I was instantly time hopped and transported back to Trinidad as a young girl; sitting at the breakfast table with family. The flavors were well balanced and perfectly seasoned. I don't know how the kitchen staff pull it off with the different ingredients the states have to offer, and still have the dish tasting like you've never left your homeland. That astounds me! Overall the food is excellent and I'd definitely come back for more. For 7 bucks it's so worth it. You get your bang for your buck!

But as a business owner myself i can understand what they go through when it comes to foot traffic during the weekends. And its sad that HAITIAN PEOPLE dont know what patience is, they always wanna act up at a black own business but go to these WHITE restaurants and dont give the WHITE PEOPLE pressure for their own food when they wait 2 hours plus for a fuckin table at red lobster, olive gardenx or whatever WHITE own restaurant. BLACK PEOPLE r funny people and always wanna play the black card when white people has something to say. As a black person myself ya black ppl that give other black people a hard time in their own business is a joke and a disgrace to the black community. BLACK PEOPLE are also funny cuz ya BLACK PEOPLE dont ever go to any white restaurant and ask whats on their menu, ya look at the menu and order what ya want but whenbit comes to BLACK PEOPLE ya wanna ask whats on the menu when the fuckin menu is in front of ya damn face.

La Union Restaurant Chifa Peruano,5346,91-18 Corona Ave,Queens,11368.0,19404,"I had high expectations after reading reviews in the edible Queens magazine and on the Serious Eats website and was disappointed. The service was a little slow, especially for a Friday night. There were 2-3 other tables there. I've never had chinese-peruvian food and didn't know what to expect, maybe I didn't order the right thing? I ordered the Egg Drop Soup (one article stated it was egg drop soup on crack). It was definitely interesting, with roast pork and dark-meat chicken in it, vermicelli glass noodles, scallions, and cabbage. But the overall flavor of the soup seemed somewhere in-between and lacking. Same for the Chi jau kay that was recommended. It took a long time waiting for this dish. The chicken was breaded and cooked perfectly, but the light brown sauce that it was sitting on top of was neither too salty or sweet. It seemed slightly flavored by soy sauce, but nothing that called to mind the rich flavors of latin cooking- or chinese actually.My friend ordered the pork chops with tamarind sauce. What she got was sliced roast bbq (chinese style) pork with a sort of red sweet & sour sauce on top and peach halves, sauteed with pea pods. Not what we expected, and no tamarind flavor. I'm wondering if they ran out of pork chops. The fried plantains were good, and their green sauce that accompanies each meal was Awesome- just spicy enough, but very flavorful. I wish the food was the same.They ran out of the chica moradao, I was looking forward to it.

La Troca del Sabor,5348,N 4th St Bedford Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3753,"So last night I went into Williamsburg looking for cheap food that would be somewhat filling too. I searched Yelp and found that there were two taco truck/cart places a few blocks from me. I decided that I might as well try them both seeing as how they both got good reviews and were literally several blocks from each other. The first place was La Troca del Sabor which was a big truck. The second place was a stand inside cart called Taco Morelos. Look for my review on Taco Morelos.La Troca del Sabor is actually on the cheap and inexpensive side for tacos. They were $2.25 each. One of the quick tips I read boasted that the chicken was amazing and the beef was just okay. So I decided to get a chicken taco and passed up the beef for a pork taco.They came packed on this paper container (the type you get cheese fries on at Nathan's) with two pieces of lime and wrapped in foil. It was dark out so I couldn't really even tell what was in it. It looked like a big mess. My very first complaint is that the two pieces of lime were actually one wedge of lime cut in half the short way. That's kind of cheap. It made it worse that there was barely any juice coming out of them. My second complaint is that once I picked up the Chicken Taco, half the filling immediately fell out the other end and landed on top and the side of my Pork Taco. My third complaint is that the soft taco shell was very tough and chewy. It was so bad that at one point I just wanted to eat the filling and leave the shell.These tacos were quite messy. Luckily the lady gave me a good amount of napkins. They weren't all that special. The taco shell was tough and the filling was just okay at best. The chicken wasn't amazing as I was expecting. The pork was somewhat better but still nothing special.After I got home later that night I came down with a bad case of FOOD POISONING. I don't know which place I got it from so I'll just have to include this section in both reviews. I've puked all night and the world seemed to be spinning.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,19090,"I rarely make a bad review. Perhaps if we got to taste the menu this may change. Sunday evening I had been planning to take my fiancee to this newly michelin starred restaurant, so much so I thought i would book a month in advance in order to make sure we had a good evening. I also mentioned to the hostess i called that it was her Birthday. The second we walked in the door I knew something was off when there was nobody to greet us, staff too consumed with the half full restaurant to take notice of a happy couple arriving. I walk up to the servers chatting to each other and I let them know i had a reservation for 2 for 8pm. Without even looking at a reservation book one of them just said "" take one of the two tables at the back"" and points in that direction, and instead of taking us to the table, returns to the conversation with the other staff member. As we walk over to the table at the back we realize that there is no air conditioning, and the restaurant is a solid 85 degrees inside. My fiancee turns to me and says she can't bear the heat and perhaps we eat outside, since we can see some tables out the back door. ""We don't serve outside"" was the response... ""Well how about the tables nearer the door at the front which are empty and seems cooler"" I reply"" Those tables are already reserved... perhaps the bar?"" says the serverMy fiancee and I look at each other in disbelief. We both know they haven't even looked up our reservation and would have no idea if those tables are reserved or not! Before I even mention that it's her birthday and we've had a reservation for a month, I take a look down at a guests meal of bland looking vegetables and a dry rack of not so sucking pig's back ... we walk out... No one should be treated like that especially at an institution which should pride itself on service, An apology will be wasted ..We had a fantastic night at a Brooklyn favourite Chez Moi on Atlantic.

However, I can say that they all tasted amazing. A special shout-out to the tomato in sizzling cheese, served with charred bread. The best thing I had, though, was definitely the chicken - what WAS that sauce? It was subtle but added so perfectly to the meat, which was slow roasted and tender.I don't really drink, but my coworkers had two gin and tonics, a vodka martini, and some wine. They all said the alcohol was wonderful.Desserts were varied and interesting: the tart with rich hints of sweetness, the almond cake almost overpowering with its tart, sugary, chewy consistency, and the custard - such a light but interesting flavor. I also had a cappuccino which was delicious and comforting at the end of a meal.The staff was pleasant and on-point, perfectly describing each dish, always keeping water glasses filled and taking away empty plates.

The paella was absolutely beautifully presented. It's such a shame that other dishes were so disappointing! Drinks: Cocktails were weak for my taste, but that's just my preference. It's a shame that the sparkling wine (a type of Cava) I ordered wasn't really fizzy (maybe the bottle was open for too long?)The baked fish of the day for example (a Dorade) was not fresh and some bites were fishy enough to make me cringe. Dorade is not a fishy fish, and this should never be the case. I eat a wide variety of seafood pretty regularly so this was definitely not subjective! For $29 I expect at the very least, fresh quality! The green tahini deviled eggs were okay, but nothing special (I guess they were out of quail eggs, and subbed in regular eggs). For dessert, I ordered the olive oil ice cream which was unique and delicious. It was very quiet as it was a  Monday evening. No complaints on the service; dishes also came out very fast. The one sort of strange thing though was that our tapas came out before our drinks. Kind of strange timing.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4193,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I WILDLY enjoyed my first experience at La Vara, about a month after they opened.  It was a birthday dinner there (for myself) and the meal was delicious and memorable in all the best ways.  Exquisite execution of unique dishes and ingredients.  A quality meal and great service.  I very much looked forward to returning.Fast-forward to NYE 2014.  I tried to book La Vara for a NYE dinner, about two months in advance of the date.  They accepted my reservation.  I sat smug and looked forward to the meal.  About a week later, they left me a voicemail saying they decided not to be open that night, and, oh well...sorry!  Admittedly, I landed on my feet with a reservation at Brooklyn Fare for NYE, but still, why take orders for a special dining night and then decide to close?  That was a head scratcher.Fast-forward to last week.  My fiancé and I are moving out of the neighborhood and I had been telling him about my amazing La Vara meal for so long I thought I should treat him to a dinner there before we upped sticks entirely.  The meal was 'meh' for both of us.  The portions have become ridiculously small for the price.  We ordered three smaller plates and two larger, and then ordered a third larger dish to try and achieve that happy-full feeling.  Of the smaller plates, the fried artichokes stood out, but mainly because nothing else did.  The biggest offender was the anchovy dish that arrived with 4 slivers of anchovy and 3 pieces of bread to eat them with.  For a table of 2.  I mean, come on La Vara.  You couldn't have sprung for that 4th disc of baguette?  Pitiful.  Our third smaller plate was the anchovy dish which looked like a puddle of watery tomato and a few headless fish drowning in it's lifeless waters. At this point I was hoping for a miracle with the other dishes, but it never happened.For larger plates, we ordered the rabbit loin (which was tender, but the accompanying compote/salad was overly sweet).  The Red Spanish prawns (TWO PRAWNS.  TWO.  ONE - TWO.  THAT'S IT.) were delicious, but there were TWO.   And, the pasta paella.  They use a matchstick shape of pasta that looked (and tasted) a bit like Lipton Cup O'Soup.  Not that I think they use this there, but you could basically get the same mouth feel and flavor sensation buying a packet of the soup and added a couple of chewy clams and the teeniest sliver of calamari.We did not stay for dessert as most of the options were dull and predictable.  We saw one of the fig cakes being brought out to a neighboring table, but it looked like little more than a big Fig Newton with a splodge of cream on it.  Five stars for our server, who was exceedingly friendly and pleasant.  2 stars for the food.",3.0 star rating,"Bronx, NY",3,0,0.0,17.6000003815,"reviewers,birthday dinner,anchovy dish,some,experience,anchovy dish,meal,dishes,meal,service,ways,execution,ingredients,La Vara,fiancé,puddle,meal,dinner,NYE 2014,meal,reservation,matchstick shape,advance,miracle,meal,dish,plates,plates,voicemail,dinner,cream,orders,prawns,reservation,dining night,anchovy,feeling,head,slivers,table,feet,sticks,neighborhood,both,price,portions,nothing,artichokes,bread,pieces,baguette,disc,tomato,pasta,sliver,mouth feel,pasta paella,bit,clams,couple,soup,flavor sensation,Brooklyn Fare,one,table,stars,server,stars,packet,calamari.,dessert,options,fig cakes,splodge,food,dishes,plates,Lipton Cup O'Soup,salad,waters,fish,compote,rabbit loin,Fig Newton,most,Red Spanish","1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,4,7,7,6,7,4,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,3","0.230854958296,0.0912897586823,0.0454192943871,0.0397108830512,0.0392153151333,0.0355267301202,0.0324236378074,0.0270453765988,0.0269475262612,0.0214699860662,0.0189602263272,0.018863407895,0.018863407895,0.0172803066671,0.0149990404025,0.0103884516284,0.0102280294523,0.00898305978626,0.00846620462835,0.00819719117135,0.00815549120307,0.00783578958362,0.00715021742508,0.00701224664226,0.00687236944214,0.00685297278687,0.00645359233022,0.00644831825048,0.00626726169139,0.00601325230673,0.00570412632078,0.00558442156762,0.00550243956968,0.00548220984638,0.00548220984638,0.00547867547721,0.00545411650091,0.00510425446555,0.00498325377703,0.00497964536771,0.00479665864259,0.00478558801115,0.00478558801115,0.00478073628619,0.00477624824271,0.00477624824271,0.00476817274466,0.00476817274466,0.00436002574861,0.00436002574861,0.00435105385259,0.00435105385259,0.00434580119327,0.00369801535271,0.0036964265164,0.0036964265164,0.00323682837188,0.00323538878001,0.00323399831541,0.00323399831541,0.00323399831541,0.00323399831541,0.00283980788663,0.00255810865201,0.00255810865201,0.0025570790749,0.0025570790749,0.0025560813956,0.00254164100625,0.00223893299699,0.00223893299699,0.00223893299699,0.00223800214007,0.00223800214007,0.00223622843623,0.002044320805,0.00192503945436,0.00191515590996,0.00169953482691,0.00142382236663,0.00142382236663,0.0014230197994,0.0014230197994,0.00132462172769,0.000969338871073,0.000841724511702"

It consisted of mint, arugula and a delicious lime-date dressing. The meat was succulent and perfect.Green pepper and baby shrimp salad- delightful small pieces with an avocado sauce.

It's really just meh-to-ok. I came on a Saturday night and was really happy/lucky to get a table. Our waitperson was friendly friendly and  food came out quick. The problem was the portions were psychotically small (even for tapas) and mostly not very good. We had the famous artichokes that tasted like street fair food - greasy and not much flavor. And a chick pea spinach ""stew"" that really truly tasted like hospital food - limp and swampy and generally very unappealing.  The eggplant was very good, however, as was the flat bread.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,193909,"This was the best meal I had during a week in New York, and probably the best so far this year.A group of four, we arrived after a gruelling hour wait drinking possibly the best cocktails I've ever had at Red Gravy nearby and crumpled into our table at half nine on a Wednesday. The size of the portions and the size of the group meant we could sample a fairly good selection of the menu. We had about 2-3 tapas each, all shared, which was absolutely more than enough (I've seen other Yelpers complaining that the portions meant you needed to order about 8 each, I find this slightly terrifying). Some portions were larger than others, but most were of the traditional saucer sized variety.There were a healthy amount of specials available, all explained and recommended by our friendly Spanish waitress and we tried a few of these. Steamed ramps appeared in a brown paper bag we had to cut open, accompanied by a rich romesco sauce, the American take on the traditional Catalan calçot dish. Migas (of the Spanish, not tex mex variety) were a deliciously moreish and large plate of crispy fried Chorizo, breadcrumbs and caramelized onions. I decided against ordering the berenjenas con miel, fried aubergines with cheese and honey, after an underwhelming experience with the same in other tapas places. When my Dad ordered them, I demolished them. The aubergine had been peeled and sliced into batons, the sauce, a mix of manchego and a creamy Mozzarella like cheese whose name escapes me, was the perfect blend of sweet, tangy and creamy.Each dish that came out seemed better than the last. Alcachofa, fried artichokes with anchovy aioli were just the right mix of crispy and melting, the aioli having enough anchovy to give it a bite without being so much as to put off someone like me who doesn't really like them. The cordero, cumin roasted lamb, tasted like a confit, with an addictive zingy preserved lemon and date condiment. Pan amb tomaca, the traditional tomato bread had a twist of mojama (air cured tuna) and nori. Escalavida, a traditional vegetable stew was paired with a light tahini sauce, an unusual take that combined richness with the fresh, lush taste of the vegetables. The croquettas were the only unremarkable dish of the night, being absolutely fine, but not the best I've ever hadWe finished off, although by now thoroughly full, with two desserts. Olive oil ice-cream with sea salt tasted exactly like its ingredients, in the best possible way, though was not to my taste to be honest. The other dessert, a special, involved an elegant and light black sesame macaron and many other things I can't remember.While the prices range from low to high, the bill for all the food with wine and sherry for four people came to a pretty reasonable (by New York standards) $230 which is worth noting as many reviews said you'd need to spend at least 100 a head to manage here. We spent the rest of our time in New York deliberating whether to return but never did. There is a danger of attempting to recreate the amazing experience of the first time trying something wonderful on holiday which can never really be repeated. But if I lived in Brooklyn, I would come here as often as my paycheck allowed.",5.0 star rating,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",4,1,0.40000000596,10.1999998093,"meal,best,group,cocktails,table,half,New York,tapas,portions,Red Gravy,group,size,selection,menu,size,dish,dessert,anchovy,bill,someone,variety.,waitress,sauce,portions,others,specials,Migas,Spanish,romesco sauce,calçot dish,holiday,tex mex variety,breadcrumbs,cheese,aubergines,experience,cheese,mix,aubergine,anchovy aioli,tomato bread,blend,aioli,crispy,mix,tomaca,tahini sauce,ramps,brown paper bag,Chorizo,onions,honey,tapas places,same,berenjenas con,name,batons,Mozzarella,last,manchego,artichokes,few,paycheck,tuna,melting,cordero,lamb,confit,lemon,zingy,condiment,nori,twist,mojama,air,Yelpers,Olive oil ice-cream,portions,taste,way,standards,special,macaron,sesame,things,prices,food,wine,sherry,people,bite,amount,most,Catalan,American,Dad,danger,Pan,something,experience,head,rest,reviews,dish,vegetables,taste,desserts,vegetable stew,sea salt,ingredients,Brooklyn,best,Alcachofa,Escalavida,hadWe,richness,croquettas","7,7,1,6,7,2,2,6,5,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,1,2,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,1,7,1","0.150835737586,0.054411765188,0.0434073843062,0.0380230695009,0.0380230695009,0.0380230695009,0.0287403929979,0.0239348281175,0.0227798577398,0.0225854609162,0.0207277163863,0.0207277163863,0.0181439854205,0.0181439854205,0.0175892394036,0.0162598881871,0.0156825296581,0.0126931555569,0.0107663543895,0.00825424306095,0.00785756576806,0.00785756576806,0.00741948792711,0.00735370535403,0.00687539670616,0.00687539670616,0.006768301595,0.0064646108076,0.006260168273,0.00581649458036,0.00549428770319,0.0052783107385,0.0052783107385,0.00526800984517,0.00526800984517,0.00526800984517,0.00525125861168,0.00525125861168,0.00525125861168,0.00524425180629,0.00510120205581,0.00483343657106,0.00479905446991,0.00479905446991,0.00479905446991,0.00478797778487,0.00472808163613,0.00462885899469,0.00462885899469,0.00461817486212,0.00461817486212,0.00460916059092,0.00460916059092,0.00460916059092,0.00460916059092,0.00459450203925,0.00459450203925,0.00459450203925,0.00459450203925,0.00459450203925,0.00458837067708,0.004468774423,0.00432619685307,0.00429666042328,0.00419879518449,0.00419372553006,0.00419372553006,0.00419372553006,0.00419372553006,0.00419372553006,0.00419372553006,0.0041891024448,0.0041891024448,0.0041891024448,0.0041891024448,0.00408608745784,0.00398826692253,0.00374313397333,0.00356701598503,0.00312074040994,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00311818788759,0.00298169930466,0.00297853630036,0.00297853630036,0.00274032750167,0.00274032750167,0.00272404402494,0.00264036655426,0.00247987848707,0.00246380222961,0.00246380222961,0.00215870095417,0.002157041803,0.00200052862056,0.00172147818375,0.00156713847537,0.00156713847537,0.00156566605438,0.00137098703999,0.00136850064155,0.00136850064155,0.00127487303689,0.00121518271044,0.00117608648725,0.00081137259258,0.000810610130429,0.000691074470524,0.000592922384385"

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,3706,"I wanted to share a quick cautious moment about eating at this establishment -- and maybe it's me. But after reviewing other reader comments and having visited the restaurant here are my humble thoughts. 1. The plates are delicious. 2. They are small. Sort of like having - Spanish sushi and or Chinese Dimsum. 2. If you happen to have a large appetite, prepare to spend or go else where. I was also wondering about the reviewers, I felt the honesty was a little canned. But to each his own. One reviewer, my comments:GARBANZOS FRITOS: La Vara spiced fried chickpeas * 3 - really small plate, I would order two, if your company is more than two.PATATAS BRAVAS: EQP's rough cut crispy potatoes with spicy alioli * 6 - again, food as a teaser, order two. MOJE: layered salad of imported tuna, olives, endive, Marcona almonds * 14 - and I can go on. CUCHIFRITO: crispy lamb hash with poached eggs, ajo cabiñil sauce * 11EL QUIM: local squid and crispy morcilla with broken eggs, Boqueria style * 11 -  and on. ALCACHOFAS Y FAVAS: olive oil braised artichoke and fava bean stew, poached eggs * 12 and on. I will admit very sexy drinks. Again, this is a $65 - $75 dollar per person night - if you have the dollars, prepare to spend. And, you may still be hungry at the end of the night!This comment gets to me: ""Take note, Buttermilk Channel, Frankie's, Talde, and the rest of you overhyped restaurants  - this place is the real deal, and you should all be taking notes. - Wow, this is rich!Another ebullent quote: ""I love small plates. With a few adventurous people, you can try such an array of flavors. La Vara is a very small restaurant. We got in just under the wire; we waited about 20-30 minutes, with later arrives quoted times of 1 hr or more."" - Again, does this person get out much, it should be small and pricey. Here's another gushing one:""If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd come here all the time. I'm from the New York area and this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

Don't expect to find another paella bar: the cuisine is more Moorish than Valencian, and it is outstanding. Here's what to get:Croquettas: perhaps the best we've ever, ever had. A must.Suckling Pig: if they have it, it would be criminal NOT to order it. Don't even think about ordering anything else unless you get the pig.Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil: imagine duck confit, but with lamb. This was the tastiest, most succulent lamb meat I've ever had. Crunchy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.Anything with langostinos (as a side, they don't give you many).You can probably skip dessert - it was the only part of the meal we weren't thrilled about. The homemade ice-cream was lacking in flavor (and sugar); it was also icy rather than creamy, probably due to the low sugar and/or fat content.The best seats are at the bar, which is wide enough and comfortable that you don't need a table. You also get the added benefit of observing pure magic, courtesy of Pablo (your bartender/waiter).There is a significant obstacle you need to overcome before enjoying any of this deliciousness, and it is... well, you aren't the only one who is hoping to enjoy it. Their reservation policy is logical but annoying (only for parties of 4+, and if you're hoping to score one on Fri/Sat, book 2-3 weeks in advance). And really, if you decide to check this place out on a weekend, expect 45 min to 1:30 hr wait. Then, if/when you do end up at a table, ask for earplugs.

The lamb meatballs with mint yogurt were good and the chorizo with breadcrumbs was alright but nothing blew me away yet. Until out final dish.The fideua, valencian style noodle paella, shrimp, squid, clams and alioli, was so damn good. That is something which should have been on GQ's top 50 dishes in the country.

Eating inside feels very much like siting in someone's home and is welcoming as surrounding tables could easily, and often do, carry on conversations. The kitchen and bar are easily visible and their compactness is almost baffling with the creations that are pumped out.  Our meal started with a glass of the white and red sangria which were perfectly boozy and sweet to get our palates prepared. Regrettably we chose a few plates that were fried (chickpeas) and although they were delicious they also filled our bellies quickly. As a result, I was only able to sample the suckling pig which was a tad fattier that I would have preferred but was overall one of the richest dish I have had.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,10220,"My hubby & I were lucky enough to get a table at 8:30pm on a Friday night without having to wait. On the recommendation of our waitress, we started with a bottle of the Vina Sastre which was as amazing as she described-full-bodied with a hint of sweetness. We shared 7 different plates- each was unique and bursting with flavor. We started with the croqueta because really, who could resist? Sticking with the fried theme, next we had the berenjena con miel--  mm that eggplant paired with sweet honey and salty cheese, so good! We also had the mallorcan flatbread which was good, but nothing out of this world and another chorizo dish which had the perfect amount of kick. We had the suckling pig which was a special of the night- honestly, it wasn't as great as I'd hoped and didn't have quite as much flavor as the other dishes. The chicken asado was moist and bursting with flavor. The standout dish, was the Remojon which we ordered on recommendation from our waitress(the wine was delicious, so we knew she wouldn't steer us wrong). The ingredients in the Remojon were unique and at first, sound kind of odd together- but were so insanely delicious, I could eat this every day-- the citrusy salt cod paired so well with the pistachios/pistachio oil, egg and pomegranate.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,75510,"I stopped in last night to celebrate my belated birthday dinner with my date.  I was torn between a 4-5 stars but the overall experience and service was great! Decor: very clean and elegant, hardwood floors and white walls, ample bar space to sit down and several tables outside. We sat outside on the back patio there were only 3-4 tables. Granted it was 86 degrees the whole day the back was shaded by a huge tree and the temperature by 6pm dropped. Beverages: SANGRIA, mind blown I had one glass and was wobbling out of there. Date had two glasses and had to drive to Beantown. I couldn't imagine how I felt so loopy.. They put gin in their sangria along with sugar and apples and lemon. Well I knew from that point on I was going to like this place. Food: We had one Fritos and two calientes. Mind you I'm not a big fish eater and majority of this menu was fish or had some in it. We started with the alachofa ($9) fried artichoke with anchovy alioli. So fingerlicking good. Perfectly crispy, not oily. The alioli was smooth, not fishy, didn't have an after taste and a little zesty. So last time my date and I got together he had goat tacos so we were still on the kick and went with the Gurullos. Loved the handmade murcian pasta. Yes the texture might be acquired for some because it's slimey. But there was a lot of flavor in the ground goat. I wouldn't call this a summer dish because of the smokey flavor of the meat. Would love to make this on a nice fall night, with a glass of red wine by a fire. ($15)The last dish of this epic meal was the suckling pig ($30), slow roasted pig with crispy skin. Pretty sure my eyes and I perked up when I heard pig on the menu. They meat didn't dry it was still juicy. Anthony Bourdain would've loved to be part of this meal. Clearly I'm not Kosher.Service: Nick was awesome and personable, he shared his own experiences growing up also not liking fish, spicy food and only shellfish. Service was attentive and our water cup was constantly filled. He knew the menu and he told me what was in the sangria. Top contenders: for next time..Conejo en escabeche - stuffed rabbit ($18), Albndigs- lamb meatballs ($12) and Fideau- paella with shrimp, squid, clams alioli ($16)",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,12.6999998093,"birthday dinner,majority,experience,service,tables,pig,stars,bar space,hardwood floors,walls,Decor,Service,Nick,meat,SANGRIA,glass,glasses,temperature,summer dish,patio,back,tree,alioli,Beverages,suckling pig,sangria,menu,anchovy alioli,Food,some,lot,some,ground goat,flavor,place,lemon,apples,sugar,gin,point,calientes,Fritos,fish eater,artichoke,alachofa,taste,zesty,pasta,goat tacos,kick,texture,experiences,Beantown,menu,fish,part,meal,food,menu,tables,shellfish,Anthony Bourdain,sangria,meatballs,Gurullos,water cup,clams,contenders,squid,rabbit,paella,shrimp,Kosher.,meat,glass,flavor,meal,fire,red wine,skin,eyes,Conejo,Albndigs,Fideau","4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7","0.101099602878,0.0446186363697,0.0419860929251,0.038676649332,0.0350186340511,0.0311080105603,0.0308167859912,0.0306595638394,0.0306595638394,0.0306595638394,0.0306595638394,0.0266824979335,0.0237160418183,0.0201357454062,0.0146073671058,0.0146073671058,0.0145789012313,0.0122602637857,0.0118193523958,0.0116878272966,0.0116548538208,0.0116548538208,0.0116340182722,0.0116279814392,0.0113896736875,0.00981522258371,0.0097795240581,0.00976961571723,0.00890533905476,0.00889552850276,0.00845033396035,0.00809338781983,0.00808813050389,0.00808813050389,0.00800160225481,0.00781181082129,0.00781181082129,0.00781181082129,0.00781181082129,0.00780138932168,0.00779197411612,0.00779197411612,0.00778338871896,0.00777549901977,0.00777549901977,0.00775506999344,0.00775506999344,0.00736081926152,0.0070913862437,0.0070913862437,0.00708139827475,0.00692088482901,0.00687345396727,0.0066288090311,0.00661892164499,0.00645456509665,0.00602317415178,0.00602029357105,0.00590005423874,0.0057890326716,0.00526726199314,0.00468072295189,0.00457878177986,0.00457681389526,0.00419853115454,0.00364507501945,0.00364188756794,0.00364188756794,0.00364188756794,0.00364188756794,0.00364188756794,0.00364188756794,0.00311809778214,0.00291258702055,0.00291086919606,0.00264899828471,0.0026459437795,0.00231610308401,0.00231610308401,0.00231479760259,0.00231354846619,0.00215564179234,0.00215564179234,0.00215564179234"
La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,946,"Struggle of the evening: Suckling pig or Fideua? Torn, I ultimately chose the suckling pig, which was one of the specials. And lesson learned: specials don't typically wind up being as special as advertised. Also, I'm unfortunately a sucker for specials (One more time: specials!).While the pig was good, it was a tad dry and it wasn't an outstanding, knock-your-socks-off dish. It was OK enough to make me deeply regret not ordering the fideua so I may have to come back for it. I was thiiiiis close to throwing my hands in the air and just ordering it after I finished my pig, but we had already ordered 3 apps prior to our main courses, and I didn't feel like pigging out any more (pun always intended).Of the appetizers offered, we went with the Croqueta del Dia, which was smoked ham and cheese for that day, Sardina a la Antigua, and Migas. They were all good, although we could've done without the croquetas. They were disappointingly tiny, only came with 2, and were more cheesy than anything else. To be honest, none of the appetizers really jumped out at me so we kind of rolled the dice and went with it. The Migas was probably the best of the 3 and apparently it's not always on the menu (?) so go for it if you see it.I left feeling as though I was supposed to love the place much more than I did. Maybe I just ordered all the wrong things but dinner was good. Not great.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,74465,"As to be expected, the results of searching for Sephardic cuisine on Yelp are far from appetizing. Along with dozens of synagogues and nursing homes, a gastroenterologist pops up, as does as a religious bathhouse. Among the handful of restaurants listed, most are Israeli and/or Mizrahi, and one is La Vara.Departing from the average tapas offerings of most NYC establishments, La Vara attempts to capture the cultural melding, and often clashing, at the heart of Spanish culinary history...and it does a damn good job of it.With my host of food allergies, I expect to eat a done-up salad and simple piece of meat when stepping into foodie heaven. Our waitress welcomed me to a noisy, yet half-empty La Vara with a detailed menu, conveniently coded for those with restrictions. So instead of eating like a rabbit, I ate one. The Conejo en Escabeche reminded me of an elegantly plated Moorish tagine, yet the bitterness of cooked olives perfectly balanced the sweetness of this dish. My dining companion initially dismissed rabbit as 'flavorless' and olives as 'briny'. He devoured most of it, leaving me to the Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil which was almost as perfect. Overwhelmingly doused with cumin, the lamb paired brilliantly with the tart lemon-date preserves and acidic barbecue-style hot sauce dabbed across the plate. The condiments really hit home on the Sephardic front, the sweetness of dates and zest of lemon masked the lamb's gaminess similar to the lard/garlic treatment used by non-Muslim/Jewish Spanish chefs. The portion was generous and a tad bit overcooked, but I didn't let a bit of char get in the way of cleaning the plate. They'll offer you pieces of hard-crusted bread to sop up the sauces. Take them up on it, if you're able.I was thrilled to see traditional Migas on the menu, and forced my partner to indulge on an order... which he gobbled up in a fit of bliss.  Our waitress recommended the an egg-covered stew of fava beans and artichokes, which was more like a hot salad and lacked any distinctive flavor. As per usual, I appetizered for dessert and went with the Escalivada, also a server recommendation. By far the richest dish of the evening. If I could take a bath in a vat of that romesco sauce, I would. A bold, spicy, and nutty base for the leeks atop it. Gold. My partner went for the Churros and licked away the bowl of dulce de leche that came with them. The pitcher of sangria we ordered lasted 'til the very end, and so did our waitress, who stuck around after her shift was through to make sure we were satisfied. One of the best meals of my month... if I only could have heard myself think while eating it.",5.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",3,1,0.20000000298,11.3000001907,"waitress,most,partner,cuisine,results,one,Sephardic,Yelp,bathhouse,restaurants,nursing homes,synagogues,dozens,gastroenterologist,handful,tapas offerings,Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil,La Vara.,dining companion,Israeli,Mizrahi,NYC,salad,piece,bit,heart,establishments,foodie heaven,meat,food allergies,host,job,history,melding,Spanish,bowl,one,most,hot sauce,pitcher,menu,restrictions,rabbit,sweetness,dish,olives,rabbit,olives,sauces,lamb,plate,sweetness,dates,portion,lamb,lemon,plate,pieces,bitterness,Moorish tagine,briny,cumin,preserves,front,condiments,home,chefs,lard/garlic treatment,zest,gaminess,char,way,bread,bath,romesco sauce,stew,dish,order,Escabeche,dessert,server recommendation,vat,leeks,base,Gold,Conejo,shift,Jewish,dulce,sangria,end,meals,Escalivada,Churros,menu,salad,Migas,bliss,fit,flavor,artichokes,fava beans","1,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,2,2,1,1,7,7,3,1,1,2,1,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,7,7,4,2,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.179754257202,0.0604700855911,0.0396246053278,0.0367734842002,0.034534778446,0.0268266331404,0.0249580144882,0.0218522530049,0.0200558155775,0.0199534706771,0.0175570528954,0.0175570528954,0.0175570528954,0.0175570528954,0.0174673963338,0.0174673963338,0.0162899568677,0.0161256305873,0.0151934726164,0.0103568052873,0.0103568052873,0.0103568052873,0.00763323530555,0.00763323530555,0.00678525445983,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00667928950861,0.00648580072448,0.00587779935449,0.00563019979745,0.00559677416459,0.00558842904866,0.0052540958859,0.00513564329594,0.00513564329594,0.00512114353478,0.00510932644829,0.00510932644829,0.00510932644829,0.00509935664013,0.00509935664013,0.00509552890435,0.00508314417675,0.00508314417675,0.00507636275142,0.00507636275142,0.00484769977629,0.00464547332376,0.00464547332376,0.00463986583054,0.00463475240394,0.00447040377185,0.00447040377185,0.00446167914197,0.00444749137387,0.00444749137387,0.00444155698642,0.00444155698642,0.00444155698642,0.00406448915601,0.00406448915601,0.00406448915601,0.00406448915601,0.00405958201736,0.00405958201736,0.00405510747805,0.00401388155296,0.00379037135281,0.00355658656918,0.0034501531627,0.00338391796686,0.00302513991483,0.00302100530826,0.00302100530826,0.00301621528342,0.00301403016783,0.00301403016783,0.00301196496002,0.00264665135182,0.00248714466579,0.00240622228011,0.0020838601049,0.00208257115446,0.00208257115446,0.00208134273998,0.00204405700788,0.00178174173925,0.00151711772196,0.00151569244917,0.00137871189509,0.00132723420393,0.00132723420393,0.001325987163,0.001325987163,0.001325987163"
La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,15792,"La Vara is truly destination dining and perhaps an ideal first date restaurant. It features an exotic menu, is located on one of the prettiest streets in the city (a quiet, residential block no less), and generally hits both dimensions of food quality and (relative) value. Actually, let me walk away from that last assertion to simply state that menu prices appear low, but the sum total at the end might end up being greater than what you had expected... still, isn't that true for all meals featuring Tapas / Small Plates?Lately, there appears to be a Spanish restaurant revival in the city. What's intrigued me about La Vara are the Sephardic and Moorish influences in the cuisine - appealing to the romantic in me who likes to embellish the imagination of what life in Andalusia must have been like prior to 1492 with followers of three great religions co-existing harmoniously. So, it's somewhat annoying when servers completely ignore the cumin, saffron, and eggplant influences in the cuisine (introduced by Muslims) while crediting the entire differentiation from the norm as Sephardic.I don't believe that I've appreciated a similar sensory onslaught in a meal lately. The ubiquitous meatballs (lamb) are incredibly juicy and go well with the mint yogurt, while the crispy eggplant (Berenjina) with honey, nigella seeds and melted cheese is superlative and absolutely best-in-class. I've enjoyed the Gurullos for the fluffiness of the pasta (thought that the spiciness of the Sumac was overpowered by the butter), the Fideua for the casual introduction to noodle based paella, the Cordero (cumin roasted lamb breast with lemon-date condiment) for the interior/exterior meat texture contrast, and the Pollo Asado (half chicken roasted over spiced onions, cumin, coriander) for spices and gravy - though it would probably wow others not intimately familiar with Indian cuisine. There have been a few misses as well. Among them Ortiguillas Po'Boy (special) as one of the many fried dishes on the menu, but one where the oil dominates the flavor, the Garbanzos (spiced chick peas - one of the laggards amongst more popular recent versions such as at Pig and Khao), and Remojon (citrus and salt cod salad with pistachios) which had a mélange of flavors and textures - perhaps too many for any to stand out or for salad to serve the function of an appetizer.My favorite desserts have been the Torta Santiago (flourless almond cake) with its effortless charm and the Egipcio which is much like a Pop-Tart filled with date and walnut paste brought to magical heights courtesy the lemon curd and the tender shortbread. Top notch! But, not what it would appear on first glance - much like most of the meal. Tapas have truly grown up beyond the typical Patatas Brava. So, it no longer pinches one to shell out $ 70-80 (pp) to leave with a full stomach and with the taste buds given a complete workout.

I went back again looking forward to it, knowing that it will probably be a good experience. It wasn't. To be fair, the drinks were good and the staff nice, yet not engaging.I am writing this review for the owner/chef who I know is amazing and probably isn't there as much to pay attention for small details in the kitchen which have made the food go downhill.After ordering, we were presented with a small amuse bouche of carrot juice and cumin in a sherry glass. This alone started the meal off poorly, the opposite of the amuse point. It was flavorless and cold. We wish it just didn't come out at all. We started with the fried eggplant with honey and cheese which was one of my favorites previously. There was too much cheese, the eggplant was not crispy and not sweet enough. The chicken hearts were good but it was a very small bite more of a snack than an appetizer and not worth $13. The migas (also one we raved about in past visits) had too much paprika and not enough grapes; it was not exciting. The croquettes of the day which were described as Serrano ham were actually some bland potato/cheese fried mush.. Not distinguishable and definitely no ham involved. The last dish, Lingua special was the worst of all. Arrived after 45 min sitting and wasn't sure it was even the right cut. It tasted like regular beef and was very chewy. The carrots were undercooked as well. Also small for the price, $18 for a tiny stew.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,193760,"La Vara, serving ""cocina casera,"" is a small Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The food is delicious and authentic, with dishes from various regions in Spain. However, we will not be returning to La Vara due to the ridiculous pricing and portions.Here are the dishes that we had:Croquetas del día (jamón serano) $5     These croquetas were okay. However, they were clearly not homemade or at least frozen and reheated.Gurullos (pasta murciana) $15     This thick, handmade pasta was like gnocchi. The ground goat and butter made it a very succulent dish.Cordero al ajo cabañil $18This joke can explain our experience with the lamb:     ""¿Cómo ha encontrado usted el cordero?¨     ¨¡De milagro!¨   Waiter: ""How did you find the lamb?""   Customer: ""It was a miracle that I even found it at all!""Vino tinto: Quinta ribera del duera $9dry, complemented the meal wellBeer on tap: Radeberger Pilsner $6very refreshing____________________________________I would never write this review if this were the first Spanish restaurant that I had tried in New York. We are a mixed Spanish-American family and have tried many dishes all over Spain, as well as many other types of restaurants in New York We also enjoy cooking Spanish dishes and dishes from many places.We are fans of Karlos Arguiñano, a cook from Bilbao with a cooking TV show, whose son recommended this restaurant. We have Spanish-American friends who work for various Spanish wine and food companies. We have tried many Spanish restaurants and food stores in New York and have just lost hope. This restaurant experience was the straw that broke the camel's back. We were hoping that it would prove otherwise.In Spain, a tapa is a small plate that comes free or for between 3 and 10 euros. Ten euros implies a larger portion that can be shared. While eating and drinking, Spaniards usually order or are served for free several tapas to share and may move from bar to bar while doing so.""Cocina casera"" means homemade food and also implies traditional dishes, of the kind that you imagine your grandmother making.However, La Vara is yet another example of the many New York Spanish restaurants taking advantage of the ""tapa"" fad. ""Tapas"" in New York has come to mean something else. A ""New York tapa""  a very expensive and small plate that you cannot share with anyone, but most order many in order to eat properly.

Everything we ordered was complex and delicious and all the flavors shone through without competing.  It was all so good I can't even pick a favorite, although if you twist my arm : ) I'd have to say either the croqueta or the cochinilla (pork).  We chose this place because of its proximity to the cocktail bar we were at and it was such a pleasant surprise-honestly one of the reasons I just love New York City.  It wasn't until I got home and googled it that I found out La Vara has a Michelin star...when I told my husband, his response was ""Cool!

The dish would have been wonderful with Spanish rabbit, but didn't work with local material. My son's entree was an insult to the idea of lamb: the basic content (really? meat? lamb???) was tasteless, treated with an interesting crust of Moroccan spice. A Mallorcan flat bread and its topping were delicious. Desserts were quite good. Dishes are small and unsatisfying.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,27101,"Let's get one thing out of the way upfront: The chef here is talented and capable of creating wonderful dishes. That's the good part. The ONLY good part. There's zero love here. Everything conspires against the potential of the food. This restaurant seems to be run by people who really don't like people, and wish they would stay away. So while  the food's quality ranges from decently good to excellent, it's served in absurdly, insanely (even for NY) tiny portions. Example: A $14 salad at brunch consistent of a very small plate of chopped vegetables and maybe half an ounce of minced (canned) tuna. It would've been an adequate amount to make one bruschetta, no more. Yet the waitress steered my wife towards it claiming it was more of an entree size than the shrimp salad she initially wanted. Bread with your meal? Not unless you ask for it, and even then, it will be stale (on two occasions) and served with no butter or oil. Over three visits, we discovered that not a single thing here is entree sized. It may be called an entree, it will certainly be priced like an entree, but they are, at best, moderate appetizers. Imagine a tapas restaurant at quadruple the normal price - which in NY is already high- and you'll get the idea. So the value is abysmal. You can easily spend $50-$75 per person on food alone here and leave hungry. This isn't the upper east side, where you can get away with that kind of nonsense. We have many restaurants in this range that serve excellent food in reasonable portions: Hibino, Petit Crevette, Char 54, Frankies, Prime Meats and many more. La Varra is way below par.The service ranges from haughty and condescending to non-existant. Even when you do have one of the ladies' attention, it is dour, cold and dismissive. One evening we stood at the front and waited for 15 minutes to get the attention of the staff, despite the restaurant being half empty. We finally left, unserved. They behave as if they are some sort of gift to the neighborhood, and we should be grateful that they arrived. We're not.

It might offer the most delicate and artful presentation, but I felt relaxed, satisfied and happy during my two visits--one dinner and the other brunch.My last visit was around 1pm when most people just woke up in Brooklyn and started to form lines at coffee shops or bakeries. The little cute restaurant sits next to the Cobble Hill Park is nice and inviting. Big windows bring enough lights into the space; the decorations in white and gold are modern and simple; the tiny garden in back is a perfect spot for summer brunch.Highly recommend fired chickpeas for both dinner and brunch; cumin lamb, and duck for dinner; huevos a la flamenca for brunch! Wines are solid and priced seasonable (many options under $50).Overall, quality is consistent from my last visit. All the dishes I tried there are flavorful and delicious. Although portion is on the smaller size it's justified by the price. Plus, I could try more dishes!Note: La Vara was also the name of a Jewish newspaper published in New York until it ceased in 1948. It was written in Ladino, a Castilian-Hebrew hybrid that was to Spain what Yiddish was to Eastern Europe.

Thankfully, La Vara was just delicious as I'd hoped!My family is from Spain, so I was eager to try La Vara, which draws inspiration from Moorish cuisine (The Moors have a complex history and influenced a lot of we consider Spanish cuisine). Went with my mom and sat in the outdoor courtyard, which I definitely recommend. We ordered a bunch of tapas including the jumbo head-on prawns in a garlic lemon sauce, paella with noodles, lamb meatballs and a dish of torn bread, chorizo, egg and other tasty ingredients I can't quite recall. All of it was tasty but I think my favorite dish was the paella. It was totally different from the Spanish paella I grew up with, which is made with rice. The clams and squid were super flavorful and the sauce was light and delicious. My least favorite dish was the shrimp. Normally I love head-on shrimp but these were just overly salty. The lemon also overpowered the shrimp. In all, I'd love to return to La Vara to try more of the menu.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4735,"It's likely necessary for me to caveat this review with the fact that we visited La Vara for their weekend brunch, so I can't say for certain how representative that experience is for the restaurant as a whole. What I can note, however, is that La Vara was one of the newer additions to the list of Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC in 2016, and they've continued to hold their accolade for a second year. The restaurant specializes in Spanish dishes that are more notably influenced by Jewish and Moorish cuisine, so ingredients such as cumin, saffron, and even orange blossom are more prominently featured in the cooking.The restaurant is quaintly located in a tree-lined street in Cobble Hill; the well-windowed front and white-themed interior give the venue a bright and welcoming initial appearance, and was especially welcome on the sunny afternoon that we visited. The inside was quite busy as well, so reservations are very much recommended (and easily made via OpenTable), but the majority of guests seemed to be locals and families. It's a fairly laid-back and casual atmosphere, so there's no need to dress up or go out of your way to feel at ease here.We started off with a order of the Spiced Chickpeas, which were delightfully crispy and generously spiced with cumin, paprika, and cayenne with just the right amount of salt. They're ideal for keeping your tastebuds occupied without filling up your stomach, and can be shared with a small group. As for the mains, I went with the Lamb Cuchifrito, which was a dish comprised of braised lamb over a potato and pepper hash and topped with two poached eggs. In retrospect, the dish was better portioned as an appetizer versus an entrée, but the lamb was tender and flavorful, and the bed of potatoes and peppers were well-seasoned complemented well with the runny yolk from the eggs. As a whole though, there wasn't anything particularly noteworthy or outstanding about the dish that would entail an immediate return visit.Perhaps I'll return for a second visit during their evening hours, but until then La Vara...",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.5,6.40000009537,"restaurant,experience,fact,weekend brunch,whole,review,La Vara,dishes,lamb,accolade,restaurants,restaurant,front,dish,list,additions,cuisine,restaurant,locals,Spiced Chickpeas,inside,cumin,dish,need,majority,cumin,venue,street,blossom,interior,saffron,ingredients,guests,families,reservations,dish,atmosphere,way,order,paprika,NYC,Michelin,Moorish,Jewish,Spanish,appearance,eggs,pepper,potato,peppers,potatoes,appetizer,hash,entrée,retrospect,Cobble Hill,OpenTable,eggs,visit,anything,yolk,whole,return,amount,salt,cayenne,stomach,group,mains,bed,tastebuds,Lamb Cuchifrito","2,7,7,4,2,7,1,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,1","0.0800061523914,0.0725907981396,0.0594632588327,0.0594632588327,0.0594632588327,0.0594632588327,0.057758435607,0.03718451038,0.0250810887665,0.015538171865,0.014739304781,0.0146639607847,0.0120049100369,0.0117837954313,0.0109052183107,0.0109052183107,0.0108494171873,0.00990757998079,0.00894087739289,0.00885433796793,0.00871734973043,0.00837440043688,0.00805798918009,0.00775655498728,0.00768062565476,0.00761467032135,0.00761165563017,0.00732790166512,0.00732790166512,0.00732790166512,0.00732790166512,0.00732790166512,0.00730125233531,0.00730125233531,0.0068532298319,0.00669284770265,0.00666294200346,0.00666294200346,0.00666294200346,0.00666294200346,0.00646063219756,0.00646063219756,0.00642753439024,0.00642753439024,0.00642753439024,0.00594899011776,0.00566597143188,0.00566597143188,0.00566597143188,0.00565639371052,0.00565639371052,0.00565639371052,0.0049574826844,0.00494910124689,0.00494910124689,0.00433962186798,0.00432382710278,0.00391677254811,0.00391092943028,0.00364560354501,0.00342680956237,0.00342169660144,0.00342169660144,0.00218391697854,0.00218391697854,0.00218391697854,0.00217887340114,0.00217887340114,0.00217461795546,0.002143581165,0.00212430441752,0.0012871013023"

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,77331,"Informal restaurant in a lovely spot serving (mostly) small plates. I love the flavor palate here - Mediterranean/spanish where vegetables play star roles. Our party of three ate  dinner here and couldn't find an off note in the many dishes we shared. We agreed afterward that the greatest standouts were the fried artichokes, the cucumber and grain salad, and the duck breast. However, how can I not call out the fried eggplant in cheese sauce, the sobrasada and the pig? Suffice it to say we were stuffed but still managed to savor three desserts, which were excellent.The restaurant itself is informal and small.

I'll re-review again.Came for dinner on a Wed night around 8:30. Zero wait, score! Sidenote, I wish life was a series of small plates. For instance, you could be a zookeeper for two mos and bounce off to being a pro wrestler another month. Just, small plates. Lots of them. Anyway, WE ordered a series of small plates: Alcachofa fried artichokes, anchovy alioli: The alioli made this dish, which is saying a lot for me bc i dislike white creamy sauces. Fried artichokes were exceptionally tasty,Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil: my favorite dish of the entire menu. lamb was incredibly tender and flavorful. Brick De Acelgas: Interesting take on a veggie spring roll. Prob healthier. Would've preferred it to be not fried. And, two specials - raw scallop dish in a sauce and a pane with chorizo. The raw scallop was really interesting. It was tartare-esque with bursts of citrus. The pane w chorizo was good in concept, but we had to request a 3 min egg on top and some fresh ground pepper.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,6908,"A tapas restaurant with the pedigree of Txikito, but approaching it by way of Moorish and Jewish influences.  Tucked discreetly in a quiet, residential Cobble Hill block, La Vara is a cozy place of exposed brick contrasting with white.  Suited for small groups and quiet dinners, although there are two banquette tables by the windows for larger groups as well as some bar seats.  This low-key restaurant quickly garnered attention after opening, and seemed deserving of it at my visit.Lengthy menu divided into snacks (pica pica), fried (fritos), breads (panes), cold (frios y ensalata), hot (calientes), and desserts (postres), with full ingredient lists of each.  Be ready for the list of specials.  As your server describes each, it may sound nearly as long as the print menu.  As typical of NYC tapas, portions vary, but few are likely to approach standard entree sizes.  Most are sized for sharing among small groups of 2 - 4, and this is the best course to take.The food was lovely to lay eyes on, colors and textures arranged or mounded to create a beautiful palette in every dish.  Flavors were no disappointment, with great use of textures.  Among the refreshing, there were tender artichokes and fava beans bound by a silky poached egg and showered in bits of crisped crumbs.  A tower of fried mini shrimp cluster atop a smooth cubed cucumber and tomato salad, contrasting perfectly.  Quail eggs served with green tahini touched with olive oil make a good snack; a plus that the diner peels them, in my opinion.  Croquetas, varying each day, came in a pair, well-fried and tasty.Rich, lingering flavors can be found in a simple dish of earthy anchovies soaked in good olive oil, doused with sesame and crushed hazelnuts, great with charred toast.  The migas, a dish of chunks of chorizo, bread crumbs, grapes, onions, and capers was a wondrous riot of flavors savory, sweet, and sour, and very fragrant.Perhaps the most memorable dish was a special, the Perol de Verduras.  This layered vegetable dish highlights the best of La Vara: well-cooked, fresh ingredients, combinations that both contrast and complement in flavor and textures, with a delicious sauce.  And a sight to behold.  It deserves a permanent place on the menu.La Vara is a wonderful tapas place, and the best in Brooklyn, although arguably competition is lacking.  The food is inventive and fantastically made.  As expected with tapas, the cost will add up with multiple plates so plan accordingly, but hardly unexpected for the quality of execution.  At its tiny size and limited reservation policy, come early and with no more than a party of four.",4.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, NY",3,0,0.5,11.8000001907,"tapas restaurant,pedigree,way,influences,place,Perol de Verduras,groups,groups,Jewish,Moorish,Txikito,tapas place,block,brick,dinners,windows,banquette tables,menu.La Vara,Most,Cobble Hill,menu,restaurant,snacks,pica pica,breads,ingredient lists,bar seats,postres,desserts,calientes,opening,fritos,panes,attention,ensalata,server,dish,tapas,food,each,print menu,groups,textures,textures,entree sizes,best,flavors,course,list,crumbs,plus,olive oil,Croquetas,specials,portions,palette,colors,disappointment,use,fava beans,bits,egg,tower,few,vegetable dish,flavor,shrimp cluster,cucumber,tomato salad,opinion,diner,tahini,Quail eggs,pair,textures,snack,ingredients,complement,contrast,combinations,sauce,sight,food,tapas,NYC,best,Flavors,eyes,size,dish,competition,plates,quality,execution,reservation policy,party,artichokes,dish,dish,flavors,cost,olive oil,bread crumbs,toast,hazelnuts,sesame,earthy anchovies,grapes,chorizo,chunks,onions,capers,Brooklyn","2,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,3,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2","0.123050071299,0.0401211827993,0.0401211827993,0.0401211827993,0.0298055391759,0.0291709788144,0.0239417888224,0.0239417888224,0.0238593779504,0.0238593779504,0.0238593779504,0.0212220419198,0.0191737841815,0.0191737841815,0.0190759580582,0.0190759580582,0.0179096329957,0.0174801461399,0.0142367538065,0.0113727422431,0.00913501810282,0.00830996409059,0.00830996409059,0.00830996409059,0.00830996409059,0.00830996409059,0.00729831913486,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00727178435773,0.00705364812165,0.00698930164799,0.00659323949367,0.00647614477202,0.00616973591968,0.00613813335076,0.00611580908298,0.00611580908298,0.0061066923663,0.00601241458207,0.00599094713107,0.00598676223308,0.00581206660718,0.00559620233253,0.00554727995768,0.0054966066964,0.00506481481716,0.00489931553602,0.00489655463025,0.00487572420388,0.0048674819991,0.0048674819991,0.00486022327095,0.00486022327095,0.00485373940319,0.00485373940319,0.00485373940319,0.00484788138419,0.00457640783861,0.00456492742524,0.0044653583318,0.00443640165031,0.00443640165031,0.00443640165031,0.00443151267245,0.00443151267245,0.00443151267245,0.00443151267245,0.00442701997235,0.00414883345366,0.00393095100299,0.0037736047525,0.00330159347504,0.00330159347504,0.00330159347504,0.00330159347504,0.0032988935709,0.00319292140193,0.00308264582418,0.00288687669672,0.00286809052341,0.00284771784209,0.00282235024497,0.00260323332623,0.00248640147038,0.00228221202269,0.00227899570018,0.00227899570018,0.00227899570018,0.00227751373313,0.00227751373313,0.00210246373899,0.00208392459899,0.00208196719177,0.00196050014347,0.0017241690075,0.00165815104265,0.00165659328923,0.0014506294392,0.0014506294392,0.0014506294392,0.0014506294392,0.00144926656503,0.00144926656503,0.00144926656503,0.00144926656503,0.00144926656503,0.00135084625799"

How can I go back to plain old steamed ones at home?*Cordero al ajo Cabanil - Cumin roasted lamb breast. Hearty and flavorful.*Lechon - Not on their regular menu, but the absolute best suckling pig I've had in Brooklyn or Manhattan! We should've ordered more of this and were politely fighting over the pieces. Tasty, tender pork with absolutely fantastic crispy skin.The bartender mixes good specialty cocktails and the wine list is almost exclusively Spanish. Service is pleasant and accommodating.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,90939,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Friday night, around 6:30pm. They told us the wait would be about 15-30 minutes, it ended up to be about 35 minutes. However, the hosts and servers were extremely nice, constantly asking us if we were ok and giving us updates on our table. As for the food - everything was absolutely delicious.

I only had very few small plates and yet I was nonetheless impressed by nearly every aspect. I passed on the ""fried"" section (!) section, but, luckily my friend ordered the fried eggplant, and they were little pieces of happiness. Only lightly fried, barely coated rectangular shaped eggplant, with sweet honey, melted in a soft white cheese. After that amazing, yet tiny dish...my 'noodle' paella was arrived. It barely resembled paella but that wasn't a bad thing. Thin, short noodles were tossed with shrimp, clams and calamari, with a huge swipe of  Aioli  to dip in.The waitstaff is very communicative but not in your face. Sometimes, they sound like they are in a play, ultra-emphasizing every word especially the Spanish ones, but, I would rather understand what they are saying and they tell you the prices of specials which I appreciate.The only downfall is the seating. I would prefer to  have a little more personal space so that I can hold a private conversation with my dinner guest and not edit my conversation, feeling on display. The communal tables are made up of smaller tables that could easily be separated per party but instead are put together.The food came out rapidly-well paced and  we were given the option of whether we preferred they arrived together, or as they came out of the kitchen. The staff seemed to really want to cater to you and customize your experience. Dessert!I had the grapefruit custard, which includes a splash of booze-try it ! Due to a misunderstanding we were comped a dessert and we also got to taste the olive oil ice cream sprinkled with sea salt. Also delicious.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,589,"Love La Vara!  Great culinary creativity for tapas from Chef Alex Raij and Eder Montero. The Chelsea places are a bit more traditional (El Quinto Pinto, Txikito), but come to La Vara to be wowed.  Plus, this place is actually very vegetarian friendly!  You'll find plenty of veg dishes - perhaps even more than tapas.  Like the other places, La Vara is small  (decor is very lively and bright though) so be sure to make a rez.  I made a 2 person rez to celebrate bf's birthday for 9:15pm on a Sat.. but we arrived an hour early as we were in the area and they kindly seated us. Service was great all night- informative, helpful and prompt.  We had: - the fried chickpeas, fun as a fiery fried snack.. but not too much heat or greasiness (this was a theme across the board- even though things were fried, I never felt sick) - the crispy eggplant with cheese and honey and some kind of special black sesame seed- surprisingly light, with a hit of sweetness, very yummy- the special salad of the night- very clean summery cucumber, tomato, watercress, a special Spanish ricotta like cheese... delicious with house made croutons but I will say, had a tad bit too much dressing -the migas- house made fried pieces of bread (yum!) soaked with grapes, capers, and super cured chorizo- not the plump kind, more like the thinly dried out kind -the fideua or traditional Catalan paella made with short noodles, creamy aioli, and seafood- perfectly cooked baby octo, shrimp and clams.  I love this type of authentic paella, which is not tomato based or rice based as others are.  The noodles had a strong seafood flavor and almost tasted a little Asian-the vegetable terrine, a special. Light tomato sauce with fried cauliflower on a bed of potato and zucchini... really hearty but light at the same time -for dessert, we were debating between the sea salt and olive oil and date cake. Our server highly recommended the date cake, and it was definitely really nice.  It was like a softer biscotti on the outside- hard, but chewy and gooey on the inside with a dark molasses type of feel.  Atop was cream and a really yummy lemon curd- I love tart desserts!-of course, we had a pitcher of Sangria, which gives you about 5 glasses. It's not overtly sweet and disgusting like many other places; very fresh and tart with fresh fruit.

At this point I was ready to curse this guy out and walk out, but Molly the bartender saved the night.   We ended up grabbing seats at the bar and had an amazing experience with the food and wine.  The anchovy appetizer fantastic and the Pork entree was cooked perfectly.  Overall a good meal that would have gotten 4 stars, but the 90 minute wait and preferential treatment to this jagoff's friends made it get knocked down.   I understand it's opening week and everyone wants to have their friends or whomever join, but service is king and at the end of the day, everyone is a customer.Thank you Molly for saving our dinner experience!",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,7.19999980927,"king,restaurant industry service service,restaurant,name,way,owners,host,friends,Txikito,wait,meal,meal,wait,table,bar,king,host,drink,smell,response,appetizers,table,name,kitchen,group,friends,Molly,anchovy appetizer,customer.,service,entree,jagoff,treatment,stars,everyone,friends,WTF,dinner experience,everyone,people,Pork,experience,bar,bartender,guy,wine,food,seats","1,7,2,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,1,1,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,1,1,3,7,1,1,3,7,2,1,1,6,7,7","0.132126286626,0.117447756231,0.0848262310028,0.0514124706388,0.0485613159835,0.0450337342918,0.0440528802574,0.0385489687324,0.026747263968,0.0237791966647,0.0226077456027,0.0196255519986,0.0196255519986,0.0196255519986,0.0195543225855,0.0194112639874,0.0181921236217,0.017114430666,0.0137639921159,0.013682375662,0.0131746931002,0.0130770541728,0.0119379255921,0.0115289604291,0.0114434910938,0.00976970978081,0.00904110912234,0.00889446306974,0.0087076742202,0.00827974546701,0.00778255891055,0.00777575932443,0.00777575932443,0.00777575932443,0.00753119122237,0.00676049059257,0.00630169967189,0.00614911830053,0.00607168022543,0.00496667949483,0.00460816826671,0.00390630913898,0.00390630913898,0.00342101790011,0.00342101790011,0.00341754755937,0.00341754755937,0.00341754755937"
La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,14515,"My wife and I are huge fans of the proprietors' Manhattan basque tapas restaurant, Txikito: we have probably been over 30 times, including having our wedding reception dinner there back in 2010 because we so wanted our friends and family to sample our favorite restaurant. So since we have moved from Chelsea to Clinton Hill in 2011 we haven't gone back to Txikito so often. When I read Chef/owners Alex and Eder were opening a place in Brooklyn I was really looking forward to trying it out.I took my wife there for a recent birthday weekend dinner. We were not disappointed: different aesthetic vibe to Txikito, but the food was very similar with exquisite tastes and lots of kitchen TLC. I had both a superb cold cod salad (Remojón) and a skate special (what can I say I like fish) and my wife had the delicious daily Croquetas and Garbanzos Fritos to start. We both chose the half chicken (Pollo Asado) which with its cumin was really good. The staff were impressed we polished off two servings. Like at  Txikito the deserts are exquisite in flavor and we had the orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd, sweet cream (Egipcio) which might have been a dish to many, but it was a birthday dinner after all.Like Txikito another superb restaurant, where every dish is delicious and served with care.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,28303,"La Vara is tightly tucked into a very cute corner of Clinton Street, by the park. The location is perfect, and the space is a cute one, conducive to smaller groups overall, but it also has a few 5 and 6 tops, I believe. Service has been good so far, sometimes slow but usually just fine.The food is really wonderful. I have heard it's Jewish inspired Spanish, and that does not really show through to me, except perhaps in the chicken dish, but either way, the food is overall quite delicious. The eggplant fritters with honey, as many people have commented, are a must try. The flatbreads are all great. The chicken, well, I could make it at home, but my friend loved it. I have also had a special, this white bean soup with cod, which literally was the best soup I have ever had. It was one of those lick-the-bowl clean, except it must be done in a civilized way so I used bread, types of soups. They always seem to have many specials, which is  nice.Wine by the glass (and I'm sure by the bottle) is great, and at a good price point.The downside? I feel that it is too expensive for the portion sizes. The eggplant is a perfect example - a few small pieces of fried eggplant for like $9. Most of the portions are quite small. Oddly enough, in TONY, they were features as a ""cheap eats"" location. They are not.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,829,"(4.5 Stars)We walked out of La Vara thinking, ""That was one of the best meals we have had in recent memory."" Surprisingly, La Vara did not arrive on our radars from one of our usual sources - the countless food blogs we frequent - but simply from strolling through the delightful Cobble Hill neighborhood, dreaming about being able to afford one of the gorgeous brownstones, and then - oh so fortuitously - stumbling upon this gem one summer's eve. We took one look at the menu and booked for the following weekend.Seated on the small patio outside, we were transported to an idyllic, quiet oasis on a tiny deck in Brooklyn. (Note: It can get rather loud inside, though, once the masses arrive.) We took to the extensive menu and began deliberating. Of course, the staff were an absolute delight and - not only guided us through the treats on offer - but also suggested that we order a few plates, get through those and then reevaluate our hunger/desires from there. Unlike former greats (read: Traif, which has now become rather disappointing), we were given the freedom to make ad hoc decisions as to where we saw our palates moving through the course of the meal. And they moved, baby! As George Constanza would say. But this is not Seinfeld.Food (First Round): We started with the Alcachofa (fried artichokes, anchovy aioli) which were sublime. I would have been completely content with seven plates of this constituting our meal. You must order these.The garbanzos fritos (La Vara spiced chickpeas) were very tasty, though - considering how spectacular everything else is on the menu - this is one of those cheap thrills on which I wouldn't necessarily waste my appetite. If you need something to nibble on during your leisurely meal, grab some for the table, but this would not be on my ""Best of La Vara List"".The Berenjena con Miel (crispy eggplant with honey, melted cheese, nigella seed) was great. While it did not represent eggplant in its typical form, it was a combination of crispy-on-the-exterior-­silky-on-the-interior and bathed in a tub of honey-cheesy heavenly curds. Praise the lord!(Second Round):The salt-baked fish of the day with harrisa ajada was delicious. We ordered a single piece of the white fish and the delicateness of the fish, paired with the fragrant bite of the harrisa proved to be the perfect balance to the other rich items on our table.The Cordero Al Ajo Cabanil (cumin roasted lamb breast, scallion, preserved lemon-date condiment) was as exquisite as it sounds. Like all the dishes at La Vara, the flavor combinations are flawlessly executed, with the sweetness of the preserve cutting the richness of the perfectly prepared lamb. ""Oh my!"" as George Takei would say. This should certainly be on your eating itinerary.(Dessert):The Egipcio (orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd, sweet cream) was delicious -- it is everything you wish a fig newton could be... but thicker and richer. When balanced with the tart richness of the lemon curd and the fluffiness of the cream, there was much in the way of moaning with pleasure.Natillas de Arroz con Leche (cinnamon-rose and rich scented custard with grapefruit and rosemary) was also a delight - delicate and floral, it was a perfectly refreshing way to end an incredible meal.Conclusion:As with all tapas places, you run into the problem of finding a delicious dish and wanting to eat all of it, lamenting the fact that you ever agreed to share these delectable items. For two, the portions were perfect, providing us with a chance to slowly make our way through the lovely menu. Of course, we are already strategizing our next meal. At around $120 for two people (including a glass of wine), it is well within the realm of reason when compared to the likes of The Grocery, which is a little more dear.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,54348,"Went here last night, had a wonderful experience. A small space on Clinton, but tastefully done. Atmosphere is airy and playful, with decor that doesn't try too hard to be cool. Tight, and hard to walk around really, but overall bearable (although this was a Thursday, not sure how cramped it gets on weekends).Despite a few slip ups (hostess not paying attention, bartender forgot our glasses of wine while we waited for a table, but apologized and was pleasant), my initial impression was overall good. You could bring your wine glasses outside and enjoy the weather while you wait, and the wait was not long (for 2).The service at the table was impeccable. Small plates were brought, as usual, when they are ready. Dirty/empty plates were taken away as needed, water refilled, etc. The server was fantastic. Accommodating, understood the intricacies of the menu and the food, and was a delight to interact with. Very profession, and she knew her shit.Now, the food: We had the lamb meatballs with mint yogurt, which were very good but not great, the meat quality didn't astound me. The roasted beet salad with sunflower seeds and oil was fantastic, the beets were perfectly done. Tomato rubbed bread with cured meats was amazing, I haven't tasted something that good in a while. Eggplant with honey and cheese was the best part. It tasted like ""french toast sticks with eggplant"" as my friend described. We also had a zucchini special appetizer stuffed with cheese in a tomato sauce. Really good. For dessert we had the olive oil ice cream (better than I expected), and the date walnut tart with sweet cream and lemon preserves. That was my favorite part of the meal. To die for.So, for a bunch of small plates (not that small) and a bottle of wine and another glass later, the pricetag wasn't too bad either (about 80 a person).

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,686,"I went to La Vara for brunch (hold your groans) because they didn't have any other reservations available for a Saturday (call/reserve early and often!).The space is cute, and very nondescript (especially for a Michelin starred restaurant), but that's part of the charm. There's exposed brick, tiled ceilings and a cute bar.Anyway, since it was brunch time, had to start out with Bloody Mary's (not on the menu, but basically half the patrons were sipping on them). They were delicious (and SPICY).For food, started out with the patatas bravas. They were fried well but too heavy. Maybe skip this one if you're not ravenous.For mains, they have a lot of egg dishes and variations. Shared two of them. The Tortellita de Gambas (Andalucian shrimp and a chickpea wafer with a fried egg on top) was definitely Spanish-inspired and unique. If you don't get freaked out by crispy tiny shrimp, then this is a great dish. It was over a chickpea wafer, which added a lot of texture and was a nice detour from standard toast or crostini.Also had the Huevos con Migas Aragonesas (poached eggs with chorizo and bread crumbs). Eggs were poached well, and the salty chorizo chunks and sweet roasted grapes were a good contrast.Service was great, and I would definitely come back to try their dinner menu (which everyone tells me I should've done originally).

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,193565,"Went there with the intent of having the Sepia, since I never see it on menus in New York. I ate sepia (cuttlefish) a la plancha, almost every week while visiting my sister in Spain. Sad to say, it was not available. Had to settle on other edibles.The restaurant itself is a no-nonsense, plain, white, hard chair, small table kind of place. Waiters are friendly and attentive. Not a cuddly kind of place, not even ethnic, yet, there were menu items that piqued my interest since I had not seen them here in NY. Other Spanish restaurants seem to stick to the Paella/Lobster regime, while this one dug a bit deeper.The ""amuse"" was not even amusing, since it came to my partner and I on two Chinese spoons, one tiny fried olive in each. We didn't want to offend anyone, but it was such a tiny amount of anything, it was hard not to laugh, and flavor certainly not enough to describe. I know these portions are supposed to be tiny, but this was ridiculous! I am surprised the server wasn't hysterical bring them to us.Next we had their croqueta del dîa. It was supposed to taste like Serrano Ham, but strangely, the only taste that came through was a shadow of truffle, and something cheesy. I do not recommend these particular croquettes, they may have others which may be more pronounced, but these were not. They were also small, and at $5, they were not worth $2.50 each. We ordered the fried artichoke, with a alioli/anchovy sauce. The artichoke was very good, the sauce... eh? Didn't taste the anchovies... they were cleverly hidden ($9). In Spain, the artichokes are fried in olive oil, tinged with salt and garlic. Did not taste either flavor. We than went on to the Salt baked fish of the day with harissa ajada. For $31!! two fillets, that were perfectly cooked, and their harissa ajada was very intense, had a ton of flavor, with cumin, turmeric, other middle eastern spices, but caraway was the surprise. The harissa gave the sauce it's umpth. Loved it. Next course was the lamb meatballs in a yogurt with mint surround. This was pleasant, though must say, the meatballs were not tender, in fact, they were on the hard side, though tasty with the mint.. Not sure how much they were, but there were 6 small meatballs, and just enough yogurt to eat them with. Dessert!!! The best part of the meal, and the servings were decent. If you eat there, you must have the olive oil ice cream. It is a dream. What a mouth feel! creamy, rich, olive-y, outstanding. In each bit, you could really taste the olive oil, and it was dusted with salt, which made it oh so much more interesting. We had the almond cake, too, with what tasted like a dried cranberry coulis. This was also great, if you love almond. They were both $8 each. I would say in all, it was an extremely interesting menu, whether I agreed with it or not. If you go to La Vara (the road), have the ice cream! It's a must for your taste buds! Also a well layered wallet with lots of green paper.By the way, they have a nice outside garden area, but it was too damned hot and sticky to sit outside. Luckily, people came in with kids, and they all seemed to sit outside. It was loud enough at 6:00 pm on a weekday for screaming children, too.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",4,0,0.0,22.5,"menus,shadow,amount,intent,New York,croquettes,Sepia,table kind,restaurant,sister,artichoke,olive oil,sepia,place,kind,place,menu,interest,cuttlefish,plancha,chair,flavor,menu items,Waiters,harissa,must,fillets,dream,Spain,restaurants,amuse,partner,bit,olive,regime,spoons,one,anyone,anything,people,server,flavor,alioli/anchovy sauce,sauce,salt,olive oil,artichokes,portions,lamb meatballs,lots,sauce,anchovies,caraway,course,harissa ajada,harissa ajada,yogurt,something,truffle,garlic,surprise,fish,turmeric,cumin,ton,spices,mint surround,Spanish,Lobster,Paella,Chinese,salt,almond,bit,all,Salt,olive-y,almond cake,cranberry coulis,Next,Serrano Ham,ice cream,weekday,road,taste buds,wallet,garden area,way,kids,children,others,mint,yogurt,servings,olive oil ice cream,fact,side,Dessert,meal,mouth feel,La Vara,paper.By,meatballs,meatballs,part","7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,7,6,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,5,2,7,4,2,7,7,2,7,1,1,1,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,7","0.0488664992154,0.0483137592673,0.0455170273781,0.0444849394262,0.0303398352116,0.0287093743682,0.0264283567667,0.0260852500796,0.0257581993937,0.0242292657495,0.0236975587904,0.0215885583311,0.0212322287261,0.0210471600294,0.0209396462888,0.0209396462888,0.0207064021379,0.0203671250492,0.0185846090317,0.0185846090317,0.0184225253761,0.0183490794152,0.0178269594908,0.0172455869615,0.0158633589745,0.0131263099611,0.012961294502,0.010893904604,0.00934726465493,0.00840505771339,0.00834754575044,0.00798982381821,0.00798982381821,0.00699096918106,0.00699096918106,0.00699096918106,0.00699096918106,0.00697915209457,0.00697915209457,0.0064843245782,0.00641267094761,0.0059208474122,0.00587900634855,0.00587386824191,0.00586455920711,0.00586455920711,0.00586455920711,0.00583595363423,0.00569592276588,0.00536351604387,0.00535234808922,0.00533827021718,0.00508949765936,0.00508048990741,0.00487441336736,0.00487124547362,0.00486262328923,0.00469279848039,0.00469279848039,0.00466697476804,0.00454077869654,0.00426467042416,0.00426189834252,0.00426189834252,0.00426189834252,0.00426189834252,0.00425435369834,0.00413938891143,0.00413938891143,0.00413938891143,0.00413938891143,0.0039774668403,0.00375497387722,0.00361761054955,0.00361221213825,0.00317271240056,0.00316624715924,0.0031637379434,0.0031637379434,0.00278141908348,0.00277805933729,0.00249986257404,0.00249661039561,0.00218701106496,0.00218627159484,0.00218555144966,0.00218555144966,0.00218555144966,0.0021848496981,0.00218416564167,0.00196940265596,0.00159221119247,0.00159138685558,0.00158983410802,0.00158910092432,0.00139291526284,0.00139291526284,0.001391501748,0.00139083573595,0.00138897809666,0.00129438459408,0.00129352044314,0.00083674833877,0.000757467758376,0.000688220548909"

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,59663,"Expensive as all get out. As in, impossible to get full without mortgaging your house unless you do what we did and just fill up on bread. I'm pretty sure we tore through at least 4 plates of bread and it's not even like the bread is anything special. It's just a vehicle for sopping up all the delicious sauces/juices from the various dishes. I mean, don't get me wrong, the food is pretty great, albeit nothing mindblowing. I just don't think you can justify it given the tiny portion sizes and high cost. Believe me, I have no qualms about dropping large amounts of cash if it's justified (which in some cases it is), but I can't find it in myself to do it at La Vara. We ended up getting the eggplant w/ honey and cheese which was pretty stellar and followed that up with the lamb meatballs and mint yogurt. Again, another great dish and both had me licking the plate clean. It didn't help that the servers kept trying to clear dishes off before we had finished and yes, we had 3 or 4 different waiters attending us. It probably had something to do with us arriving shortly after opening for dinner so the place was pretty empty. We also got the stuffed rabbit loin (pretty decent) and the suckling pig which was fantastic (nice and tender inside with crispy crackling skin) but quite pricey at $30. The pacing was also pretty off as well as we often felt rushed to finish a dish so that the following dish wouldn't get cold (which ended up happening with our lamb). I can't really fault the food.

Lots of stuff I had never had: sea anemone (sorry Nemo, your house is delicious and tastes like oysters) andsea cucumber (bit firm of texture but delicious). The only dish that missed was a special salt cod relleno (stuffed pepper); not because it wasn't delicious, just because it wasn't as great as all of the others. The winners were the regular menu lamb breast and eggplant & honey, the special suckling pig, a special squash and black-eyed pea dish, and the sea cucumber.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,3681,"I had dinner here with my parents and my boyfriend when my parents were visiting NYC. It's not cheap, so it's a great place to go when your parents are treating you! :) I made us a reservation about a week in advance, which I would recommend since the place is small. There are two booths by the windows in the front-perfect for larger groups. There is also seating at the bar, and then one table that seats probably 10 people, and then a small number of 2 person tables behind that. We sat at the 10 person table (be prepared to sit close to other parties!) The hostess and our waiter were both very welcoming and patient. The food came out at a good pace and our waiter even offered to chill our bottle of wine to my dad's liking. The space felt clean and simple in the best way. The exposed brick, the lighting, the minimalist decor, and the white furniture were all perfect. Now for the food! We had: -spiced fried chickpeas -- We loved these!! They had a lot of flavor--cumin, I think? They were so simple but super flavorful and addicting.-cucumber and grain salad -- Also really yummy! Again, super simple but flavorful and refreshing. A nice contrast to the salty and fried dishes. -noodle paella -- Not my favorite. Didn't have much flavor. -Catalan sausage -- This was good except that I was expecting one large sausage. This was a skinny sausage wound around a few times. -Spanish red shrimp -- Really good! Each plate comes with 2 large shrimp-lots of flavor. Expensive though. -duck special -- Delicious! This was done perfectly. I only wish we'd ordered the suckling pig! We meant to but forgot by the end of the meal. For dessert we had tres leches flavored custard. This is was okay but I would probably get the ice cream or almond cake next time. Tapas style places are nice because they draw out the meal and allow people to just sit, relax, and talk. No one is in a rush or busy scarfing down their meal because each plate comes out as it's ready, and everyone just eats a little of each one. We had a really wonderful dinner here! My only complaint is that it does get loud, so don't go with anyone who is hard of hearing!",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,19.5,"place,parents,parents,dinner,reservation,boyfriend,waiter,NYC,parents,table,advance,sausage wound,chickpeas,complaint,plate,places,person tables,person table,people,groups,windows,bar,number,anyone,booths,sausage,food,flavor,food,flavor,sausage,parties,patient,wine,pace,bottle,liking,dad,space,way,furniture,decor,lighting,lot,cumin,addicting.-cucumber,grain salad,dishes,contrast,favorite,paella,ice cream,meal,No one,meal,people,custard,dessert,almond cake,one,meal,Catalan,dinner,little,rush,everyone,plate,hostess,brick,flavor,times,red shrimp,shrimp-lots,special,suckling pig,end,Spanish","7,1,1,7,7,1,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,1,3,7,2,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,1,6,7,6,7,1,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,4,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.24053427577,0.078561834991,0.0540807805955,0.0492541827261,0.045785728842,0.0431646369398,0.0347702950239,0.0334367752075,0.0258942060173,0.0248992070556,0.0205275435001,0.0167174786329,0.0137771433219,0.0111109316349,0.0110555067658,0.0105784116313,0.00980345997959,0.00978087075055,0.00891810469329,0.00782610476017,0.00782610476017,0.00780402682722,0.00780402682722,0.00760103110224,0.00734602939337,0.00684867147356,0.00662560295314,0.00654174247757,0.00596304796636,0.00596208544448,0.0059580039233,0.0052577862516,0.00524752773345,0.00523865735158,0.00523865735158,0.00523865735158,0.00523865735158,0.00523865735158,0.00523084588349,0.00523084588349,0.0052238679491,0.0052238679491,0.0052238679491,0.00520653231069,0.00520653231069,0.00520164566115,0.00520164566115,0.00475211022422,0.00475211022422,0.00474846130237,0.00474846130237,0.00454050069675,0.00443210452795,0.00431243004277,0.00415442325175,0.00402588909492,0.00352541613393,0.00352541613393,0.0035238484852,0.0030634435825,0.0030634435825,0.00280745583586,0.00278516625986,0.00243767118081,0.00243767118081,0.00243767118081,0.00237316684797,0.00227311323397,0.00226285564713,0.00194918678608,0.001774932025,0.0017738341121,0.00155092182104,0.0015492112143,0.00154763925821,0.00154689862393,0.000918446108699"

And it did not disappoint!The restaurant is located on a quiet, tree lined street in Cobble Hill BK. I already felt welcome the moment I stepped inside. This is my fav neighborhood in BK in terms of food - you got Battersby, Dover, Bergen Hill and many others around court street and smith! And unlike popular restaurants in Manhattan, the acclaimed restaurants in this hood are less hustle bustle, more tranquil and neighborly charm. Once I seated at the bar, the friendly bar tender promptly passed me the wine and food menu. Too bad I forgot to ask her name :/ she's so lovely and gave good recommendations for food - can't ask for better services! Onto the food. I am especially liking that there are quite a few daily specials to choose from , in addition to the many options on the stable menu. I opted for the house salted cod salad and the beef tongue stew that was special of the day. Both are excellent!The cod salad was light yet pack of flavors! I adore the nutty smokey flavors from the pistachio oil drizzle over the salad - it goes hand in hand with the fresh citrus and sweet pomegranate that accompany the cod, it's magical! I can't describe it but I can def taste and enjoy it immensely :)Now the beef tongue. It brings me back all the good memories of Barcelona! The soft beef tongue are chopped in small chunks, dotted in a hearty caper tomato sauce decorated with carrots and sweet pea. It reminds me of the beef stew in Dublin which is considered peasant food but it delivers such a heart-warming effect especially in a chill autumn night. I paired it with a Spanish Grenache and they work quite well together.The only regret I had was that I went by myself and I could only tried two dishes while every item on the menu looked amazing!

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,49229,"Take note, Buttermilk Channel, Frankie's, Talde, and the rest of you overhyped restaurants - this place is the real deal, and you should all be taking notes.My husband has been wanting to try this place because he is a Spanish Jew. We walked in for dinner this evening, and were greeted by the nicest people. We were seated immediately, which was fabulous. This place is not overdone. It's actually quite lovely. Our waitress was just awesome. She was friendly, knowledgable, and ever present, without being overbearing. She even asked us from the beginning if there was anything at all that we couldn't eat. That was really cool as my husband has recently been diagnosed with a disorder that prevents him from having anything with seeds.To start, my husband had the quail egg appetizer, and I had the fried eggplant. Wow! I didn't have any quail egg, but my husband seemed to really like it. The eggplant was amazing. It was very lightly fried eggplant sticks, over honey and a soft cheese. I've never had anything like it. Even after I finished the eggplant, I dipped the bread in the cheese just to finish it. We shared a glass of sangria. It was wonderful. Authentic, and not at all saccharine. For our main course, my husband had the noodle paella, and I had the half chicken. My husband loved his paella, only he wished it had been a bit bigger. The chicken was delicious. Cooked perfectly, tender, and the skin was just amazing. It was sitting in a juice/broth, with caramelized onions. It was savory, and flavorful. I was surprised it didn't have anything on the side, but I'm not going to complain. It was a big dish. I had to take some of it home. Once we finished, our waitress kindly wrapped my chicken up in the cutest aluminum package that she fashioned herself (sometimes, it's the little oohs, and ahhs that can be exciting). We didn't think we were going to have dessert, but we decided to look at the menu. Our waitress told us of a special dessert they were serving- a french toast-type dessert with a syrup that I cannot remember. We decided on that. Holy g-d!!!!! It was like a little french toast custard of sexiness. I honestly didn't think it was going to be so good. One of the few times we actually savored dessert. We didn't want it to end. My only real gripe is that they allow very young children after sundown. As the mother of an 8 year old, sometimes I want to go somewhere nice without kids. And when i'm paying good money, I don't feel like hearing screaming toddlers, throwing utensils on the floor. It's completely disrespectful, and we all know that Cobble Hill, and Park Slope parents cannot be trusted to mind their own little heathens. The restaurant should put in a policy about this.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,73324,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. I made the reservations and we had a few changes, but they were very accommodating. Between the 4 of us, we ordered 12 plates to share. Our waitress was incredibly cool and approved our choices; she even adjusted some of the serving sizes to fit what she thought would be sufficient for our group. We started off with a pitcher of red sangria... pretty standard and tasty. It was enough for 5 full glasses.Here's the line up of what we ordered on the menu... plus a few specials they had that night:Alcachofas (fried artichokes) - I enjoyed these, but it was probably our least favorite dishBerenjena con miel (crispy eggplant) - SO GOOD. Everyone throughly enjoyed it.Huevos Rellenos (deviled eggs) - If you love deviled eggs, you will love theirs! If you don't care for DE's then you'll likely find these to be meh?Pincho de Cueta (chicken hearts w/ fresh herb salad) - the combination of the chicken heart and salad was good, but on their own the hearts were.... different/interesting. My group couldn't decide whether or not they liked it, but I thought it was a good dish for the more adventurous eater.Cordero al ajo Cabañil (roasted lamb breast) - This was really awesome... it was more like pulled lamb meat put together into a log and seared a second time. Def get this dish!Albóndigas (lamb meatballs) - these were yummy and a perfect dish to share... not mind blowing, but the meatballs were cooked perfectly and flavor was good with great sauceFideuà (paella) - VERY small portion, BUT very good... they use short thin pasta noodles in lieu of rice, plus a white sauce that oddly made the dish reminiscent of chicken and rice... except in seafood form if that makes any sense. Came with clams, octopus, and shrimp.Butifarra con Mongetes (Catalan sausage) - meh... the sausage was decent on it's own, but we agreed that the greens it came with took away from it's flavorCochinillo (suckling pig) - WINNER WINNER PORK DINNER! You have to get this dish. SO delicious. Our table's favorite of the night.... and I saw a bunch of suckling pig orders coming out of the kitchen. Nice portion size too.The specials... I can't remember any of the names, but will describe:Poached egg over asparagus and mushrooms - unfortunately the poached egg was overcooked and was a disservice to the dish. The yolk was over medium and the rest was forgettable.Duck breast - very thinly sliced duck breast with what kind of tasted like a chimichurri sauce... cooked perfectly, but forgettable and disappointing as wellSalted Doran (I think that's the name? It was fish) - this was great and very enjoyableI feel conflicted, because most of the dishes were well done and better than average... but it was so expensive and I don't feel that it was worth the price. Our bill came out to about $243 for 4 people, but I think we could've gotten our monies worth elsewhere with the same caliber. So while it was a good experience overall, it is too pricey to justify a return visit.",4.0 star rating,"Long Island, NY",4,0,0.20000000298,14.6000003815,"waitress,birthday,friend,dish,eggs,Pincho de Cueta,sauceFideuà,sauce,Butifarra con Mongetes,sizes,group,some,reservations,choices,fish,changes,plates,red sangria,pitcher,artichokes,meatballs,experience,name,dish,Everyone,line,specials,dish,dish,menu,eggplant,Huevos Rellenos,dishBerenjena,hearts,lamb meatballs,flavor,lamb meat,chicken heart,chicken hearts,lamb breast,sausage,eggs,chicken,DE's,salad,dish,group,rice,rice,log,Albóndigas,egg,lieu,seafood form,pasta noodles,clams,octopus,Alcachofas,Def,chimichurri sauce,duck breast,yolk,dishes,flavorCochinillo,disservice,sense,mushrooms,asparagus,kind,rest,medium,dish,Cordero al ajo Cabañil,egg,Catalan,bill,average,price,people,monies,elsewhere,caliber,return visit,Duck,wellSalted Doran,enjoyableI,WINNER,specials,portion size,names,greens,PORK DINNER,favorite,table,bunch,suckling pig orders,kitchen,most,any","1,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,3,7,2,5,7,7,1,7,2,7,4,1,1,1,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7","0.142661929131,0.0630331039429,0.0401330180466,0.0397322773933,0.0301974266768,0.0289949309081,0.0277841854841,0.0257542226464,0.0222904179245,0.0216866973788,0.0216866973788,0.0212685260922,0.0211342647672,0.0204778648913,0.0201671924442,0.0191502049565,0.0190523639321,0.0189298056066,0.0189298056066,0.0181391052902,0.0143253756687,0.0139536522329,0.0131683917716,0.0102268839255,0.0101425610483,0.00840446632355,0.00825071148574,0.00793885346502,0.00725723756477,0.0072193806991,0.0072193806991,0.00720529677346,0.0070169987157,0.00673684710637,0.00670972140506,0.0065940907225,0.00656591774896,0.00610248977318,0.00610248977318,0.00609338888898,0.00602830573916,0.00577549170703,0.00555587094277,0.00555064436048,0.00555064436048,0.00539481174201,0.00526841031387,0.00505339819938,0.00505339819938,0.00484272418544,0.00483687780797,0.00448548281565,0.0044213202782,0.0044213202782,0.0044213202782,0.00441683642566,0.00441683642566,0.00427486700937,0.00418870896101,0.00412682071328,0.00412682071328,0.00392168667167,0.00373035855591,0.00372833572328,0.00350119383074,0.00343112135306,0.00328612374142,0.00328612374142,0.00328387180343,0.00328387180343,0.00328387180343,0.00305922399275,0.00287075038068,0.0027012063656,0.0026146848686,0.00251148059033,0.00227191974409,0.00227051437832,0.00226917513646,0.00226917513646,0.00226917513646,0.00226917513646,0.00226789643057,0.00222185114399,0.00194378360175,0.00194251944777,0.00165400386322,0.00164838531055,0.00164838531055,0.00164719065651,0.00162196555175,0.00160152208991,0.00144317327067,0.00144317327067,0.00144317327067,0.00144317327067,0.00144317327067,0.000983585603535,0.000840919790789"

They brought out a complimentary tasting of a carrot which was soft sweet and unlike anything I had?! I found myself asking what this was and what I was enjoying!? I wasn't crazy about the blue fish special which you can get one or two fillets (we split one). I don't think I enjoyed the sauce or the fish, buuuut my friend did enjoy it, so you be the judge.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,82749,"I came here on a Friday night around 10pm and even though the place was small, we didn't have to wait too long to get a seat at the bar. However, I can imagine a reservation being necessary during peak hours. They serve small portioned plates, so I would advise getting multiple things - which takes its toll on your bank account if you are also buying drinks - which you definitely should, but so worth it!I was there with one other person so we ordered four things and shared them all:Alcachofas (fried artichokes with anchovy aoili) $9 : So delicious, the artichokes were fried perfectly and not burnt and the aoili complemented them without being overpowering. We were tempted to order a second round, but this was the first dish to come out so we decided to wait and see if we would still be hungy. Berenjena con miel  (Crispy eggplant with honey, melted cheese, and nigella seeds) $9: Also very tasty, the eggplant was exactly as described - crispy, but not overbreaded nor did it feel oily. The honey was a nice sweet bite and the cheese gave the dish a slight tanginess (the leftover cheese was great on top of the bread they serve) I just wish it was a little  more melted. Huevos Rellenos (devlied eggs, green tahini) $5: Not my favorite part of the night, I wasn't the biggest fan of the green tahini sauce on top and it was just a deviled egg which I don't find to be something very specialFideua (Valencian style noodle paella, shrimp, squid, clams, aoili) $18: One of the best dishes we had that night. Since we were sitting at the bar right next to all the waitresses, one of them told us to mix everything together rather than how it was served. I've never had paella with aoili before, but it was so good, I wish the serving was larger. But let's be honest what doesn't aoili taste good with?The drinks were also well made and the staff was very friendly and had good tips for us throughout the meal and also what their favorite dishes are so we can try it when we come back. Overall a very good experience that I would bring a small group to where you can share food and drinks and chat!",4.0 star rating,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.5,7.0,"round,seat,place,bar,things,things,honey,plates,bank account,drinks,eggplant,reservation,tanginess,Huevos Rellenos,paella,experience,anchovy aoili,drinks,toll,everything,artichokes,person,leftover cheese,aoili,egg,cheese,cheese,artichokes,eggplant,honey,top,green tahini,top,nigella seeds,fan,Alcachofas,aoili,bread,eggs,tahini sauce,serving,specialFideua,dishes,Berenjena con miel,drinks,staff,food,meal,tips,chat,dishes,group,One,one,something,bar,clams,squid,shrimp,waitresses,aoili,Valencian","7,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,2","0.108378745615,0.0825801566243,0.076623596251,0.0733848437667,0.0465666502714,0.0390494428575,0.0384001024067,0.0321860983968,0.0297681987286,0.0294032599777,0.0272633321583,0.0271154362708,0.022074431181,0.0192420501262,0.0185274686664,0.016263699159,0.0158339627087,0.0148259876296,0.0136343268678,0.0136040840298,0.013385119848,0.0117133175954,0.0107647133991,0.0106960916892,0.0100570516661,0.00987445469946,0.00985168386251,0.00904035009444,0.00898205116391,0.00898205116391,0.00820099841803,0.00818500015885,0.00818500015885,0.00785928405821,0.00763006368652,0.00739188678563,0.00721382861957,0.00717571657151,0.00716171553358,0.00716171553358,0.00636953208596,0.00528965657577,0.00468220282346,0.00465374533087,0.00462926086038,0.00440447404981,0.00423498637974,0.00368815148249,0.00368815148249,0.00368369719945,0.00317482394166,0.00316375028342,0.00294963479973,0.00294464430772,0.00287496950477,0.00267816986889,0.00234697922133,0.00234697922133,0.00234697922133,0.00234300782904,0.00187916588038,0.00138906936627"

Everyone working in that restaurant was attentive, friendly, and warm, but not to the point where we felt suffocated. Also, the decor is great.The food was pretty good too. We tried a bunch of stuff. - Fried artichokes were a (predictable) greasebomb, but the accompanying aioli was delicious. - Salt cod salad had a nice texture thing going on, but the flavors were too restrained for my liking. - Corn soup (on special) was aggressively sweet and could've used some smoke, spice, or acid to cut through it. - Chicken hearts were awesome, but too few on the plate. (6 chicken hearts and a pile of herbs for ~$15? Really guys??) - Albondigas were a standout. Aggressive lamb flavor, excellent yogurt sauce. Better savor it though, as you get 5 marble sized meatballs.- Sausage stuffed cuttlefish, which was probably our favorite dish of the night, is the only one that I would say is a can't miss dish. - Fideua was just okay, a little oversalted. - A fig dessert on special was tasty, but it was really just yogurt and figs, which are in season now.We also had a couple of glasses of sherry each and a tasty, if unremarkable, bottle of Albariño. I left feeling underwhelmed, particularly after taking the hefty pricetag into account.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,193931,"I'm not one to jump on the ""new restaurant"" bandwagon, but when I took a look at La Vara's menu, I couldn't help but get excited. In print, each dish looked vibrant and exotic and refreshingly different from the classic farm-to-table, Southern American inspired restaurants here in Brooklyn.Boyfriend and I ordered 7 dishes in total, including dessert, so I'd say we gave the menu a fair chance. The dishes arrived in rapid succession--so rapidly in fact that we were done with all 7 dishes in under 30 minutes. Tiny plate after tiny plate hit the table and each one was only OK and nothing more. The huevos de codorniz were difficult to eat and not worth the payoff after all. The aceitunas hit the table strangely late in the procession of dishes, and were disappointing at best (there was no citrus, no herb, just a lot of oil).The berenjena con miel had a lot going for it texturally (crispy eggplant, soft cheese) but it lacked salt and the honey was nonexistent. Dish after dish fell flat, notably the fideúa, which my boyfriend (formerly a resident of Spain) was extremely excited to have. The flavor of the noodles was muddled--kind of like what happens when you're trying make a meal from what's left in your pantry and you end up with something that tastes sort of generally savory (hello soy sauce), but has no distinctive flavor.The one redemptive dish was a special that night, a cuttlefish stuffed with sobrasada. Finally! A little spice! A little contrast between the tender sweetness of the cuttlefish and the oily crumble of sausage!It should be noted that the dishes are sorrowfully small, so much so that my boyfriend suggested that we take photos of each dish with a penny on the plate for scale. I don't mind small servings, but I was tremendously unsatisfied--and not just because I was still hungry. I couldn't reconcile my menu-induced expectations and my 30-minute-meal experience.As we walked out of the restaurant, less than an hour after we walked in, my boyfriend said, ""Let's go get a loaf of bread.""

It was a nice selection for a group with its focus on small plates and encouragement to share. Many great dishes stood out although surprisingly the ones I was the most excited about (blue cheese flatbread, skate special) were somewhat disappointing and ones I ordered just to fill out a full meal (pasta with goat butter, swiss chard) turned out to be amazing. I was a little baffled by what they decided to fry (like the skate) and disappointed that I wasn't given more warning about when these preparations would come up. Why anyone would take a delicious, delicate fish like skate, deep fry it is beyond me. The space was really cute, but it got really loud in there which made it difficult to talk among out party of 6. I'd say I'd come back for a date, but when wouldn't be able to share as many options. All in all, I'm glad I tried La Vara but left a little let down.

So the night started with my boyfriend, my parents, and I arriving for our 9:30 reservation 10 minutes early to be told that the party before us had just ordered another entree so it'd be a bit of a wait. That's fine, we understood that those sort of things happen and the staff has no control over it. To bide our time, we decided to have a couple drinks at the bar. Here it was that the service started plummeting downhill. First of all, it took the bartender about 15 minutes to acknowledge us. When we were able to order, my mother and I got a bottle of sparkling rose, from which the bartender poured over half a glass, noticed the glass was dirty, dumped out what she poured, and didn't even do anything to make up for what she wasted of our bottle. So basically, we lost half a glass that could have easily been made up for with the open bottle I noticed behind the bar. We both kept waiting for her to correct her mistake but nothing happened. Then 10:15 rolls around and we're still waiting for our table. We are asked again what time we made our reservation for because apparently the staff couldn't be bothered to keep tabs on the people they've left hanging. After realizing we'd been there for close to an hour, they sent us out some tiny snacks. It was a nice gesture and all but a little disappointing, after all we were famished at this point and a bowl of fried chickpeas between 4 people was not doing the trick. Finally, we were seated at a little past 10:45. The rest of the meal was okay but had been thoroughly tainted by the 1.5 hour wait. Food was decent but the plates were so tiny. Even smaller than tapas. Plus it seemed like we were being rushed.

It was that good. And I really enjoyed the empanada-style cornmeal pockets with seafood. I was hoping to try the cuttlefish dish, but they were out by the time we arrived (well past 10pm).  The husband liked but didn't love their homemade pasta with goat. I couldn't try the pasta, but the tiny nibble of goat was good if a bit bland. We both really enjoyed dessert. His ""slice"" of date cake w/ lemon curd and cream was huge, and I found my rice pudding-ish/grapefruit dish a little strange but refreshing and delicious.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,58314,"So I had a craving for paella and was on the search for an authentic quality meal in Brooklyn.  I found this restaurant. Based on the reviews I thought it would be a good choice. The menu looked eccentric. Saw pictures of the restaurant and thought what do we have to lose. Now I'm a quality over quantity girl any day of the week but the portions here with the exception of the pollo asado are really small. You've been warned.The food wasn't that great.My friend and I ordered the Alcachfa( artichokes with anchovy aiolli, Carabineros(red shrimp), pollo asado, and fideua(paella). The Alcachfa was interesting in a good way crispy and salty.The Carabineros were a joke. Two shrimp marinated in sauce for $20. After tearing off the head and breaking down the shell the shrimp were very small My friends piece was especially small. The pollo asado was tasty and juicy and the paella left more to be desired. The four shrimp in the paella looked dehydrated. The four small clams were good and the three pieces of squid were fresh and cooked well. Sigh! in retrospect I should have complained about the portions....but I felt like a fool for suggesting this place. The sangria tasted watered down and the fruits were not good. I had a slight buzz though. My friend and I ate in silence paid and left. I would not come back here. I can tell the food is cooked with quality ingredients but the portions and entrees are not equal to the prices.

So here I am. I can't remember the last time I had such an enjoyable experience at a NYC restaurant. The food was good. Like, REALLY, good. But we ate so many different things, I can't even begin to remember, much less review it all. Except for the Almond Cake. Save room for dessert. And don't plan on sharing. But what really sets La Vara apart is the service. Every single person we encountered - from the hostess, to the bartender, to the server, to the food runners - was so welcoming and so kind. From when I walked in to when we all left, I felt more like I was visiting a friend (who can really cook!) rather than sitting in a restaurant.I should mention that we were a group of women, old friends (some of us have been friends for 20+ years), that do our best to get together every other month. We all come from the restaurant business, but we're not all still in it. There seems to be something about a group of women dining out that make most servers cringe. We saw it when we worked in the business and we experience it when we dine out. And sure, after a few rounds of drinks we might get a little loud. But there's no dressing on the side, light butter, split the check 7 ways, with this group. We are out to enjoy each others company, some good food and some good wine.

I was surprised at how empty the place was, and had my pick of the tables, while the generic-looking cafe next door was overflowing with people. Huh? The menu is interesting in that there is a wide variety of sizes of dishes. Too often, brunch is giant and if you want a smaller, lighter meal, you're stuck with yogurt. I had the poached eggs with artichokes & lima beans, which were really lovely and a perfect light start to the day. Everyone else's meals were also very tasty & on the smaller side, so if you're super hungry, be aware. The bloody marys were excellent. I would have liked a second, but I guess I didn't ask for it in a Spanish accent. My bad. We also got a pastry that came with quince jam and finished with the churros.

All the food is tasty. The crispy eggplant is orgasmic, the rabbit loin tasty in its simplicity, the pasta comforting.The space is nicely designed. white tables and chairs, brick wall, vaguely spanish cut out sheet metal design on the wall. My critique: Service was too stiff. There wasn't a warm feeling and the waiter served all food too quickly. He also forgot that our pasta hadn't arrived and had already cleared away our utensils. It was not a welcoming atmosphere; as though the restaurant takes itself too seriously. The tab, including two glasses of wine was $100 before tip. The warm course, the rabbit and pasta dishes, are meant for sharing, and not entree size. So this is a lot of money for grazing food. I really want to like this place, but it needs to be more for the neighborhood.

The Quail eggs presentation is really nice and they were good, just not super interesting. Now for the mouth watering stuff: Asparagus with manchego cheese was fantastic; lamb meatballs were moist and flavorful; the Remolacha was simple yet delicious. The two stand ot dishes for me, however, were the Suckling Pig and a vegetable terrine that was a daily special that night. The vegetable terrine was so flavorful it blew my mind, and the suckling pig was unbelievably tender but the skin was crispy like a cracklin' -wow.  Finally, I had Olive Oil icecream for dessert and it was a revelation.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,14668,"More and more I'm becoming convinced that the small plates concept is just another phrase for throwing a bunch of bar food at the wall and seeing what sticks.  I'm not saying the food I had a La Vara was bad.  It's not.  Things like the olive oil flatbread topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese would be an amazing snack, teetering on top of a Madrid bar stool drinking Spanish beer.  But as part of a dinner that cost $100 in Brooklyn?  Nah.  So too the $14(!) salad of 5 overcooked shrimps, melon balls and avocado.  A fantastic, refreshing nibble if it costs 2 euros with drinks.  Not so attractive as an appetizer.  The ubiquitous beet and greens salad was too restrained here, though the flavor of the beets was outstanding.  And, while I'm a total sucker for almond cakes, the one we got was almost laughably simple for an $8 restaurant dessert - just a white slice of cake topped with a few poached cherries. Having said that, the crispy fried baby eggplants with ricotta like cheese and honey were fantastic, little exploding packages of crisp.   And we enjoyed the tender, flavorful, stewed tongue with peas and carrots, though wondered why there wasn't any accompanying rice or bread or couscous.  All in all, too expensive for too little.  It's such an attractive restaurant on such an attractive street that I wished for more, but I didn't get it.",3.0 star rating,"Houston, TX",2,1,0.0,9.19999980927,"sucker,concept,bar food,plates,bunch,wall,sticks,restaurant,dinner,nibble,food,Things,snack,blue cheese,olive oil flatbread,onions,baby eggplants,salad,beet,salad,flavor,one,beets,almond cakes,beer,bar stool,top,part,shrimps,melon balls,avocado,drinks,appetizer,La Vara,rice,couscous,bread,carrots,peas,tender,tongue,Spanish,Madrid,Brooklyn,all,more,street,slice,cake,cheese,cherries,restaurant dessert,honey,ricotta","1,7,7,6,5,2,7,2,4,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.555359959602,0.131332799792,0.0317413918674,0.0278555266559,0.0278555266559,0.0278555266559,0.0278555266559,0.0166501142085,0.00871417857707,0.00866272114217,0.00700211245567,0.00623167073354,0.00623167073354,0.00581663660705,0.00509131141007,0.00509131141007,0.00472351629287,0.00390319898725,0.00388562818989,0.00388562818989,0.00371535960585,0.00371088227257,0.00355631718412,0.0035520310048,0.00344009744003,0.00344009744003,0.00344009744003,0.00343039724976,0.0034158222843,0.0034158222843,0.0034158222843,0.00341005530208,0.00340497656725,0.00304431072436,0.0027678150218,0.00231815641746,0.00231815641746,0.00231815641746,0.00231815641746,0.00231815641746,0.00228898064233,0.00203791237436,0.00203791237436,0.00203215959482,0.00183309847489,0.00183149671648,0.00160247320309,0.00143536110409,0.00116509001236,0.00116380560212,0.00101933081169,0.00101933081169,0.00101820693817,0.00101820693817"

It's a lovely little restaurant on a charming street in Cobble Hill...cozy and warm inside and not a table was open on a Saturday night. Bad timing brought the health inspector right during our meal, which meant the kitchen was temporarily shut for a little bit but the staff was friendly and gracious and brought out delicious crispy spiced chickpeas for all the tables to nibble on while we waited.We opted to share a bunch of plates between three people. Highlights included the fried artichokes with anchovy aioli (so perfectly lightly fried), the cumin lamb, and the house made Catalan sausage (don't miss this dish!). Oh, and the shrimp! Quite pricey at $10.50 per shrimp but these are the jumbo kind, head and shell on, cooked in preserved lemon, and dripping with juices when you pull the head off. Totally messy and delicious.

But life is about second chances. I believe it was the poet laureate Two Chainz who said that: ""My whole story is just about me having a second chance.""*This whole story is about La Vara having a second chance. And in my past few visits, they've killed it. Since their inception, the space itself has become more inviting (I love their garden immensely), and the service more welcoming. Most importantly, the consistency of the food has improved considerably.The menu changes often, and it's entirely likely that you could make a meal out of the intriguing specials available. Some of my favorite items have been seasonally available, such as the summer squash fritters or the torn bread served with chorizo oil and grapes. I've never seen more gorgeous deviled eggs than the ones La Vara served with green sauce, and the daily croquetas are never a bad decision.One item that tends to be a staple is the fried artichokes. I'm never sad about dipping into this salty, fatty bomb of flavor, and the bacon paprika stew is a similarly solid choice.Regardless of what you order, however, you are virtually guaranteed a meal of intensely flavorful, beautifully presented small plates. And although you may want more of any given dish, it's just as well that they are tiny portions. Not merely because almost everything is quite rich, but also because this affords you the opportunity to taste more items coming out of this kitchen, and that's a good thing. ______________*He also said, ""My wrist deserve a shout out, I'm like, 'What up wrist?'

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,109519,"I don't really know how to describe how much I love La Vara. I'm more than a little partial because this is where we went to celebrate our engagement after a long walk through Prospect Park, Park Slope, a couple Hill neighborhoods, but that partiality speaks more to my fiancé and my love of the place from before that thrilling moment.You probably want to try for a reservation because it's teeny, and if you're lucky, it'll be a nice day and you will get the honor of a back patio seat.The portions are small, and it's a little expensive. That said, it's a place I know I can count on for an amaaaaaaaazing special treat of a meal.After you order (do get a cocktail, even the simple gin Kas is refreshingly delightful), they bring a tiny amuse bouche. A nice start.The fried artichoke, daily croqueta, and sobresada con miel are our staple ""first course"" tapas. Now, they don't always come out in that order, but they're on the ever so slightly less rich side of the menu, so that's how my brain maps them. The honey with the sobresada is foamed and oh sooooo good.The suckling pig shouldn't be missed out on. It's a pretty simple preparation and the herby green sauce cuts through the fat nicely. We usually get one or two more of the smaller dinner plates, none of which have been disappointing.And olive oil ice cream. OHHH that olive oil ice cream. I have tried on a couple occasions to make it at home since it is my favorite ice cream (and I love, love, love ice cream), but I keep having to come back here. Do make sure to save room for this dessert, or don't because it's more likely there will be some left if I come on the same night. :P",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.90000009537,"partiality,much,engagement,La Vara,place,start.,ice cream,walk,olive oil ice cream,side,Prospect Park,Park Slope,Hill,place,love,reservation,fiancé,neighborhoods,preparation,honor,cocktail,patio,treat,meal.,gin,course,miel,croqueta,artichoke,portions,olive oil ice cream,tapas,order,menu,brain,honey,sobresada,amuse bouche,Kas,OHHH,home,occasions,ice cream,left,more,room,dessert,suckling pig,fat,green sauce cuts,dinner plates,:P","7,7,7,1,7,7,6,4,7,7,2,2,1,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7","0.170576035976,0.0793494358659,0.0597534105182,0.0491015017033,0.0473833456635,0.0467726550996,0.0416808724403,0.0380229279399,0.0283792316914,0.0263469517231,0.0257886759937,0.0225755628198,0.0225755628198,0.0166475251317,0.0166475251317,0.0145697230473,0.0145697230473,0.0145697230473,0.0141445295885,0.0126768667251,0.0126119907945,0.00984157714993,0.00979117956012,0.00979117956012,0.00979117956012,0.00975557882339,0.00975557882339,0.00975557882339,0.00975557882339,0.00923778675497,0.00892946310341,0.00892803538591,0.0089028403163,0.0089028403163,0.0089028403163,0.00888230744749,0.00888230744749,0.00841078069061,0.00710212765262,0.00660327170044,0.00659446232021,0.00659446232021,0.00641508586705,0.00558611005545,0.00469805300236,0.00456072762609,0.00456072762609,0.00291167409159,0.00290598790161,0.00290598790161,0.00290107121691,0.00269983452745"

This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in New York and elsewhere, and I will absolutely be back for a less formal occasion.The food was complex, richly Spanish, and remarkably delicious, presented nicely without trying too hard. Over 6 shared courses we tried a huge variety of meat, seafood, and vegetable plates, including (my favorite) seared duck, seafood stew, octopus, eggplant, pâté, clam, leeks, and olives, all paired (almost) perfectly with 8 different glasses of wine and sherry, ending with a simple but satisfying dessert of chocolate mousse and fruity sorbet.The service was great, timely, and comforting, though slightly unorganized for the event-oriented dinner, but attentive, happy, and more than willing to answer any questions. Everything was knowledgeably explained which led to us enjoying the meal that extra amount to make this easily a 5-star experience.

Well, it must have been a bad night because I was sadly disappointed. We had a table by the kitchen opening and could see the food being spooned out of plastic takeout containers by less than enthusiastic kitchen staff. Maybe because it was a monday night and was slow? But thats not much of an excuse... No complaints on the service which was fast and attentive. The food however: - We started with the sardines, deviled eggs, olives, and sausage spread. Sardines were way too salty but not bad. Deviled eggs (or rather 1 egg) were nothing special. Olives are olives and hard to screw up. The spread was kinda gross with an overly gooey texture. - We thought to try to special of suckling pig. We heard good things about crispy skins etc. At $30 for 1 plate, we were expecting something great but eeekk! The skin was rubbery and overly salty is some places, the meat was overcooked and hard in others, and there was a fowl aftertaste that lingered for a long time after I finished. For $30 a plate (and a portion enough for 1 person)? Really?- Ended the night with olive oil ice cream (which I was very much looking forward too because I've had it elsewhere and loved it).  But even that was obviously kept in the freezer for too long and a little too liberally doused in sea salt. The taste was more vanilla than olive oil. Well that was our night. Had the prices been a bit lower, I might have gone a bit easier on it. But the prices they charge command better quality.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4134,"Raffi M. has the best review. Read his as he nails a lot of my frustrations with this place. Skip mine.I'd avoid the fried dishes. The evening we were there, the specials were monumentally better than the menu items but nothing was really stand out. Oh, and they need a front of house person. We stood there for way too long - no one said a word, so we went up and chatted with the bartender and ended up sitting at the bar. I know it's a different restaurant, but I was really hoping they'd have the uni and wasabi sandwich like they have at their Manhattan location. Also no gin and basil slushie (probably a good thing, actually).Finally, I'll echo Raffi M's comments. It cost way too much money for what it was. Listen, I love to spend money on food. I spend way too much, but when the check arrived little bells went off in my head (I have bells in my head) to signal that something was amiss from a value point-of-view.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",1,0,0.0,4.09999990463,"Raffi M.,review,frustrations,place,lot,restaurant,dishes,menu items,nothing,person,house,way,word,bartender,bar,bells,one,location,uni,wasabi sandwich,slushie,gin,basil,front,money,food,check,specials,something,Manhattan,head,bells,head,value point-of-view,money,comments,thing,Raffi M","1,5,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,2,7,1,2,3,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,1","0.505118072033,0.0813587009907,0.0391759909689,0.0391759909689,0.0391759909689,0.0370623506606,0.0149763729423,0.0149220665917,0.0149220665917,0.0100566633046,0.0100566633046,0.0100334994495,0.0100334994495,0.0100334994495,0.0100334994495,0.010025376454,0.00930018350482,0.00916537642479,0.00916537642479,0.00916537642479,0.0091499062255,0.0091499062255,0.0091499062255,0.00853158067912,0.00779338367283,0.00681975251064,0.00681152800098,0.00647608889267,0.00563312647864,0.00543006602675,0.00539172673598,0.00539172673598,0.00539172673598,0.00471767550334,0.00342549895868,0.00300149619579,0.00300149619579,0.00177679723129"
La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,121572,"If a review was based on just ""how good is the food"", it would get 5 stars. But, since I also consider ""how good was the dining experience"" to be just as important, it only gets 3 stars. Below are some highlights based on my three visits (feel free to skip to ""Summary"" for an expedited read:Food: First of all, yes, the food is awesome, a bit rich, but awesome. Recommendations include: garbanzos fritos (fried chickpeas),fideua (seafood paella), albondigas (lamb meatballs, and pollo asado (half a chicken). Value: I am not 100% sure, but I think the prices listed on their website are not up to date, and reflect a less expensive dining experience. I also would love to recommend the crispy eggplant, and deviled eggs but I just think they are too expensive (I feel like I am eating $5 every time I take a small bite). Restaurant environment: The restaurant is small but surprisingly comfortable. There is a large booth that can accommodate a 6-7 size party. One gripe was how LOUD it was. With less than half the restaurant full on a Tuesday evening, we had to shout to hear each other over the other parties' chatter. Service: They always ask you if you have been there so they can recommend you get the right amount of dishes to share per group which is nice. They also are quite helpful at suggesting menu items. But when they tell you of the specials..get ready for some serious speed talking and in my case, complete zoning out after the 100th special is read. This most recent visit, I asked for a written list of the specials, which they had, but seemed hesitant to fork over (pun intended). Lastly, there is always a frustrating amount of time that passes when you are done eating, and when you can actually leave the restaurant (a common theme with NYC dining that annoys me). Summary: Amazing food, pretty good service, small portion sizes/too expensive for what it is.Final thoughts: Either the portion sizes should be bigger OR the prices should be cheaper. I don't need or want some endless pasta and breadsticks deal, but since this place doesn't strike me as ""fine dining"", it is simply not acceptable to charge $8 for four little pieces of crispy eggplant (which to their credit, does taste amazing).",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,9.0,"food,stars,review,dining experience,stars,visits,highlights,gripe,amount,group,prices,food,booth,pieces,Food,restaurant,menu items,Summary,chickpeas,chicken,food,restaurant,Recommendations,First,read,all,lamb meatballs,albondigas,fritos,seafood paella,fideua,restaurant,amount,theme,bite,dining experience,party,specials,portion sizes,parties,each other,Service,eggplant,website,Value,eggs,Restaurant environment,specials,dining,chatter,dishes,portion sizes,Summary,service,thoughts,prices,dining,crispy eggplant,credit,breadsticks,pasta,deal,place,NYC,special,speed,zoning,case,list,pun,visit","7,1,5,7,7,4,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,5,7,2,7,5,7,7,7,2,7,3,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,4","0.10511738807,0.0925213694572,0.063208013773,0.0411809161305,0.0345290154219,0.034353159368,0.028242552653,0.0277856625617,0.0257704239339,0.0218063555658,0.0210834443569,0.0190536342561,0.0167915858328,0.0158992744982,0.0155646465719,0.013958803378,0.0133372582495,0.0131576489657,0.013109844178,0.013109844178,0.0130602596328,0.0127373412251,0.012377618812,0.011514374055,0.011514374055,0.011514374055,0.0114725241438,0.0114725241438,0.0114725241438,0.0114725241438,0.0114725241438,0.0103554399684,0.010306160897,0.010170458816,0.00897343549877,0.00882964022458,0.00877723935992,0.00877659767866,0.00801086984575,0.00800988264382,0.00800988264382,0.00800021830946,0.00776126747951,0.00772597687319,0.00772597687319,0.00770815368742,0.00769311655313,0.00732542574406,0.00704575050622,0.00700852740556,0.0070000695996,0.00654105469584,0.00594956520945,0.00594956520945,0.00520548596978,0.00504581769928,0.0048711663112,0.00411636615172,0.00360137363896,0.00360137363896,0.00360137363896,0.00360137363896,0.00355599983595,0.00308422860689,0.00287701562047,0.00228920322843,0.00228920322843,0.00228920322843,0.00228705257177,0.00228705257177,0.00208064075559"

I'm glad we tried it but wouldn't order it again. We had several forgettable dishes: flash-fried shishito peppers, fried chickpeas, and olives (which tasted like they came from the bulk display at a supermarket). Nothing bad, but all much more boring than they had to be.And then we had a dish I can only call inexplicable: the remojon. Tons of high quality ingredients that didn't seem to have any connection to one another, dumped on one plate. Confusing and disappointing.The server was nice enough, but seemed like she was trying hard to be in an episode of Girls.

I don't even like anchovies! but I'll eat this. For breakfast lunch and dinner.Also the salt baked fish, the half Murray's chicken, the paella, and pretty much every single thing on the menu. You seriously can't go wrong.The decor and ambiance should also be commended because it's pretty darn cute. I've had great service and as you can tell, a stellar experience every time I've come.

We went during the week and did not have a reservation, however only waited about 10 mins for two seats at the bar. A table was going to be available soon, but we were hungry and not picky about where we were sitting. I would give the food here a 4 but the service was a clear 5 were we were. The bartender was attentive and soooo friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant was featuring a list of specials that all sounded delicious, so we ordered 3 of them: tomato cucumber salad with fried baby shrimp on top, green peppers stuffed with cod, and cauliflower fritters. All were delicious. The salad was particularly tasty and the texture was interesting because of the small crunchy shrimp. After that we ordered the tomato bread with cured tuna and nori and the seafood paella. My other half loved the tomato bread and it might have been his favorite. I, on the other hand, wasn't a huge fan since I am not really into intense fishy flavor. Last, but not least, the seafood paella was amazing. Oh my, so good. It was perfectly seasoned and packed wi seafood. Definitely the favorite for me. The wine selection was good, and the cocktails looked interesting. Dessert would have been amazing but we were stuffed. Overall, you won't be sorry for checking this place out. The food is great, the restaurant is very cute and the staff was pleasant and attentive.

La Vara,5349,268 Clinton St,Brooklyn,11201.0,61,"KenScale: 8.5/10La Vara has long been on my hit list of Brooklyn restaurants. Helmed by chef Alex Raij and her husband Eder Montero (whose other restaurant El Quinto Pino I visited last year and enjoyed my meal), it has been gaining acclaim for its reinterpretation of Spanish cuisine with Moorish and Jewish touch. On my recent dinner, I couldn't quite pinpoint how different influences were all coming together, but didn't really care because the food at La Vara is generally outstanding.The dinner menu consists of mostly shareable tapas plates. Spiced fried chickpeas would be a great snack anywhere at a Spanish restaurant, and the crispy eggplant with honey and melted cheese was also wonderful with its rich complexity of flavor within a single bite. Migas aragonesas, a dish of hand torn bread and chorizo, grapes, rosemary and pastured egg, was another winner. I was deeply impressed with how the different ingredients were coming together yet the dish itself wasn't that heavy but rather delightful and fun. Fideua, a noodle style paella that came with shrimp, squid and clams, also had a nice touch, although I wish the portion were slightly larger. Spanish red shrimp a la plancha was rather small compared to the somewhat hefty price ($21 per two on my last visit), but the crunchy texture of the shrimp was still memorable and I probably could've had at least 5 more of those. On the other hand, pollo asado, a giant half chicken roasted over spiced onions and cumin, was more satisfying in portion and I did like the spicy kick of the otherwise nicely cooked chicken. The winner of the meal on my visit, however, cumin roasted lamb breast. I was absolutely in love with the juicy texture of the meat with great balance of flavor thanks to simple preserved lemon-date condiment. All of the dessert dishes that my dining party tried were great as well. None of them were overly sweet; from homemade olive oil ice cream to Galician almond cake. The best of the bunch was this dish called Egipcio that consisted of orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd and sweet cream. It was absolutely delicious and I couldn't stop digging it!The restaurant, located on a quiet corner of Carroll Gardens, has that cozy neighborhood vibe of a typical restaurant in Brooklyn that I love so much about. Getting a reservation wasn't that difficult, although the restaurant became quickly packed by the start of my meal. There is extensive Spanish wine selection (unfortunately I don't know much about Spanish wine, but the bottle of white that we was crisp and worked well with various dishes). La Vara is one of those places that I would love to come back either for full dinner or even quick wine and snack time. The cooking here is serious and elegant, especially in easily shareable format where you can get a taste of a large number of dishes to explore the culinary beauty of Spain.",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.5,12.6999998093,"10La Vara,Eder Montero,meal,restaurants,Alex Raij,Spanish,hit list,restaurant,Brooklyn,dinner,KenScale,eggplant,touch,reinterpretation,cuisine,acclaim,paella,dessert dishes,restaurant,best,Moorish,Jewish,El Quinto Pino,chickpeas,restaurant,snack,dish,flavor,dinner menu,dish,red shrimp,influences,tapas plates,chicken,bite,complexity,cheese,honey,anywhere,food,texture,shrimp,shrimp,places,winner,aragonesas,format,bread,chicken,meal,touch,visit,hand,La Vara,cumin,portion,lamb breast,visit,winner,cumin,texture,flavor,rosemary,chorizo,grapes,egg,ingredients,fun,clams,squid,more,plancha,price,pollo asado,spicy kick,onions,meat,balance,condiment,love,wine,wine selection,restaurant,dishes,dishes,corner,neighborhood vibe,reservation,start,bottle,Fideua,taste,dinner,one,cooking,restaurant,portion,number,beauty,All,La Vara,Carroll Gardens,olive oil ice cream,cream,dining party,almond cake,bunch,walnut tart,lemon curd,orange blossom,Spain,Egipcio,Galician,None","1,1,7,2,1,2,7,2,2,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,3,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,4,6,1,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,2,6,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,7","0.18269340694,0.0540022701025,0.0509196966887,0.0472863987088,0.0336373560131,0.0335112251341,0.0314322449267,0.0294724516571,0.0196466594934,0.0187375582755,0.0186729617417,0.0172610618174,0.0171373020858,0.015001444146,0.015001444146,0.015001444146,0.0107388300821,0.0103432843462,0.0103141311556,0.00964080635458,0.00889356713742,0.00889356713742,0.00889356713742,0.00874615088105,0.0085871219635,0.00795615650713,0.00688900891691,0.00649719219655,0.00592685677111,0.00578306801617,0.0057088304311,0.00570586649701,0.00570586649701,0.00570031953976,0.00568511197343,0.00568511197343,0.00568511197343,0.00568511197343,0.00568511197343,0.00528825912625,0.00519274407998,0.00478911167011,0.00478101568297,0.0047191795893,0.00466080661863,0.00457061873749,0.00454004481435,0.00437467126176,0.00436868518591,0.00436285650358,0.00435605831444,0.00434869341552,0.00434220768511,0.00424577994272,0.00397360231727,0.00397360231727,0.0039682998322,0.0039682998322,0.0039682998322,0.0039682998322,0.00396350910887,0.00396350910887,0.00382757210173,0.00382757210173,0.00382757210173,0.00382757210173,0.00381873757578,0.00381873757578,0.00381128420122,0.00381128420122,0.00380483921617,0.00380483921617,0.00380483921617,0.0037991637364,0.00347660761327,0.00347660761327,0.00346777564846,0.00346777564846,0.00346777564846,0.00346777564846,0.00323779392056,0.00315586407669,0.00298588094302,0.00269582052715,0.00269202166237,0.00258055166341,0.00258055166341,0.0025784408208,0.0025784408208,0.00257645966485,0.0024040301796,0.00229536113329,0.00224003661424,0.00221119937487,0.00218184106052,0.00204282440245,0.00188674218953,0.00178116583265,0.00178116583265,0.00171470688656,0.00162418931723,0.00152749626432,0.00129588926211,0.00129467179067,0.00113484228496,0.00113369070459,0.0011326255044,0.0011326255044,0.0011326255044,0.0011326255044,0.00105421349872,0.000980746350251,0.000670939916745,0.000490761245601"

La Vega Restaurant,5350,8909 139th St,Jamaica,11435.0,13454,"Extremely disappointed. Ordered through Seamless last night. I got the ""Paella a La Valenciana,"" chicken tamales, and chicken empanadas. The paella wasn't even close to authentic; it was simply a plate of rice (not saffron rice as I expected, but something tinted red--probably just a paprika seasoning) with meat on top. It was clear that none of it had been cooked together and there was no broth on the rice or meat. The meat ""toppings"" were giant chicken chunks (under-seasoned), shrimp (okay, a little garlicky), and mussels that had been cut in half (making it hard to trust that they were safe for eating, since we couldn't tell if they'd opened fully during the cooking process). None of it tasted fresh. The tamales were okay--at first I was impressed at how huge they were, but upon eating realized they were mostly masa and very little filling. At least they were more edible than the ""paella."" The empanadas were fine. I don't think there's much you can do to mess that up. I didn't get to try anything else from their rather extensive menu and doubt I'll be ordering with them again, but I thought it was especially odd that they didn't offer the option to purchase sides (beans, rice, plantains) separately. If you're in Jamaica, you're much (MUCH) better off going to Sangria. If you're ordering from Seamless, you may order from Latin Cabana in LIC.

It was prepared in a Latin manner (butterflied thin) but didn't have any flavor and was pink/raw in certain spots! My girlfriend got the chicken enchiladas and the hot sauce on top was hot/spicy but had a weird taste to it and wasn't that appealing. Second star gets knocked off because of the service and music. There is a electronic juke box that is wayyyyyy to loud. It felt like I was back home in a backyard party. The service was decent but we didn't even get anything to drink! No cups for water or anything.Overall, did not think that the taste of the food was worth the price. Back in Miami, you could have had a similar meal for less $$. Will likely not be returning.

The food here is a fusion of Latin American cuisines which was exciting. My favorite was the can't believe it's not steak veggie bowl.

Usually I eat before I get to the airport and just snack on the plane, this time I had to do things differently. After some debating on spots in Terminal 5 I chose La Vie.The four stars is because for airport food in NYC this was pretty good. Better than some bars I've been in, and that's saying a lot! I had the calamari as an appetizer, it was ok. It comes with an aioli that can be switched for a marinara, I wasn't aware so I ate them plain. I had the La Vie burger and it was definitely better than expected. Tasted fresh, made to how I ordered it and juicy. No complaints at all.

I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese and the pomme frites (which were basically just frozen soggy fries). But surprisingly the beet salad was delicious! And made with both red and golden beets. I was pleasantly surprised.The biggest problem was my food came out 35/40 minutes after I sat down. And I did not have much time before my flight so that was a little nerve wracking.

I found service on several occasions to be quite friendly and quick.

La Vienesa Bakery,5354,3944 Queens Blvd,Sunnyside,11104.0,2104,"The endless sea of Colombian bakeries from Queens Blvd to Roosevelt begins here at La Vienesa, a quality local eatery on the edge of LIC and Sunnyside. Whether one is here for breakfast or lunch, there is plenty to eat and even more to appreciate.Like all Latin bakeries, daytime is always the time to come. Fresh out of the oven pastries (complete with the ""bakery aroma"") and the smell of coffee / breakfast make this place a pseudo greasy spoon for all visitors. Between 7am-9am, it's commuters from the hood, and 9am-3pm is the locals crowd. You should aim for anytime in between.For the Pan (bread) lovers, they've got quite the variety. Pan de: yuca, quesa, bono, maiz, etc, you name it, they have it. They ought to have a ""pan de todo"" there is so much. Add to that the bunelos, sancocho, arepas, almojabana, empanadas, and it's easy to get lost in the shuffle.There is a good variety of hot plates, none of which come more stacked than the classic bandeja paisa ($10), which is practically a staple combination of chicharron, corn arepa, plantain, rice, beans, and topped off with a fried egg. Some Colombians throw in some type of red meat but I think the version here includes chicken. Very impressive. Big ups to their carne asada ($10) platter as well.Me personally, I'm a sucker for breakfast. I love their breakfast sandwiches, which range from $1.50-$3. What most folks might pay $8 for in a diner for breakfast, would come out to roughly $3 here. Is there a catch? Not getting ripped off, that's the catch.The staff that works here is a friendly bunch. They're always full of smiles and super amiable, shaking hands and giving kisses to their regulars. It is a real community out in these parts and La Vienesa is truly in the thick of it. Are they a Queens Blvd gem or a Sunnyside win?

Their timing was perfect. I even helped myself to 3 beautiful bread slices guilt free since it would have been a shame to leave them behind.The different cheeses in my dishes that I had the pleasure of eating were cooked to perfection. Everything in between was just as enjoyable and delicious with every bite. I can't wait to go back for the pasta and everything else on the menu. I only wish I had more space in my stomach. The service was better than when I've been to the many michelin starred restaurants in nyc. I'm not talking about the hurried waiter who makes obligatory rounds after each serving. The service people here I feel are genuine and made my wonderful meal all that much better. The only thing I didn't like were the veggies that were cooked past my personal preference. (I like them very al dente) I'm sure most people would find that they were cooked to perfection and bright in color. Pricing for the quality is very reasonable. I don't know if it's because I'm used to city pricing, but I feel that I would have easily paid more.  I salute their impeccable attention to detail and I think I will soon become a regular.

Everyone who knows me knows I only get down with Moscato, so yay!  The Moscato was everything, perfect chill, smooth and sweet, it was yum!

The waitstaff is extremely attentive (upon seeing me walk toward the direction of the bathroom, the waiter pulled the curtain and turned on the light - sweet).

I was tempted to request the sauce for a drink. As an entree, I had potato encrusted red snapper and it was enormous; with veggies, and more potatoes. My date had the pounded veal. Normally, I'd engage in the obligatory moral gasp when someone orders veal, but it was a date and I'm not nuts. The veal was also enormous and something about how pounded it was felt decadent.

I don't think any of the options there include the fresh pasta, though.for dessert, they brought out some excellent fresh cheesecake with citrus chunks. the coffee was also pretty good.the ambience here is relaxed but warm; low music and candles set the tone. service is great.yeah, we'll be back.",4.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS, NY",1,0,0.699999988079,4.90000009537,"fusion dishes,restaurant,neighborhood,lots,any,Italian,place,birthday dinner,fusilli,pasta dishes,pasta dishes,one,broccoli,lock,broccoli rabe,sausage,soup,dinner menu,appetizer,garlic,cheesecake,Caroline,ambience,dessert,citrus chunks,coffee,tone,candles,music,service,pasta,dessert,entrée,salad,options","7,2,2,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.292805254459,0.0590405538678,0.0590405538678,0.0536840222776,0.0374298654497,0.0351059362292,0.0345170125365,0.0322223380208,0.0258699636906,0.0239478610456,0.0238255541772,0.0202115122229,0.0197705067694,0.019071245566,0.018973749131,0.018973749131,0.0173036754131,0.0173036754131,0.0173036754131,0.0173036754131,0.0170380976051,0.0167318619788,0.0157566443086,0.0147394090891,0.0128986956552,0.0128689659759,0.00891408231109,0.00891408231109,0.00891408231109,0.00889669451863,0.00711483601481,0.00648978119716,0.00567813729867,0.00567813729867,0.00566210085526"

The service was out of this world incredible. The wine selection was not limited, the glass of Malbec complimented everything perfectly. My boyfriend ordered a stuffed chicken that was tender, full of flavor, rich and decadent. I am not a huge fan of poultry, but this entree was one of the best pieces of chicken I have ever eaten. My orecchiette pasta entree was watery and salty. I did not have the heart to send it back during my meal because everything else was exceptional. The last thing I would have wanted was the chef to come out of the kitchen to apologize, and remake my entree (I would have felt completely embarrassed). Overall, i can see myself visiting again in the future. I am saddened that my entree was not what I thought it would be (perhaps less pachetta would make this better).

La Vigna Restaurant,5355,10011 Metropolitan Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,158943,"As I think of all the amazing restaurant experiences that I have put to paper, I realize that one is truly overdue. Seven years ago, after Babbo refused my eight-month pregnant wife and I a seat after waiting over an hour in line (by the way, that was the last time I ever went to Babbo), we found ourselves searching for a dining experience that would not disappoint. Our search took us out of the city and slowly making our way toward home. We were hungry, tired and truly disappointed--until we happened upon La Vigna. It was an eye-opening experience. The staff provided perfect service, the food was absolutely amazing, rivaling anything I could have hoped for--and the wine (oh, the wine): a bottle of 2001 Guado al Tasso for only $95 dollars. It was on that night that I realized I had been shortsighted for a very long time. Trekking out to the city in search of a superior Italian meal had become completely unnecessary. Now fast forward seven years and, to this day, I continue to visit La Vigna whenever possible. Anytime I need to show weary foodies that great cuisine exists in Queens, I take them to La Vigna. Wine dinners and tastings close to home? I go to La Vigna. Birthdays, anniversaries, and visiting family are all great reasons for me to head to La Vigna. Yet somehow I have never put these thoughts to paper. An oversight--maybe, or possibly, I just wanted to keep it secret, in fear of ruining my little find. However, if I have learned anything in these seven years, it's that La Vigna is here to stay and they march to the beat of their own drum, remaining unchanged in all the right ways.Located on Metropolitan Ave in Forest Hills Queens, La Vigna finds itself tucked into small, unassuming spot that makes it very easy to pass unnoticed. However, stepping in the door, you are greeted by a friendly, knowledgeable staff that caters to locals and new faces alike. It's close and personal, yet uncramped, with visions of Italy decorating the walls. You'll find it easy to fall into a comfortable state at La Vigna, surrounded by wood tones, Tuscan colors and candlelight and enjoying a plate a fresh made pasta, or my favorite, the Costoleta di Vitello alla Vigna. Of course, the real treat here is the food, which I find comparable to anything you will find at the best Italian restaurants in the city and there's a good reason why; before opening his restaurant, Chef Vitale worked with Lidia Bastianich at the famed Felidia, as well as Becco and her original location in Forest Hills, Bona Via. I urge you to take a trek of your own and find La Vigna. I guarantee you, you'll find yourself thanking me later.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,13.1999998093,"La Vigna,restaurant experiences,treat,one,paper,experience,dining experience,Birthdays,way,wine,wife,seat,line,foodies,Babbo,food,way,search,city,anything,home,staff,Chef Vitale,Lidia Bastianich,spot,city,restaurant,search,anything,service,home,Italian,paper,bottle,meal,cuisine,tastings,dinners,anniversaries,family,thoughts,fear,find,drum,beat,oversight,anything,restaurants,Costoleta di Vitello alla Vigna,state,wood tones,colors,candlelight,pasta,favorite,Queens,plate,reason,Guado al Tasso,city,trek,location,course,Tuscan,locals,staff,faces,door,walls,visions,Felidia,Becco,Bona Via,Forest Hills Queens,Metropolitan Ave,Italy","1,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,4,2,7,2,1,1,1,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,3,2,4,2,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2","0.14758002758,0.14135992527,0.0564994364977,0.0551183559,0.0514740645885,0.0414243228734,0.0262913964689,0.0261153168976,0.0245957318693,0.0232518333942,0.0215314496309,0.0215314496309,0.0215314496309,0.0151569852605,0.014587931335,0.0121788466349,0.012058230117,0.0104911373928,0.0102911712602,0.0102012660354,0.00936136394739,0.00927956402302,0.00794196035713,0.00784200243652,0.00717738131061,0.00686388649046,0.0066149123013,0.00624328758568,0.00622642785311,0.00622319430113,0.00621814653277,0.00579626532272,0.00567298103124,0.00548251811415,0.00546256639063,0.00544714042917,0.00544056482613,0.00544056482613,0.00542905880138,0.00542905880138,0.00496349437162,0.00495915627107,0.00495915627107,0.00495510129258,0.00495510129258,0.00489669758826,0.00463896431029,0.00463896431029,0.00383577821776,0.00369389471598,0.00369389471598,0.00369389471598,0.00369389471598,0.00369389471598,0.00369389471598,0.00368610280566,0.00364735815674,0.00340128666721,0.00324587407522,0.00321182678454,0.00297387200408,0.00292120641097,0.00282854237594,0.00218656798825,0.00185428943951,0.00185428943951,0.00162220548373,0.00162220548373,0.00162102980539,0.00162102980539,0.00151264120359,0.00151264120359,0.00151264120359,0.00109828438144,0.000960801495239,0.000959366909228"

La Vigna Restaurant,5355,10011 Metropolitan Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,18769,"Came in for the lunch special. The Caesar dressing was exceptional: fresh, and one could clearly taste every ingredient. Fresh lettuce and crunchy croutons. Service is a bit slow, just one waiter/busboy for 6 tables, but it didn't detract from the meal. The bread plate (the little tray they give you while you wait) was disappointing: not stale but definitely not fresh. Soda is from a tap and not well mixed: the syrupy taste is evident.The entrees my wife and I received were both truly excellent. I had the spaghetti puttanesca: flavorful, rich but not heavy or too salty and the pasta was perfectly al dente. My wife's chicken cacciatore was also very tasty: the chicken tender, the vegetable also tender but not mushy and still with a little crunch.

My lunch also included tea which I always enjoy. I went again with some friends from my book club. We were a party of 6 without a reservation and they were very accommodating. We had a table within minutes. The wines/cocktails were tasty and priced fairly. I ordered the special, pumpkin ravioli and shared it with a friend. As a previous poster mentioned it was a bit salty and mine could have been cooked slightly longer. My friend had the stuffed chicken (I cannot recall what the actual name was) and shared that with me, that was excellent.

We were seated quickly though because we only needed a table of 2.  Our waiters were really nice and made sure we were happy throughout the night.  My wife and I checked into yelp individually - which came with a ""free 1 glass of wine with 1 entree yelp checkin offer"".  After we ordered our food, we asked the waiter, which had to verify with a manager first before giving us the free glass of wine (wine is also limited to certain types with this offer).  Service was fast with a friendly vibe and attitude. We ordered the following:- Clams and mussels in white wine sauce (for appetizer)- Black linguine pasta with seafood- Crab risottoin addition to the stuff we ordered, the restaurant places a plate of olives, small cubed cheeses, and pickled peppers, with a basket of bread and butter) the entrees were pretty massive and were cooked very well, and the restaurant uses fresh natural ingredients (on their menu - their steaks are all marked as ""grass fed"" - thats always a good sign!).  The linguine was cooked just right and caters to your inner italian.  The Crab risotto was a lot more subtle with real crab meat layered over a heaping portion of risotto.  We werent able to finish our meal, so we took the rest of our unfinished food to go.  There is a parking lot next to the restaurant, but its for Sizzler, so just find street parking, which isnt too bad to look for a spot.  All in all, the restaurant had a great atmosphere, friendly staff and service, pretty darn good italian food, very affordable pricing, and excellent decor.",4.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.90000009537,"atmosphere,wife,place,yelp,choice,weekends,ingredients,street parking,people,wife,Service,wine,wine,wine,table,food,waiter,restaurant,entree yelp checkin offer,glass,offer,glass,rest,restaurant,manager,types,vibe,attitude,Clams,mussels,sauce,appetizer,pasta,addition,seafood,stuff,restaurant,parking lot,olives,butter,basket,plate,cheeses,peppers,bread,risotto,food,Crab risottoin,waiters,restaurant,crab meat,portion,meal,all,food,atmosphere,service,spot,staff,pricing,decor,entrees,Crab risotto,Sizzler,steaks,linguine,sign,grass,menu,italian","7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,6,6,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,3,6,6,7,7,7,2","0.11008336395,0.0925025492907,0.0811112597585,0.0471743941307,0.0388516448438,0.0388516448438,0.0321028083563,0.0239263474941,0.0168906655163,0.0168109294027,0.0135004241019,0.0134353116155,0.0134043497965,0.0134043497965,0.0125616816804,0.0124554000795,0.0123800002038,0.0118786655366,0.0113563966006,0.0113563966006,0.0113302152604,0.0113302152604,0.0106913270429,0.0102043775842,0.00991444382817,0.00991444382817,0.00989510864019,0.00989510864019,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00987839046866,0.00965068209916,0.00940671004355,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00904034357518,0.00846394151449,0.00845372863114,0.00735107297078,0.00731056928635,0.00711349165067,0.00673614349216,0.00673614349216,0.00672801304609,0.00584179675207,0.00584179675207,0.00531341927126,0.00531341927126,0.00465348735452,0.00464876741171,0.00464876741171,0.00464876741171,0.00447685318068,0.00443485891446,0.00397903192788,0.00349436141551,0.00338207907043,0.00296329474077,0.00296329474077,0.00296329474077,0.00295887212269"

I went to my Yelp app on my phone and saw that they offered a glass of wine if you checked in. So of course I checked in and asked for a glass of Riesling. The only bad thing is that they were definitely understaffed. Our entire stay at this place was over 3 hours because we waited forever for anything we asked for -- and over an hour to get our food. We gave them the benefit of the doubt because they were good besides that. However, I did notice that a group of 3 people came in and stood by the door for about 15 minutes before they were seated (there were plenty of empty seats, but they were not acknowledged). I guess they were pretty patient because I would have walked out.

La Vigna Restaurant,5355,10011 Metropolitan Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,134854,"My mother wanted to try this ""new"" neighbourhood restaurant during my recent visit, so we headed out for dinner, learning that the place has been open for 13 years... The menu is extensive, and to my mind a bit expensive, too, but the servings are huge. I started with a special, the octopus carpaccio, which I loved, and followed it with another special, veal saltimbocca, which was delicious and enormous. My mother's risotto with wild mushrooms was less successful, to my mind, with a slightly too watery consistency that led her to question whether they used Arborio rice (I think they do, but perhaps they don't cook it long enough?).

La Vigna Restaurant,5355,10011 Metropolitan Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,6739,"After passing by this restaurant for so many years, I finally decided to give this place a try... and I wasn't disappointed at all! First off, the service was top notch! My friends and I walked in around 12:45/1pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately. We were given menus and told the soups of the day. Their lunch menu was quite extensive unlike other place where they only give you 2-3 options for appetizers and entrées. After ordering, we were given a fresh basket of bread - we probably could've eaten two or three baskets since the bread was so fresh! For appetizers, we ordered the Mozzarella Corrozza basically a fried Italian grilled cheese, stuffed mushrooms with cheese and herbs then broiled so the top is nice and crisp, as well as the mussels -perfect amount of mussels in one of the best tomato based sauces ever! I was so tempted to keep the sauce to dip my bread into it. All of our appetizers were amazing! So flavorful and plentiful, though I wish they had given us one or two more stuffed mushrooms. For entrées, we ordered the Veal Sorrentino - cooked to perfection, topped with cheese, prosciutto, eggplant, and herbs, in a delectable tomato based sauce, Medagiloni Di Maiale alla Pizzaiola - pork sautéed with a blend of mushrooms, peppers, onions, garlic in a tomato sauce, and the Spaghetti Puttanesca which came in a heaping bowl of perfectly cooked and seasoned spaghetti, with olives, capers, garlic, and anchovies in a light tomato sauce. Such good food for only $17 a person!! We ended our meals with coffee- nice fragrant and strong coffee to wash everything down and leave us feeling full and happy!

Gave us a basket of regular bread and homemade garlic bread which was amazing! Gave us a sense of how the rest of the food would be. The party ordered some from the lunch specials menu and some from the regular menu. The mussels fra diavlo from the lunch specials was delicious - and a good size portion too!

With one drink each and tax, the bill comes to about $50 for two without the tip. The table is set impeccably with white linen, and squeaky clean glasses and the restaurant is beautifully decorated so you really feel as you would sitting down for an expensive meal. Fresh country bread slices and crisp crackers come with butter after you are seated. The wait staff is always smiling, welcoming and professionally dressed. The food is fresh! And clearly cooked, no microwaving here. The sauces have a depth of flavor that only comes from long simmering.

It was very traditional looking with paintings and photographs of Italy on the wall. I loved the decor and it was very cozy and warm. The service was excellent and very nice.The bread the serve with extra virgin olive oil was home made and delicious.

La Vigna Restaurant,5355,10011 Metropolitan Ave,Forest Hills,11375.0,52987,"On a quiet Wednesday night in Forest Hills most of the other restaurants on the block were just about empty, but La Vigna was doing a good business. Unfortunately, the wait staff wasn't able to keep up.I'm hoping it was a fluke, perhaps someone called in sick or perhaps it's usually not that crowded, but the two waiters (one of whom I'm guessing was regularly just a bus boy) were overwhelmed.We started our dinner with a very professional waiter with an Italian accent who explained the specials and brought out menus. So far so good. However, as our food came a younger waiter took over (the likely bus boy) and he wasn't up to the job. He asked if we wanted pepper with our entrees and we said yes. Then we waited. I watched him as he took care of other customers and then remembered to get the pepper grinder from another table. Then he got confused and put the pepper grinder down on the bar in the back. Then a couple of minutes later he realized we were waiting and brought the pepper grinder out. I had already given up and started eating, my wife didn't and her food starting getting cold.This set the tone for the rest of the night. We'd regularly wait 5-10 minutes for the waiter to show up. Our water glass stayed empty for nearly 30 minutes before they were refilled and the ice-teas we ordered stayed empty for the entire night, seemingly forgotten. Sometimes our ""waiter"" would be legitimately busy bringing food to other tables, but for a good deal of the time he was either wandering around confused or doing less important tasks, like setting tables that were almost certainly not going to be needed. (The restaurant was busier than anywhere else that night but still only three-quarters full).Our original waiter came back only to bring us the check, which took even longer to take care of, especially as we were using a Yelp offer. He was annoyed that I only had the offer on my phone as if writing the offer code down on the check was too much work for him. It took a good ten minutes for them to process the Yelp offer - I think they had to call it in by phone (never had that with any other discount program).Outside of the extraordinarily slow service the rest of our meal was pretty good. I had a classic veal parmigiana that was good but not memorable. My wife had a special, the osso bucco ravioli, which was really very good but somewhat small (she was still a bit hungry after dinner). We also shared a lemon gelato tartufo that was delicious.This isn't really a 3 star place - it's a 4 star place that, at least on the night we were there, had 1 star service.",3.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, NY",3,0,-0.10000000149,9.0,"fluke,wife,restaurants,lemon gelato tartufo,block,business,bus boy,La Vigna,waiters,Forest Hills,wait staff,one,offer,someone,up.,most,accent,waiter,waiter,food,veal parmigiana,menus,bus boy,waiter,dinner,pepper grinder,pepper grinder,specials,job,restaurant,ravioli,pepper,rest,waiter,care,table,pepper grinder,food,tables,rest,entrees,customers,bar,back,tone,water glass,food,ice-teas,setting tables,tasks,deal,anywhere,Italian,check,service,phone,Yelp,meal,discount program,star place,dinner,star service,waiter,offer code,offer,care,work,check,phone","1,1,2,7,2,7,1,1,1,2,1,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,6,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6","0.100334063172,0.0691134557128,0.0619114749134,0.0476135760546,0.0459528006613,0.0459528006613,0.0439221709967,0.0429701805115,0.0345774926245,0.0273251086473,0.0261980816722,0.0261980816722,0.0243031010032,0.0219583846629,0.0214111991227,0.0200241282582,0.0155761819333,0.0147234033793,0.0132555402815,0.0115755070001,0.0114787621424,0.0110981483012,0.0102273030207,0.00980024319142,0.00960015691817,0.00923958979547,0.00903730560094,0.00840076990426,0.00832736585289,0.00817802641541,0.00794635247439,0.00758253736421,0.00751626864076,0.00706621818244,0.00706178275868,0.00701540149748,0.00700354669243,0.00698378030211,0.00636999122798,0.00610098754987,0.00560727715492,0.00558342272416,0.00557398423553,0.00557398423553,0.00555824674666,0.00554542103782,0.00547156203538,0.00507472408935,0.00506957946345,0.00506957946345,0.00506957946345,0.00506482087076,0.00497546605766,0.00465532066301,0.00431777630001,0.00431777630001,0.004015320912,0.00377768953331,0.00377768953331,0.00370044354349,0.00298503693193,0.0029829912819,0.00262132799253,0.00245677516796,0.00224306550808,0.00220883940347,0.00198032450862,0.00189535378013,0.00189535378013"

It was a larger portion than one might expect and served in a killer red sauce.- The Stuffed Mushrooms were on the small side but I loved the seasoning in the stuffing.- The salmon was a huge piece, cooked to perfection with a zesty mustard sauce.- The Tiramisu wasn't bad.  It was a little on the small side and wasn't as tall as some others I've had.  The ratio in my piece was more mascarpone than ladyfingers but it was tasty enough.The wines by the glass are reasonably priced ($7-8) and large bar pours.  Take advantage of your Yelp check in for a free glass of wine!  I tried the Chianti and the Pinot Grigio and enjoyed both.The restaurant is cozy, so I recommend making a reservation.  Our table was waiting for us the minute we walked in, and staff was very attentive for a bumping Sunday evening.  We definitely enjoyed our low key family meal and I will be back to try more of the menu.",4.0 star rating,"Boonton, NJ",2,1,0.699999988079,9.0,"Italian restaurant,pris fixe menu,family,celebration,most,salmon,portion,cooking,home,side,mascarpone,Italian American,range,points,bill,cuisine,visit,table.,sauce.,favorite,seasoning,appetizers,oil,bottle,bread basket,perfection,restaurant,mustard,others,more,La Vigna,reservation,wine,glass,table,The Eggplant Rollatini,one,Chianti,The Tiramisu,staff,menu,family meal,Pinot Grigio,advantage,glass,wines,piece,bar,ladyfingers,The Stuffed Mushrooms,Yelp","2,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,4,6,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,1,7,1,7,6,7,7,5,1,7,5,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,2,7,3,7","0.263025105,0.118829198182,0.0900806039572,0.0601993277669,0.0353072024882,0.0315623506904,0.02988788113,0.0288802776486,0.0288802776486,0.0263170599937,0.0232541561127,0.0212563574314,0.0181929711252,0.0127391656861,0.011017148383,0.0109771471471,0.0109771471471,0.0084503851831,0.00843091122806,0.0078779971227,0.00766336871311,0.00739485910162,0.00739485910162,0.00739485910162,0.00739485910162,0.00737781170756,0.00701629184186,0.00675212033093,0.00673895468935,0.0065707010217,0.00652871187776,0.0064585362561,0.00573714450002,0.00573714450002,0.00572258187458,0.00523012364283,0.00491958623752,0.0048263175413,0.00477524613962,0.00414054794237,0.00395865971223,0.00341993710026,0.00296849501319,0.00256434292533,0.0025211405009,0.0025211405009,0.0025211405009,0.00220569991507,0.00220569991507,0.00189284479711,0.00130362086929"

They have a brick oven!!They brought out delicious bread studded with onions, (FOR FREE!!!) and it was probably my favorite thing.The only issue was they were out of the desserts we really wanted to try, but we settled on red velvet cake and it was better than expected :).When we came the place had ample seating available, although on a crowded night it could get annoying, because the tables are all right next to each other.",5.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",1,0,0.20000000298,3.59999990463,"deal,Groupon,brick oven,place,cheese,walnuts,lemon vinaigrette,thing,boyfriend,bread,pizza,salad,tastes,side,slice,onions,cheese pizza,red velvet cake,seating,each other,tables,issue,desserts","7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7","0.224905997515,0.135206803679,0.0624093152583,0.0571568198502,0.0477600805461,0.0418229103088,0.0418229103088,0.0413155704737,0.0360914617777,0.0337628610432,0.0319699905813,0.0309009589255,0.0281847361475,0.0281054265797,0.0269982591271,0.0255748759955,0.0236566867679,0.0191226005554,0.0191226005554,0.0132486699149,0.0124359494075,0.0100270984694,0.00839741900563"

So far the best pizza in MHO has been either Serious Pie in Seattle, or Inbound Pizza in Allston/Brookline.So far the ny pizzas haven't really gotten my attention. Except until now.While out and about just happened to come across this place. Looked nice,seemed homey, wood fired pizza...Why not right?So looking around at all the other pizzas being served and my tummy was grumbling. Then looking at the menu saw deep dish.Now I am usually NOT a fan of deep dish. It somehow ends up a pile of slop and grease more than anything.But I felt adventurous, so went after the siciliana pizza with fennel sausage and peppers along with a mixed green salad with white balsamic vinegarette.First off, bootle that dressing for me and GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!With dressing like that I salad all day long, every day.Then the pizza came out, and holy crap i wanted to take a picture of it it was so pretty.

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,54923,"Here's the thing: this is THE BEST RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK.Ok, this is a bold claim, sure. But you know what? I'm sticking to it. I came here weekly, every week, for about a year. The consistency (ALWAYS great) and variety (EVERY item on the menu is amazing) are what take it to the next level, and made it worth the return every. Single. Week. At least once. Here's a typical meal: you start with the bread basket. My theory on Italian restaurants - if the bread isn't good, the restaurant isn't good. La Villa bread is absolutely the best bread I've ever had. There are two kinds, a garlicy bread and onion bread, and they're both just amazing. Careful though! It's really easy to fill up on these.If you sit at the bar, you'll sometimes get their little cheese sticks and rice balls with your meal. The rice balls are delicious and I have no idea how to describe them, but just know that if you *can* get them, you *should* get them.Then, where to start? My go-to meals were either a pizza, pasta, meat, or salad (for those nights when the stomach doesn't feel its best). Here are my recommendations:Pizza:Get the Focaccia Della Nonna. If you don't like it, I will personally write you an apology poem. I don't plan on practicing my poetry any time soon.Pasta:** Italian Mac and Cheese - creamy, heavy, and delicious, just like grandma used to make it (if your grandma didn't make Kraft easy mac and was a professional Italian chef somehow)** Pasta La Villa - baked, cheesy, filled with your veggies for the day (PEAS!), and somehow taking a bunch of random ingredients and turning it into a magical dish of delightfulness. Get it baked for a waiter-recommended improvement.** Baked Ziti - ask for the bolognese sauce on this bad boy and you won't ever get another pasta dish. This was my go-to and remains a top 2 favorite pasta dish in the entire world.Meat:** Chicken balsamico - the locals love it. If you've ever eaten chicken and liked it, you'll LOVE this dish.** The steak special - only ever had it once. Wish I could have had it every day. If you see it on the menu, seize the carpe and order it! Don't miss your chance! It's AMAZING!Service:** If you have two or three people and you can sit at the bar, DO IT. If you see a youngish guy wandering around and screaming, that's who you want to befriend immediately. Never a dull moment and his recommendations are always spot on.Writing this review just re-awoke the craving for La Villa, and even though it's a 40 minute train ride away I want to come back as soon as I can.

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,139549,"My friend and I came here two days in a row. Once on a Friday afternoon. Then again on a Saturday night. Call us lazy...or call us fans...On Friday afternoon, we stood outside looking at the menu for something affordable along 5th Avenue. While standing there, a guy walks past us and inside the restaurant and tells us it's very good pizza and that they use a wood fired oven. We aren't completely sold but figure that we might as well try. We split a mixed green salad with traditional balsamic vinaigrette. Then continue to order a vegetale pizza on whole wheat crust. Then we are greeted by a basket of focaccia bread. One is regular and the other is topped with red onions. They are delicious. The salad is pretty good. As far as the pizza goes, we should have gone with something more traditional and on regular crust. It is okay.The next night, we are lazy about cooking. Craving some good salad from La Villa and the memorable focaccia bread. Would it be weird to go to the restaurant two days in a row? Maybe...but who cares?!On Saturday night, we enter a packed restaurant. People are standing around waiting for their names to get called. Although packed, the tables get turned over pretty quickly. There are families, couples, friends, young, old. We put our names on the wait list and wait perhaps twenty minutes. The service is very attentive (hostess, foodrunner, and server included). We order the salad and one of the specials (eggplant lasagna). We share both meals and are unable to finish. Talk about big portions. We pack up the lasagna and salad for next day's workshop. Lessons of two days of La Villa?1.)  Focaccia bread with the red onions on top are a must.2.) Salad is great split into two for $9 and as an appetizer.3.) Whole wheat pizza is not-so-great.

But, I took a pal there last night and was reminded of its convenient goodness. It sort of surprises me that they don't add ""family restaurant"" to their name, but that's a good thing. We strolled in at 6:30pm, thinking we'd beat the crowds, but then I remembered where we were. It was a mob scene - wall to wall families - and this place is vast by inner Brooklyn standards. Nonetheless, there was a couple tables for two, plus a few comfy stools at the bar (also a highly recommended perch for non-breeders). The down side is this: it is almost always crowded with a wait - with families early on and then with the kidless crew later at night. My pal is a picky eater, sort of a foodie snob, but he was impressed with the choices and what came to the table (I could tell he was nervous when he saw the nuclear units devouring huge plates of pizza/pasta all around - worried that it might be a local version of some tasteless family feed chain like Macaroni Grill). The wait staff is good, and they let you chow in peace and sit for a long time - I've never been rushed, even at peak time. For what it is, the check is often shockingly high though.

We waited while the rest of the food got cold to get a missing main attraction of the entree. Neither the spaghetti vongole nor the lasagna were appetizing.

It's definitely one of those places that when I enter I know what to expect. I know I can always expect great service, excellent food, and an overall pleasant dining experience.The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The decor is clean and sleek. The menu is extensive including salads, pizzas, pasta dishes and more. The last 2 times I've been to La Villa I've ordered the exact same thing...homemade meatballs and calamari! Each dish has been prepared to perfection. I've also had the lasagna and tried a slice of my boyfriend's pizza. I've been impressed with everything consumed here except the complimentary bread provided at each table. The only thing wrong with the bread is that it had onions on it; I'm sure anyone who likes onions will love the free bread. The service is consistently friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.

I think we had calamari and a spinach dish as our apps they were okay, nothing I couldn't live without. One other thing I remember about the experience was the balsamic vinaigrette!!!

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,71956,"I love Italian food. I have made it my life's mission to eat family-style Italian food in as many restaurants as possible in every city I visit, or live in. I've been to La Villa three times since late 2012 and it never, ever fails to disappoint. Came here on NYE with my bf at 6:30 and were seated within 10 minutes (FYI: they don't take reservations). They bring out homemade focaccia bread and it was so difficult to not eat the entire basket. Once I'd exercised incredible restraint with regards to the bread basket, I ordered the rigatoni with vodka sauce and it was THE MOST PERFECT vodka sauce I've ever had. It wasn't pink alfredo sauce, like at other places. It was so good. I don't really know how to write about food (and yet here I am) so all I can really say is that it was very light and flavorful and didn't make me feel like I wanted to explode (in a bad way). My bf got the linguini with shrimp and he was RENDERED SPEECHLESS by the tomato sauce. We are both pretty picky about tomato sauce so it was a Christmas Miracle that we were both like, omfg. It was really oily and sweet and fresh.But honestly, the real reason I wanted to go back after not having been for THREE AND A HALF YEARS was so that I could get the DESSERT CALZONE. People!! Save room and get the dessert calzone!! It's baked fresh in their wood-burning oven and filled with with homemade sweet ricotta and Nutella and topped with powdered sugar, which gets all over your face and makes you look crazy. EAT HALF OF YOUR DINNER ENTREE SO THAT YOU CAN ORDER THE DESSERT CALZONE!! It's so good. It comes split in half, oozing sweet ricotta and Nutella, and my bf and I each ate a half. Well he ate most of his half, and I ate the rest for him. God it's just so good.Really the only negative thing about our experience was the children next to us, they were sort of awful and loud, but it was 6:30PM on a Saturday in Park Slope, so I guess that's what you get. Anyway it's a veeeery family-friendly spot (do what you will with that observation) but also decent for our little date.Total bill for 2 entrees, a glass of wine, and dessert was about $74.GET THE DESSERT CALZONE",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,13.1000003815,"vodka sauce,food,DESSERT CALZONE,Italian,food,restaurants,focaccia bread,mission,life,city,Christmas Miracle,spot,La Villa,NYE,vodka sauce,bf,reservations,basket,bread basket,bf,dessert calzone,alfredo sauce,rigatoni,regards,tomato sauce,tomato sauce,food,reason,places,way,shrimp,half,half,People,room,oven,bf,rest,thing,dessert,children,most,sugar,linguini,experience,entrees,wine,glass,bill,observation,God,HALF,half,ricotta,ENTREE,ricotta,face,DINNER,Park Slope,Nutella","7,7,7,2,7,2,6,7,7,2,5,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,6,7,7,6,7,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7","0.165613502264,0.0846103727818,0.0715378373861,0.0497755818069,0.039019625634,0.039019625634,0.0350168459117,0.031090863049,0.031090863049,0.031090863049,0.0287334695458,0.0217004101723,0.0183480605483,0.0182814393193,0.0168406963348,0.0148138701916,0.013726959005,0.0134379975498,0.0134070245549,0.0127401230857,0.0124950064346,0.0120955733582,0.0117321358994,0.0117321358994,0.011302465573,0.0112888347358,0.00990319810808,0.00858146790415,0.00790701806545,0.00788188166916,0.0078713670373,0.00722483592108,0.00721988780424,0.00717937527224,0.00717263668776,0.00716636842117,0.00671272212639,0.00670812418684,0.00637064222246,0.00633161468431,0.00627491204068,0.00610144389793,0.00598651356995,0.00580716086552,0.00533480849117,0.00421915808693,0.0036912614014,0.0036912614014,0.0036912614014,0.0036912614014,0.00367716653273,0.003174059093,0.00316932168789,0.00268423464149,0.00268203858286,0.00267803505994,0.00234829960391,0.00234637828544,0.00218623247929,0.00179186440073"

No worries.We live in Astoria so we drove to Park Slope our old neighborhood. So it was an effort. We found a very family oriented restaurant, which I like for a pizzeria. It was fun and entertaining.First time there we ordered a square pizza with 4 or 5 toppings. Delicious but their was more veggie toppings than peperoni and sausage. Still good. Great crust. Perfectly cooked. Not oily for the amount of toppings.Second time my wife and I stopped by we split a Chix Cesar Wrap delicious. Right ratio of grill chicken to romaine lettuce to wrap bread (I think it was homemade) and dressing. Very, very good. Then we split a sausage Calzone. Outstanding. Moist, crispy outside, nice balance of cheese and sausage inside.They miss the fifth star because of no management presence working the floor and front door.

I've eaten here a few times and have gotten take out many, many times. It's a saved spot on my GPS for trusted good food when I'm not up for trying something new.The place looks nice. They have pleanty of space, their booths and seats are comfortable and over all the place has the atmosphere of a good restaurant without being a white-tablecloth high class. I'm surprised people complained about the price. This is clearly not your typical corner pizza joint. I wouldn't expect anything less.Their bread is amazing. The bread on their pizza. The bread on their wraps. The bread that they give with the bread basket (mmm herbs and garlic on top!). It is warm, fresh, soft and thick. They have a brick oven and they clearly know how to use it. Also their portions are huge. Yeah you pay around $15-$20 for a meal. But it's a big meal and you'll probably have leftovers to go. When I got the salad it was a huge plate almost filling over.My favorite by far is their chicken ceaser wrap. This is no ordinary wrap. The wrap itself is thick, unlike how many places have them, warm and has herbs on it. They clearly make their own. It is filled up full so there's no lack of chicken, salad or dressing inside. And again it is big. The wrap is cut in half and each half looks like a seperate wrap of its own. However it does not come with any sides so if you're ordering to go and want fries or a salad you have to order it seperately. Actually not sure if they even have fries. I have never gotten any.

I've been to the restaurant many times, and have ordered take out/delivery as well and La Villa never disappoints! The staff is always friendly and helpful whether over the phone or in person. For starts, the onion bread and garlic bread are the best! Always flavorful and fresh, and basically addicting! My favorite pizza is the prosciutto and rochetta (arugula)! The crust is well cooked and doughy and the prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiano cheese are layered on, and fresh and simply perfect! All the appetizers are delicious and my favorites are the calamari, zucchini discs, and the caprese salad! I also love love love the chicken or veal parm with a side of penne.

About 20 minutes in, the pizza makers sliced several pizzas for us to munch on while waiting for our table. I thought that was such a nice gesture. They certainly didn't have to do that, but it's indicative of the service we received that evening. And the food itself was really good, particularly the vodka pizza.

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,123143,"La Villa is a wonderful place to eat and I have eaten here many times and have never left disappointed. I'm Italian and take Italian food seriously above all other kinds of food and critique it the hardest and La Villa is one of the best. The portions are huge so go hungry. The bread alone is worth the wait. The best dish I have ever gotten is the manicotti which is usually the special. The gnocchi is another special that is awesome. Both dishes are baked in the dish with tons of sauce and cheese. I don't think I have ever had softer gnocchi then La Villa's. The sauce is right up there with the home made stuff from grandma's kitchen. There are tons of pizzas to choose from if you want to go for that. The speciale pizza has a little bit of everything on it- a must try. However, I recently had a stuffed pizza with slices of soft potatoes. It was amazing and seasoned so well. If your waist line can handle appetizers, get a simple potato croquette. They're crunchy on the outside and oh so soft on the inside with cheese oozing out. It's hard to still get it like that around here. There will be a bit of a wait from 6-7 PM. Best to go earlier or around 8:30-9:00. The wait is never more than 20 minutes as the service is quick and they like to turn the tables over fast but you never feel rushed. It's a nice size place although when packed it's hard to navigate around there. It's very noisy especially when the Park Slope residents bring all 10 kids and let them roam around freely. It could get very annoying but it's a necessary evil to get some of the best Italian food in Brooklyn. Very reasonably priced, great to go with a group because you can share the dishes. One thing, I saw someone compared this to the Olive Garden.

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,129336,"What happened to this place? Like many of the recent reviews I was shocked at how bad the service was today. And let me start by saying I have been here at least ten times, including for my son's first birthday a year ago, and the food and service have always been top notch. The hipster host with the flannel literally rolled his eyes at my wife and I as we came in with our son and asked for a highchair. It was 4:30 and there were maybe three other tables there. The food was as always very good. My wife was told they didn't have ketchup for her chicken. A little weird but fine. As we're finishing our dinner the waiter throws the check on the table, says ""thanks guys"" and walks away. My wife always gets the Mississippi Mud Pie for dessert, but for some reason did not have the opportunity.

We also enjoyed some local flavor, as the table behind began to yell and curse about the food, the bill, and how much they seemed to dislike each others company. A real New York experience. Then the waitress started talking to her friend about someone she knew who ""hasn't taken a shit in a week!"" Some people might have been turned off by such a comment, but I tend to think of such gems as ""meal enhancers"".

Fried mozzarella appetizer (cheese string ooey gooey greatness) 3. Caesar salad (big flakes of Parmesan, creamy dressing, crunchy romaine) I'm usually consistent and get a Caesar salad and baked ziti but I've also ventured and try there wood fired pizza and it is very good. NOTE IF YOU ARE TWO PEOPLE YOU CAN EASILY SHARE THE SMALL WOOD FIRED PIZZA YOU DO NOT NEED THE LARGE. Pizza is thin crust good and fresh. Pomodoro rigatoni is eh. I mean for $11 what do you expect it is exactly what it says noodles and sauce nothing special. Eggplant Parmesan is very good but it's a HUGE portion and I'm not a big fan of eggplant so it's ok.  Complimentary bread will have you feeling like a carbohydrate monster because it's so dam good.  Note if you want to try something amazing when they bring you olive oil ask for some balsamic vinegar, drip some balsamic vinegar in with the olive oil ask for some cheese shake some cheese inside and you got yourself some heavenly bread dipping. Deserts are a bit to much for me in the sense that the afogato is fairly simple and the Nutella calzone is big and heavy, I would order it on an empty stomach. GREAT STAFF, GREAT SERVICE, they make me feel like home and I observe there interactions with customers they really treat everyone like family. Cash and credit accepted.

We could finish it all we took pizza home but I sure finished my clams!!! One glass of Sauvignon blanc was more than enough!

I hate to have to give them only three stars, but I dont understand how they could possibly hire him as a waiter. Service is a major part of the restaurant industry and he obviously doesn't pass the test. I have no idea what his name was because he didn't say and I didn't care to ask. He was a complete turnoff.

Last night my husband wanted good Pizza and so I told him I have this place in Park Slope that's the real deal. Of course husbands never believe their wives when it means travelling 20 minutes to pizza, so for the duration of the car ride him and my friends in the back seat made sure to threaten that if this is not the best pizza they've had, they would never forgive me.We walk in to La Villa and get greeted by a friendly staff telling us the Maitre De will be with us in just a moment. While we're waiting, Jose at the bar asks if we'd like to sit in the VIP section where he can serve us. Of course we love good service so we took our seats at the bar. Jose is THAT employee that all businesses wish for. We came in wanting just pizza and somehow he managed to, very charmingly, get us to order a million other things. Don't mistaken this for a complaint,  this was the perfect night with the real deal Italian pizza. We ordered the Focaccia della Nonna pizza, Eggplant Parmesan, Salad, Wine, Beer, Desserts.Everything we ordered was per Jose's recommendation. I cannot begin to tell you how on point he was with deciding what each of us would enjoy. Especially with my wine. He picked the perfect red for me. If you need a solid eggplant parmesan that tastes a tiny bit like chicken, (It's that good) this is the place to get it at. We ravaged that plate as if it was the last eggplant on earth. The pizza, as per the boys, was seemingly incredible. They couldn't stop thanking me and praising me for getting them seriously good Pizza. From start to finish, this was a meal fit for the best.

Good to see they're still standing. We came here right after Hubby's karate class a few blocks down. This is a family restaurant so you see many families eating here. The wait was 5-10 mins when we got there at dinner time on Friday but could be different for other days. You have to walk in a few steps forward to see the host, she's not right by the door. So the pizza maker would signal you to walk in just in case you're not sure what to do. I think the guy's name is Steve? Friendly and helpful. The pizza making section is on the left of the door and dining is on the right side. We were seated by the window, hooray! We ordered from the specials, the spicy shrimp and mussels with linguini in red sauce, for me. Hubby had shrimp and broccoli rabe with fusilli in garlic oil. Both dishes were excellent but the fusilli was probably better than my fish. However, we shared both dishes. The shrimp was better than most restaurants, big and fresh! My dish wasn't spicy although the menu said so. I wouldn't recommend my dish much but not because it wasn't spicy enough but the sauce was very good but not great. I would recommend the fusilli the way they prepared for us that day. Not sure whether that's from the specials or regular menu. Nice selection of wine they have here and a bit pricier than most great Italian restaurants we have been to although I saw some of the same brands. We had a very good waiter, Christopher.

La Villa,5356,261 5th Ave,Brooklyn,11215.0,177434,"I felt compelled to write this review because I'm mad at myself for not expresing my dissatisfaction at the restaurant. I've been ordering from LA Villa for years I usually dine in at Howard beach and do take out from park slope when leaving the gym or babysitting in the area. Tonight I wanted to do something different and after leaving a class at gym that almost killed me I decided to dine in. Asked the guys at cash register if I could order there and sit on the side, they suggested using the bar with JOSE.   Really didn't want to go in with post workout clothes but I said what the heck I'll sit at the bar. JOSE then places paper padding at my seat and converses casually with patrons next to me for about ten minutes. Maybe if I didn't know the menu like the back of my hand, or know what I was gonna order, or wasn't dead tired and hungry or with someone else this wouldn't have bothered me so much. However this  wasn't the case so this annoyed me. Finally Jose takes my order(I usually get the penne alla vodka with breaded on the side) today I wanted to be different so I ordered the rigatoni alla vodka with breaded chicken on the side . This guy then tells me the grilled chicken is really great. Now I'm wondering if he's really serious  . I repeat I WANT BREADED CHICKEN!!!!. He placed a plate with a mozzarella stick and rice ball in my setting not directly in front me had no clue it was for me since I didn't order it until he told me to be careful with plate it was hot (another strike) Then came the final nail in this LA Villa Park slope coffin. My order comes out one plate rigatoni alla vodka now I'm super pissed. I searched plate and see this guy gives me my breaded chicken mixed in. For some this may not seem like a big deal but I hate soggy meat, when I mom cooks at home she knows to put my protein on the side. At Thai restaurant I order a vegetable rice,noodle or vegetables with a protein entree on the side. AT LA VILLA I always request my breaded chicken on the side. SO NOW I'M HUNGRY TIRED AND STEAMING MAD!!!! I chose not to say anything because I don't want to look like the aggressive black chick in the restaurant. I ate the dinner and was continually annoyed by Jose who decided to be patronizing (because my dissatisfaction was obviously apparent) by calling me honey and buddy throughout my dinner. I won't be dinning in there ever again and I'm seriously contemplating spending my money at this branch again.

La Villa Pizzeria,5358,8207 153rd Ave,Howard Beach,11414.0,2402,"La Villa is an excellent, but overpriced pizzeria/restaurant. I've been going to La Villa for years and I always enjoy everything I get. On the weekends it gets packed so I suggest going early. They have outdoor seating and a large indoor seating area; on weekdays you can walk in and seat yourself. When dining in you'll get a bread basket for the table that is loaded with focaccia bread and onion bread; you must try the onion bread it is heavenly! There is olive oil, salt, and pepper on the table so you can dip the bread until your heart is content, but don't fill up on it because their dishes are large. Any of their apps are good, the calamari and mozzarella and carozza the gotos. My fav entrees are the La Villa house salad, the chicken caesar wrap, the la villa wrap, the arugula wrap, and rigatoni alla vodka. The La Villa House Salad has assorted mixed greens with local homemade mozzarella, mild provolone, sweet homemade oven roasted peppers over garlic bruschetta, I get it with the lemon olive oil dressing. Its a large and excellent salad but when you add chicken it comes to $20, which is a lot for just a salad. The wraps are gigantic and wood-fired, giving it that nice smokey flavor. The wrap can come on whole wheat, just ask. The caesar wrap is one of my all time favorites because the dressing is so rich and creamy, by far my fav caesar dressing out there! The rigatoni alla vodka ($17) is in a light red cream sauce with sautéed prosciutto di Parma and vodka; the prosciutto gives the dish that added texture and let's be honest anything with prosciutto is THAT much better. For dessert I suggest getting the Nutella and ricotta calzone, it is such an unusual pairing, but it couldn't work any better.

The slice is floppy and damp almost like it was sitting in water for 15 minutes before they served it but the bottom is black and tastes like soot from their wood fired oven. With all those illegals working in the place you would think they would tell one of them to climb inside the oven and clean it out once in a while. I also tried a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken reminded me of something you would get from a frozen TV dinner. It was rubbery with the edges being rock hard. The bread was uninspired and looked like they bought it at 5pm and the stop and shop next door. The roasted red peppers lacked any and all flavor and just tasted ""wet"".Honestly my fellow yelpers between me and you I would take a pass on this  place. #1 it's in Lindenwood not Howard Beach (yes I know some consider it to be Howard Beach but it's not) and unless you live in Lindenwood you really have no reason to be there. Lindenwood along with Hamilton Beach is Queens answer to West Bumblef**k.#2 The pizza just isn't any good you have about 4 pizza places close by in Ozone Park or Howard Beach that have far superior slices.#3 the price is a little higher than most pizza joints.

The calamari was hot and freshly fried. Standard sauce. Overall good, but nothing special. It came with only rings. I prefer when they come with the crispy legs. My chicken parm was better then expected. 3 flavorful pieces of chicken that were moist and not dried.

Everyone on the Pizzeria side is very friendly & they always say goodbye when you're leaving. Kudos to them! Today me and a friend decided to have dinner there & they sat us in the dining area. We should have sat outside, at least last time I went there, the service outside was awesome! The waitress was friendly and always made sure we had extra napkins & our drinks never went empty. Today was a different story! We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, that we shared & they served us water. But for the 2 hours we were there, that was all we had to drink!! Our water was never refilled or were we asked if we needed any additional drinks. Or given any additional napkins. What they did do, more than twice during our dinner, was ask if we were done or if we wanted our food wrapped. I get it, restaurants are all about turn over, but don't rush your guests out the door, especially if it's not busy and there are a lot of tables available!! We would have ordered more drinks, but the service was so terrible, we decided to just leave. Even when we asked for the check, it took forever to get back to us.

I have also never strayed from ordering the same exact items every single visit for those ten plus years! Yes, I am a creature of habit...and, well, if ain't broke don't fix it.1./ Bread basket is delicious - when it is fresh - especially their special ""onion"" focaccia/bread.2./ We always start with their Roman slice, which is stuffed with potatoes, sausage, pepperoni, and mozzarella. It is amazing (I will post a pic). We also always start with the La Villa house salad which is very good and can most certainly serve two people plus (have them dress the salad for you) (stop skimping on the roasted peppers, veggies, and ciligini (sp.). 3./ Main course: my husband and I share a baked ziti (well done). My absolute favorite. I LOVE LA VILLA BAKED ZITI!!!4./ All of their restaurants are very clean and I have never had any issues with the service. 5./ The restaurant food quality is pretty much the same between the Howard Beach location, Mill Basin location and Park Slope location.  Park Slope being my least favorite to eat at and I swear the portions are much smaller than the other two locations. 6./ La Villa is NOT Italian fine dining if that is what you are expecting. And it is sometimes hit or miss with some of the food options according to people I have eaten there with (remember, I order the same exact things every time). 7./ As someone who has been eating here for over a decade their prices have gone up tremendously and food portions have shrunk tremendously. I understand that prices have gone up, etc., but it is something I definitely notice over the past few years. Even tonight when we ate here the price of the La Villa house salad went up since the last time we were there, which was definitely within the past couple of months. 8./ Expect long waits on the weekends especially in Park Slope and Mill Basin. We go early as to not have to wait and be rushed out.

La Villa Pizzeria,5358,8207 153rd Ave,Howard Beach,11414.0,53429,Why would someone pay for over priced mediocre food. Sure take out. They charge you a delivery charge and pocket the $$. Try swapping a salad instead of pasta and they'll charge you again. Or yeah you want extra dressing for the Caesar wrap they charge you. It amazes me that HB people give them money for bad food. I prefer giving my business to a real restaurant and not a pizzeria acting like a ristorante. So.... the wife asked if la villa Ristorante was ok for dinner. I figured ok I know they suck but she wanted the chicken Caesar wrap and fried zucchini. How could they possibly fuck this up I said. Hey guess what? THEY DID !! No wrap instead they gave us mushy chicken on stale salad. Not over. As for fried zucchini. It was so soaked with grease that Danny from Grease could have used it in his hair. Oh yeah.

But whatevs.  I still like their house salad (also huge) to share as a starter.I have also had out of this world chicken parm here.  They include pasta with it, as any self-respecting Italian restaurant should (no potato croquette or side of mixed vegetables for this lady).And the pizza is also very good.  But I hardly ever have pizza when I come here, because the rest of the food is better.The smells, oh the smells.  And the bread, I nearly forgot.  Oniony, garlicky focaccia.  And they keep it coming.I even like the way their Diet Coke tastes.  They put lemon in it without my having to ask.The ONE caveat: when it's crowded (like EVERY Friday & Saturday night), expect to waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.  And wait and wait.  I once had to go across the street to the bodega to get a banana to stuff in my gullet just to hold me over.",5.0 star rating,"Detroit, MI",3,1,0.20000000298,10.5,"food,locations,Pizza,pasta,place,Series,restaurant,part,NY,Holy Moly.,Manhattan,category.,Baked Ziti,La Villa,tastes,U,place,reason,reason,Ave,appeal,good,ices,Baked Ziti,ziti,one,Salads,variation,U location,salad,chicken,mom,earth,ends,meal,family,high school,Park Slope,Brooklyn,rest,pizza,Mom,smells,smells,food,BZ Bolognese,bread,focaccia,Oniony,way,banana,Dolly,Kings Plaza,waiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit,caveat,lemon,street,bodega,gullet,restaurant,Diet Coke,house salad,pizza,potato croquette,pasta,world,chicken parm,starter.,lady,vegetables,side,Italian","7,2,6,7,7,6,2,7,2,1,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,6,1,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,2","0.1517342031,0.0682672634721,0.0660573393106,0.0658789351583,0.0601557046175,0.0527115426958,0.0391538105905,0.0343867763877,0.0313403978944,0.0313403978944,0.0291295107454,0.0251842066646,0.019168894738,0.0149363381788,0.0109676513821,0.0109532568604,0.010913441889,0.0108826588839,0.0108575718477,0.0103522883728,0.00952293816954,0.00950097944587,0.00823543313891,0.00798241049051,0.00796795450151,0.00777327409014,0.00746709201485,0.00745962420478,0.00731796538457,0.00727500813082,0.00661725318059,0.00661725318059,0.00641551800072,0.00641551800072,0.00633627828211,0.00633627828211,0.00578978471458,0.00567653635517,0.00565587868914,0.00541893253103,0.00541893253103,0.00524067226797,0.00492880772799,0.00492880772799,0.00492880772799,0.00466166855767,0.00430994713679,0.00430771708488,0.00430771708488,0.00430557597429,0.00383599312045,0.00378465885296,0.0037790115457,0.00297946855426,0.00297946855426,0.00297946855426,0.0029767700471,0.0029767700471,0.0029767700471,0.00291321473196,0.0025487516541,0.00244075222872,0.00237821880728,0.00231801276095,0.00216298503801,0.00189339346252,0.00189339346252,0.00189339346252,0.00189227657393,0.00189227657393,0.00189227657393,0.00111991807353"

Its the Italian restaurant where Scar Face would eat had he not been filled with holes in his final moments of coke snorting (a lovely sport i hear).When ever I go out to eat I always call ahead. Often times I find places that aren't seating in the wee hours of 8 to 9 pm. In this situation I called at 8:45 to find they were no longer seating guests at 9:30pm. Even though I live five minutes away, I knew they wouldn't take a handsome fella like me to join them in a sit down meal. As I try to enter La Villa I noticed there is a test you have to pass in order to enter the premises. A simple feet of strength! A gent attempting to enter La Villa had a bit of trouble passing the test of opening the front door. Being the nice guy that I am. I nearly tore the door off the hinges so the little guy could get in. Typically i prefer to sit in and enjoy the atmosphere and ambiance of the modern Italian. The ever so loud ""EY"" and ""ILL TAKE A STELTZA!!"" rings throughout the parlor. I learned that ""steltza"" is just carbonated water, sometimes enjoyed with a lemon.I ordered the Lasagna and petrified bread apparently. I noticed that New York folks love their bread. Every meal comes with it. Bagels here in New York are the size of car tires. Something about a sweet roll or butter roll is a craze too. When I arrived home I found my lasagna in an aluminum container stuffed in a pizza box still boiling. I do enjoy hot food but my mouth is not made of metal. I've witnessed people diving into ""fresh out of the oven"" pizza without even blowing on it! When i try eating pizza without letting it cool, i end up with a mouth full of 2nd degree burns!Now, appearances can be deceiving from what I hear and came to learn. My meal that looked like blended up pizza looked hot but the center was far from that. Chefs who are eager to close the kitchen and go home, often times rush the food and don't allow the food to cook all the way through. I get it. I work 12 - 14 hour days and rush home to nobody and to do nothing as well. 4 out of 5I did enjoy my lasagna just the temperature was a little turn off.

La Villa Pizzeria & Restaurant,5359,6610 Ave U,Brooklyn,11234.0,38438,"Had dinner there last night and thanks to the Manager and Waiter Jake the evening was saved. I'm giving 3 stars because of some crucial components that really need fixing although the meal itself was really delicious. The food isn't always what keeps you coming back. We called ahead for reservations for 2 and it's fair that we couldn't make any. We were told about 10 minute wait time and were 10 minutes away. When I came up to the girl at the hostess stand to introduce myself as the girl who called in she was very nasty in saying we don't take reservations. I explained yes I know I'm just introducing myself, she replied,"" well I don't answer the phone I don't know who you are"". Okay fine! 2 please .. Left my name asked wait time said thank you and stepped aside. Thank god we were able to order some wine while we waited and the guys behind the counter were so pleasant and nice that I forgot about the bad taste in my mouth this girl Bridgette gave me. A little while later my friend walks up to check on the wait because we lost track of time and the wait area seemed to clear up. Bridgette was so nasty and dismissive and told her she keeps coming up every 5 minutes, my friend explains it's just hot by the counter to which Bridgette replied, "" so then take off your coat."" So un necessary. My friend asked  to speak to the manager and we never got his name but he immediately addressed her and had us seated. We were okay with waiting it's a part of going out to eat but where in this girls mind does she feel she has the right to talk to patrons this way. Then as she seated us she implied my friend was a princess with an obnoxious waving hand gesture as if she was saying here sit at your thrown. Just disgusting, again we found ourselves just ready to leave. Luckily Jake the waiter showed up with a smile and was so welcoming so he lightened the mood up. He was so pleasant and professional, his service was truly appreciated. Things like that are what make your dinner experience. I don't care how good your rigatoni vokda is, I can easily go get it elsewhere, it's the service that makes someone want to come back. Bridgette single handedly made us want to walk out and leave twice. The dinner was very delicious and as always served at perfect temperature. Very generous with condiments at no extra charge which is great considering the price point of the menu. I will come back, as I have been for years, but if I see Bridgette I don't even want to communicate with her, the impression she left on us is unrepairable. She needs a desk job where doesn't have to interact with people coming out for a nice dinner.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,13.1999998093,"Bridgette,friend,dinner,girl,components,Manager,thanks,part,service,food,meal,reservations,stars,hostess,Waiter Jake,any,counter,manager,waiter,girl,reservations,wait,phone,charge,coat,counter,dinner,wait area,desk job,mouth,taste,wine,track,god,name,way,patrons,right,girls mind,princess,name,rigatoni,temperature,condiments,someone,dinner,impression,dinner experience,price point,menu,people,guys,hand gesture,mood,smile,Things,service","1,1,4,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7","0.084777250886,0.0746651142836,0.0717836618423,0.0678090974689,0.0643667131662,0.0607836134732,0.0532527528703,0.0430244728923,0.0385538339615,0.0309568084776,0.0303404517472,0.0287925135344,0.0254269000143,0.0243912357837,0.0211373753846,0.0195776373148,0.0186520535499,0.0170412249863,0.0143839139491,0.0129651008174,0.012756511569,0.00969643518329,0.00957042351365,0.0093941707164,0.00746441166848,0.00734331831336,0.00702488422394,0.00675167609006,0.00649935146794,0.00642504217103,0.00642504217103,0.00642504217103,0.0064179613255,0.00634413119406,0.00585263548419,0.00585173815489,0.00585173815489,0.00585173815489,0.00585173815489,0.00520399166271,0.0049380492419,0.00435422221199,0.00434942170978,0.00434717116877,0.00429936731234,0.00406705914065,0.00368474470451,0.00338092097081,0.00300960242748,0.00300960242748,0.0030066666659,0.00278277089819,0.00191575812642,0.00191305729095,0.00191305729095,0.00179321726318,0.00155160331633"

Everything was amazing just as it was two years ago and I got excited because I got my favorite takeout place back.  WRONG!Last night my very blonde sister ordered the arugula wrap and found a black hair in it.  That was the last straw with this place- the food is always tasty but I can't bring myself to eat in a place that is dirty.  They should either get a better cleaning staff or invest in hair nets.  If you don't mind the occasional hair in your food- I'd go here.  But it is off my list.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.10000000149,9.69999980927,"eater,place,manager,favorites,experiences,star,family,fire,group,straw,LaVilla,place,something,all,menu,restaurant,bunch,ziti,Everything,roach,t hat,all,friends,stuff,sauce,house,delivery guy,order,person,food,place,hair,arugula wrap,sister,shot,cleaning staff,hair,Mill Basin Plaza,food,hair nets,list,wraps,bugs,appetizers,couple,pizza,takeout place","1,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,3,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7","0.780153930187,0.0259259622544,0.025513375178,0.0253809783608,0.0192725285888,0.0137469097972,0.00923051219434,0.00665948679671,0.00600399821997,0.00588716287166,0.00547947129235,0.00464739790186,0.00434584915638,0.00412264326587,0.00353598012589,0.00350510817952,0.00349522684701,0.00349522684701,0.00254231574945,0.00250930688344,0.00249645696022,0.00244457367808,0.00236080074683,0.00236080074683,0.00235535623506,0.00234679109417,0.00234679109417,0.00234329327941,0.00234329327941,0.00222842558287,0.00215300335549,0.00200220453553,0.00182119302917,0.00159347325098,0.00151935056783,0.00141930638347,0.00138310168404,0.00126821640879,0.00125800131354,0.00110148300882,0.00109983957373,0.000800536945462,0.000701136363205,0.000700363132637,0.000700363132637,0.000700363132637,0.00069808884291"
