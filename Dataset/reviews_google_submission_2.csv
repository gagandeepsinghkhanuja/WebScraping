La Villa Pizzeria & Restaurant,5359,6610 Ave U,Brooklyn,11234.0,35227,Overpriced and pretentious at best- better off heating up frozen pizza from key food next door. Pasta dishes are nothing to rave about either. Staff is generally discourteous and unprofessional. Local 99 cents pizza slices deliver a better bang for your buck than Lavilla mill basinOn the latest visit- ordered grandma pie- the bottom of the slice was soggy- the top was virtually burnt- felt greasy overall- the sauce was mediocre at best- definitely not with spending $30. Biggest disappointment was the linguine with white clam sauce- the linguine was over cooked - the sauce lacked any flavor whatsoever and the portion was tiny.

La Villa Pizzeria & Restaurant,5359,6610 Ave U,Brooklyn,11234.0,79846,"Two middle fingers up to La Villa! (Even my middle toes).So I was always a proud customer of La Villa, my family are big fans of the grandma pies. But nowadays, I rather order DiGiorno. I decided to order pick up a grandma pie and a regular pie, the bill came out to be 50 dollars. FIFTY DOLLARS. FIFTY.  Do you know how much I could have bought for 50 dollars? I asked the cashier to recheck my order and he started to give me an attitude, Mr.Cashier/Waiter why give me an attitude while you work for tips? He told me then, ""What do you expect"" I looked him in the eyes and told him, ""I expect not to get ripped off"" and walked away. It just baffles me a place like La Villa who has HORRIBLE reviews and is right next to D'Amore which is amazing, and their customers agree; will over price their food.

La Villa Pizzeria & Restaurant,5359,6610 Ave U,Brooklyn,11234.0,6014,"The boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Friday night for dinner. I wanted to go out to eat, he suggested Italian food and we somehow ended up at La Villa. The place was packed with couples and families. I thought we would have to wait awhile for a table. Butttttttt, we got lucky and were seated right away. Between the two of us, we split the baked clams (half a dozen), mozzarella balls and the rigatoni alfredo with chicken (it was supposed to be with the vodka sauce, but they ran out so it was substituted with alfredo sauce). The baked clams were quite good. I really enjoyed them. Be careful not to burn yourself though; they come out piping hot from the oven straight to your table. The clams go nicely with the garlic sauce on the platter so be sure to spoon some onto the clams before you eat them! I thought the mozzarella balls were okay. I like it when the cheese is piping hot and all melty on the inside and these weren't like that at all. The dipping sauce was ehh. To be honest, it wasn't that memorable. My favorite of the three dishes we ordered was the rigatoni alfredo with chicken. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the alfredo sauce was creamy and mm'mm good. The chicken was super tender and flavorful. Everything went together really well. It sucks that they didn't have the vodka sauce because I would have loved to try it, but the alfredo sauce was so good that it made me forget about the vodka sauce.

The service is great and the wait staff is very friendly. The food however, is just not appetizing. I leave this place paying $30 for what tasted like a $10 meal. There have been a few occasions where the pasta sauce has this orange hue to it. It reminds me of chef boyardee sauce and it tastes like it. The onion bread , which used to be so good my friends and I could fill up on that alone, is not as fresh as it used to be. It comes out burnt and they only give like 2 pieces now and if you ask for more, the waiter cringes a little. I love to eat pizza but the pizza here just turns me off. I got a vegetable slice and felt like I was eating a giant veggie salad on bread. Too much veggies not enough sauce or cheese to enjoy.The only dish I enjoy here is the baked ziti. The cheese is melted very nice and they give a nice portion that it fills you up.

We ordered whole what pasta, and got regular, only to be told that it was in fact whole wheat. When we complained to the manager, the waiter told us that the sous chef told him it was whole wheat. We ordered our usual salad, but asked to substitute roasted peppers instead of the cheese...which is what we always do...and he up charged us because according to him ""there are no substitutes.

It literally to 7 minuets for her to take my order. Ill even get past the fact that I had to repeat myself 3 times but to tell me my total she had to call me back 10 after my order was placed.  It took 35 minutes to receive my order. I was excited to dig into my burrito. Smh it's was sloppy the sour cream was very milky the guacamole was mushy like gravy n my food had no taste.

This is a small storefront restaurant, one you could easily imagine having been a luncheonette in a past life. The wall jukebox literally blares Mexican music, and starts and stops on it own whim. Sorta like a comedy routine when you're having a conversation. The wall paintings do add a friendly look to the place. But I came for some good Mexican food, and that's what I got. Started with a quick $2 chicken taco as a baseline. Lots of chicken, two soft taco shells (too much filling for just one,)  grilled chicken chunks that were tasty and not dried out, lots of guacamole (a little on the bland side, but still good.) The chicken enchiladas plate was really yummified. Fully stuffed, nice portion, tasty sweet ( I asked for not hot) red sauce,  really good refried beans, and decent rice. I'll definitely go back and try some of the other dishes. Oh, and the waitress was attentive (and cute.) As far as this place being authentic, seemed to me everyone else eating there was also Mexican. (Racial profiling, anyone?)

The guacamole also had no flavor, and I had to add salt and lime to the guacamole. The salsa was so spicy that I could only eat it with sour cream. And I like spicy food!

Definitely a must-get for the connoisseur of Mexican cuisine.Then you may be asking. ""Hey guy, why the 3 stars then?"" Well, that's because I came here once with a group and they all wanted to try the ""barbacoa"", or goat dish. I think that they literally served us up a plate of stale meat. It was disgusting, and my friend paid twice as much for it as most of their menu items. Horribly disappointed by that experience and I don't think I can easily get over it.

We shared a number of items, I wasn't able to include photos of all dishes because the group I went with indulged before I finished photo taking!  I was able to taste some baked clams, rice ball (Arancini), sautéed Broccoli Rapa pizza, and Piadina. The baked clams were tender and the bread crumbs were very flavorful. The Arancini was very good. The textures were excellent and the frying was done to perfection. The sautéed Broccoli Rapa pizza was excellent! The crust is very good, I would prefer less charring. The chew was good. The broccoli rabe was fantastic.  I added a small amount of the olive oil on the table which elevated it further! They sell the olive oil, we got some to take home it is excellent. The Piadina, which means flat bread sandwich, was very good.  You get a choice of the meat you want.  I choose hot soppressata but they were out, instead I then choose speck  (smoked prosciutto). I enjoyed the flavors but I think I would just do pizza in future. Next time I'll try a pasta dish.I want to return to reevaluate service.

She was sweet, attentive and fabulous. She deserves five stars. She had a pony tail, blonde hair, sweet beautiful smile and maybe about 5'7? She knew I liked the onion bread so she offered to give us more especially since they were fresh!I've been to the Howard beach location many times and I think the food here was pretty good. We ordered the calamari with the red peppers. I'd order the sauce on the side next time instead of mixed in. We also had a whole pie and the penne alla vodka. The penne was delicioussss but just a tad too salty for my tasting. That onion bread with that sauce though... YUM. Now let's talk about the decor. Absolutely stunning. Love the marble and the lightning. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the service and the food. My sister went a couple of days after opening and she had a totally different experience.

Labadee Manoir,5362,20713 Jamaica Ave,Queens Village,11428.0,193679,"Came here before to take part in a dance performance and for a family reunion. Those experiences were fine. They always provide great Haitian food.But, this review is for my visit to Labadee this past weekend. I came here for my cousin's baby shower. While the Haitian food was excellent, there were some issues. The restaurant understaffed the party: there was only one bartender, who was also a server, and another man who I will call the manager (not sure if that was his role). These two men served the needs of about 30 adults and kids. My low score is due to the manager's unprofessional behavior. The bartender was not behind the bar and I waited about 10 minutes. When the manager if the bartender would be coming back, he rudely said ""no bartender"" and walked away. At that point, I walked away from the bar. This establishment was not going to receive my money after that. At the end of the night, people told me that the manager was rude to them at some point as well.At 9pm, which I guess was the time my cousin agreed to end the party, the manager immediately started cleaning up tables and rearranging the space. He moved people's bags sans their permission. He also popped all the balloons with a pen. All the while, he huffed and puffed. When I asked the manager for an aluminum container in which to place the untouched cake he said ""No, she does not get that."" Mind you, there were 4 containers already there containing the leftover food. Really? You're going to nickel and dime during a baby shower. All of our party was highly perturbed. So was my cousin, who was upset that her shower ended in such a manner. Luckily, someone went to the bartender and asked for aluminum foil, which we got. While I understand Labadee is running a business, there are certain things you do and don't do. You do execute a written contract (disclaimer: based on the manager's behavior at 9pm, I am going to assume there wasn't one) so you could state, for example, what happens if the party does not end on time .

Let me start by saying that you should call your order in before you get there. Oh wait, the phones are rarely working so you're forced to go there and deal with the VERY RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL staff. Once you arrive you still can't place your order right away because there's never anyone at the counter/bar. They're usually out-of-sight downstairs hanging out. So now, you've got to scream down there to let them know that you're upstairs. That'll take them another 10 mins.Finally, you'll be able to actually place your order with one of the inattentive and rude wait staff. After taking your order they will descend back into the crypt from whence they emerged, never to be seen again. But wait. ""Didn't I place an order?"" Is what you will be wondering to yourself as time elapse and you start to becoming faint from hunger. You'll have to go back to the crypt entrance and scream to remind them that you're still waiting.

The ambiance was so-so, and we decided to order our food ""to go"" as well. The gentleman who took our order wrote nothing down, and it took at least 4 or 5  times for him to get it right. We sat at a table and noticed the table cloth had food stains that were clearly visible.

The grilled chicken was moist with a lot of good flavors. The side of rice could feed a small family! The mofongo with fried pork was very good. The gravy really added flavor. Did i mention this food is very affordable?  The tres leches cake is also AMAZING. TRY IT. Bottom line: try this place. You won't be sorry.

LaGuardia Cafe,5363,97-02 23rd Ave,East Elmhurst,11369.0,193749,"Visited the La Guardia Cafe today, mostly because it was only an 8 minute walk from the hotel. It's definitely a ""hole in the wall"" style establishment, but there is a very welcoming feel. When we walked in I was a little confused. I was handed menus by a wonderful, friendly server. But then after showing us where to sit, she didn't come back. She also didn't speak much English, so my poor, broken Spanish had to step up to the plate. Fortunately I've spent some time studying very important Spanish phrases like, ""yo quireo pollo, por favor."" In the end, I ordered chicken tenders for the kids, a chicken quesidilla, a grilled chicken salad for my wife, and the chicken cordon Bleu, which my wife warned me was a mistake. No margaritas, so we settled for water and diet Cokes. There were additional complications. All I could decipher was that our meal would take 30 minutes to prepare. We were in no rush, so we decided to go with the flow. While waiting, I realized that the reason the place is so popular is that they have a sort of lunch service, with pre-made dishes: roast plantain, rice, steak, roast chicken,  and a number of other scrumptious looking items, cooked in bulk and waiting at the counter. People kept coming in, ordering a lunch, and would get it seconds later. Sweet deal. Wish I'd known!Finally our food arrived. Chicken tenders were actually massive chicken planks, pre-breaded and tossed in the frier with fries. My chicken loving daughter wasn't terribly impressed. And there was more food than she could eat. My wife's grilled chicken was tasty, but she said the salad it came on was lifeless and bland. The chicken cordon blue was the real mystery.  It was slabs of tasteless chicken, carved like pork chops, covered in a garlic cream sauce so heavily GARLIC that it was practically inedible. Overly salty too. I think I saw some ham. If the French saw this interpretation I'm afraid they'd grow a spine and wage war.So why the three star rating when we didn't care for the food? Ah... you forgot the chicken quesidilla.  Oh my God. It was AMAZING. Thick chunks of perfectly grilled chicken, queso blanco, and sautéed onions. It was served with a sweet sirracha sauce and made it ALL worth while.The lunch specials may be great, but my money is on those quesidillas.

I came across this place mainly because I decided to try something in Brooklyn as opposed to the places near Lexington in Manhattan, and I was blown away!We ordered roghni naans, beef nehari, butter chicken, aaloo keema, kashmiri chai, and samosas for a grand total of $24. The servings were generous and the food was delicious! The ambience left a little something to be desired, but hey, you pay primarily for the food and cleanliness at a restaurant, not the furniture. Also I guess I didn't mind GEO news playing in the background because it reminded me of Lahore. And they have a great selection of food. They may be missing one or two dishes any given day, but there were at least 12 entrees hot and ready to go (plus samosas, barbecued stuff, chaat, pakoras, traditional sweets like chum chum, as well as gajrelay and kheer, which was delicious). They're also rated A for cleanliness. The woman who served us, Mehwish, was also really attentive and courteous.

Lahori Chilli,5365,1026 Coney Island Ave,Brooklyn,11230.0,193845,"FYI to the guy who commented that the Kashmiri chai was a ""lurid pink and fatty"" - um, that's how it supposed to be buddy.  Pink and rich.  It's made for very cold Kashmiri winters, not to soothe your hipster precious sensibilities about tea.  And if you come to a Pakistani restaurant and expect to find non-greasy food, you're already perhaps too clueless to be giving any Yelp reviews so I'll refrain.  It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and complaining about the cilantro and chopped onions everywhere. With that being said to put ignorance in it's place, I'll begin. Pretty good service, and delicious food.  I tried the palak (spinach) and it was sooooo good.  What really ""made it"" was the amazing garlic tempering that was put on it, it really brings out the flavor of the spinach so well.  Reminded me of home cooking so much. I also tried the lamb curry, and it was very good, not out of this world though.  Nice chunks of tender, fatty lamb cooked in a spiced tomato sauce.  I didn't try the nihari (beef stew), but it looked incredibly decadent and delicious.  Pretty big variety for a traditional Pakistani place, I saw almost 12 different dishes out on the table! They were generous with the portions for the price you pay.  One person can eat like a king here for under 10 bucks.Everyone else in the restaurant was having naan, and it looked great, but didn't try it personally yet so cannot speak to that.Next time I'll try naan, nihari, and possibly the interesting looking desserts they had out.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,9.80000019073,"guy,buddy,chai,fatty,ignorance,Kashmiri,garlic tempering,Pink,naan,palak,food,lamb curry,restaurant,Pakistani,tea,winters,sensibilities,reviews,nihari,restaurant,food,spinach,spinach,onions,everywhere,cilantro,being,service,home cooking,world,chunks,tender,naan,Yelp,restaurant,flavor,dishes,table,portions,price,person,king,Everyone,Mexican,nihari,desserts,fatty lamb,place,tomato sauce,beef stew,variety","1,1,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,5,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,2,7,6,1,7,7,7,7","0.322443932295,0.0673564895988,0.0657066702843,0.0629468932748,0.0500884503126,0.0423170216382,0.0396191701293,0.0302332080901,0.0250889994204,0.0196800585836,0.0181156881154,0.017945529893,0.0126388343051,0.010410938412,0.0101008545607,0.0101008545607,0.0101008545607,0.0100641762838,0.00923118647188,0.00851648394018,0.0077144857496,0.00770146027207,0.00703797675669,0.00677962927148,0.00677962927148,0.00677962927148,0.00676399935037,0.00675081228837,0.00615042075515,0.00614300277084,0.00613623857498,0.00613623857498,0.00600209319964,0.00596373528242,0.00574040459469,0.00529035460204,0.00457654986531,0.00457654986531,0.00457255123183,0.00457255123183,0.00456881383434,0.00456881383434,0.00456881383434,0.00401555886492,0.00361600168981,0.00316374306567,0.00229944544844,0.00229495577514,0.00201173662208,0.00200969586149,0.00200780830346"

Prices are decent and you can pay with card when you order so that's always a plus for me. Delivery usually takes about 45 mins to an hour and I'm about a mile from here. Have yet to go in person to check out the sweets options but I ordered one traditional Indian sweet once and honestly don't remember what it was but it was also tasty. Only downside is occasionally one delivery guy calls when he arrives and makes me come downstairs to pick up my delivery order outside.,4.0 star rating,"Nashville, TN",1,1,0.600000023842,5.5,"place,food,husband,sweet,card,staff,all,Delivery,phone,things,delivery guy,plus,menu,Prices,downside,delivery order,person,sweets options,Indian","7,7,1,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2","0.218607500196,0.124420747161,0.102583035827,0.0863019824028,0.0779130980372,0.0482422672212,0.0477927438915,0.0454933792353,0.039454434067,0.0378556661308,0.0347115397453,0.0308600440621,0.0266013089567,0.0249046869576,0.0220984257758,0.0125109031796,0.00794457551092,0.00699927052483,0.00470441253856"

Now you have to understand that our neighborhood (Parkville/Little Pakistan) has more small grocery stores, Pakistani restaurants and clothing stores per block than grains of sand on the beach at Coney Island!  But I say ""what the heck"" and give it a try.  Well thank you Ibrahim M because this place really is the best and here are the reasons why!It is very clean. It Is friendly.  It is very reasonably priced but most important, the food is delicious! Their chicken kebabs ($1 each) are fresh, spicy and flavorful. Their ""Keema Karilla"" (ground chicken with bitter melon) contains big pieces of bitter melon as well as other ingredients and is far less oily than at many of their competitors.

He degraded her and talked about her appearance and when I tried to defend her he said get the F**K out the door. I told my friend upon exit what proceeded to take place while I waited for her. She then went to complain and his exact words were"" If you two B**tches do not leave I will mase you.""I do not know how this escalated and if it is even legal for a restaurant to have these kind of people working and representing their place of business.

The Bad-My mom comes to buy dimsum here often.  And she has been telling me about this lady that has a stink attitude, rude, impolite, YOU NAME IT! I didnt really believe her because, for my mom, everything needs to be perfect and superb.  But today I had a taste of it.  I looked at her for about 5 minutes while she packed the other customers' food and she just looked back at me.  Didn't say anything and finally she said , ""Did you order"".  i told her no and told her I wanted beef and broccoli.  She was not very helpful she just which one do you want. I wanted the lunch portion, i told her.  With a very disgruntled attitude, she said well then that means you want the cheaper one. Fine. Shes probably busy and was just trying to take orders.  When I went to give her my money and presented my hand to receive change, she didnt even look at me and slammed my change on the table. If I could jump over the table to shove my nickel down her throat, I would have done that.  The food here is great, don't get me wrong but if this place wants happy customers, I suggest the owner fire this ungrateful lady and replace her with someone who has a little more experience with human beings.  That is all.",2.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.0,12.6000003815,"review,service,exception,food,restaurant,wait,Chinese,mom,Service,service,fare,staff,someone,lady,Breakfast,food,dimsum,lunch,lady,stink attitude,mom,customers,one,dinner,everything,taste,prices,anything,beef,broccoli,good-Most,change,food,table,change,table,nickel,hand,throat,all,Bad,customers,money,owner fire,experience,human beings,place,orders,attitude,lunch portion,Fine,Shes","5,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,6,4,1,7,1,1,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,4,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1","0.117475360632,0.102471373975,0.0986826643348,0.0804051533341,0.0798003450036,0.0546758212149,0.0474894084036,0.0341166593134,0.0222734846175,0.0188242830336,0.0148135293275,0.0145369395614,0.0137946726754,0.0132038434967,0.013022121042,0.011950487271,0.0115969330072,0.0111217433587,0.0110812969506,0.0110812969506,0.0110647799447,0.0101003060117,0.00994275417179,0.0097315730527,0.00968171749264,0.00966880377382,0.00915540382266,0.00882787629962,0.00881892908365,0.00881892908365,0.00861089676619,0.00768739264458,0.00751225557178,0.00749500794336,0.00749500794336,0.00749013759196,0.00698211556301,0.00655764620751,0.00655338447541,0.00642563262954,0.00575124239549,0.00518302433193,0.00465694488958,0.00453458214179,0.00453458214179,0.00453458214179,0.00447745108977,0.00335133587942,0.00329486117698,0.00288488692604,0.0028803111054,0.00287822401151"

However, their service is not good.I called them if they deliver. They said yes. So I was asking some questions about food. It wasn't long. Then the worker asks me to send him all the inquiry through the text. That's weird. It is just faster to talk on the phone. Okay so I texted him.He says I need to order $30 worth of food just to get a delivery. My house is not that far. It is not even a mile from the restaurant. I said that is too much. Then he offers $20 minimum for delivery. Seriously, What is that? What kind if restaurant does this kind of bargain with customers? I am okay if that's a standard for all customers for delivery even though I won't order since that's crazy amount for short delivery. However, they are treating customers unequally.

So I ordered chicken Momo's and waited eagerly and they arrived in five minutes. They also gave us two different sauces to eat momos' with..I tried my first momo  without any sauce and it had very clean flavor  and juicy. And very authentic tasting. I had Momo's in India many times and it just tasted like home. The two sauces given were spicy which went very well.

They all hit the spot; tastes were all over the map - bitter - sweet - spicy - tangy - like i said; all over.Will definitely come back here again as the staff was attentive even tho it was lunch hour; they even asked us where we were from; its ok - this is Queens; everyone asks; not because of anything negative but because everyone is curious about other cultures. And it can always lead to a conversation. Nothing wrong with finding out about other cultures; as an added benefit; if they recognize you as a regular/local; they might give you special treatment next time.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,4934,"Maybe one of the best meals I have ever had. The experience was amazing and I am definitely coming back here in the future. Location is pretty good, right off of Roosevelt, two blocks away from the Little India section of Jackson Heights. It is on a side street, but parking isn't incredibly hard to find and it is very close to the train station. Decor is bland, a few tables, Nepalese decorations, a small kitchen, a fridge with drinks, and water bottles on every table. They don't encourage utensils, since that isn't the authentic way of dining, but they do have plenty of plastic ones. Service, despite a slight language barrier, was really friendly, got our order right, and were accommodating. Menu is simple and straightforward: a selection of Nepalese appetizers, including Tingmo (a doughy bread), goat head, chili, and a selection of meat appetizers. The do have a large selection of steamed and fried momos. Entrees consist of thali, served with all sorts of proteins and vegetables, soups, fried rice and chow mein, Thukpa, a Tibetan noodle soup, and curries. They do have a few drinks as well. I ordered a mango lassi, which had a strange texture, but tasted pretty good. Their tingmo is amazing, steamed to perfection, not too bland, sweet, fluffy. Their momos are fantastic. The steamed ones are served extremely hot, very flavorful with beef filling. Their fried ones are even better, not oily at all. Their chow mein is very good, very flavorful, lots of vegetables and perfect, thin noodles. Their thalis are recommended above all else. They are served with a choice of vegetable or meat, (beef, chicken, fish, goat, mutton, goat head, pork, etc.) steamed white rice, dal (lentil/pea based dish), a type of curry, saag (spinach/mustard greens), achar (a very spicy pickled dish), papad (a thin, crisp bread) and a soup which I don't know the name of. The beef thali was amazing, but the goat one is recommended. The goat was cooked perfectly, was spicy, and elevated the dish. The rice, saag, soup, and dal were unlimited, where they kept coming over to refill our metal plates. Each component was perfect, prepared correctly, and tasted amazing together and separately.

It's got elements of Indian and Chinese cuisine, with a great kick of spiciness. As everyone has said, the momo is pretty good, but I'm a sucker for the thali, which comes on a plate with an assortment of things: rice, a green lentil daal, a cauliflower potato masala type stew, pickles, sautéed vegetables and a meat of your choice (I've had the goat, fish and beef - all are spicy and delicious). Bring a friend and eat slowly. Eventually, the woman who works here will come over and refill your daal and vegetables, in case you haven't had enough. Though she's really kind, her English isn't great, so you may want to clarify that she's taken the right order if you're not totally sure. Don't come in expecting to be mindblown with intense and otherworldly flavors. The food is healthy, simple, and I could probably eat it every day.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,34074,"Lali Guras has a real outpost sort of feel. Location is at an ever-atmospheric corner off of Roosevelt Ave, with a diagonal view of the 7 Train passing. The clientelle seems to be Himalayan, sipping cheap chai, speaking softly to one another, and being distracted by old Bollywood films being shown on an TV. The kitchen itself is run by what seems to be a family, making simple Himalayan food out of a rickety commerical set-up. While the overhead sign describes American breakfast items, the printed menu sells an extremely tailored array of dumplings (momos), Tibetan noodle soups (thukpas), chaats, and Nepalese thalis (set meals). While everything is tasty and cheap (prices stay well under the $10 range), the uniqueness is a little to be desired. Lali Guras serves the type of food that you would eat if you were traveling in Northern India/Nepal/Tibet, stopped at a home roadside canteen on desolate highway. Enticing if you take comfort from the simplicity of a warm cup of Himalayan chicken noodle soup (thukpa), with thick noodles, strips of potatoes and carrots and cuts of dark-meat chicken; a piping hot cup chai served in a styrofoam cup; and the comforting grease from a meat-filled momo dumpling.

It's one of those restaurants I hesitate to review because it is such a hidden gem and yet I really want them to stay in business so I must write one.I used to live in Jackson Heights and frequent Lali Guras but I still go back often. Jackson Heights is the mecca of Himalayan/Nepalese/Tibetan food and I have tried many of these restaurants. This is the best one here from a taste and cost perspective. So what should you get?1. Chicken/Beef Sukuti Thali - $10: Sukuti is basically tender jerky with lots of spice and onion. It is seriously addicting. The rest of the thali involves mustered greens, dal, a delicious cauliflower or sometimes mushroom curry, pickled sauce and vegetable, rice, some onion, and a small wedge of lime. Oh and they also give you some beef thali broth (delicious) with the sukuti thali.2. Chicken momo. Not the beef quite as much. Better than all the other places I have tried. For beef momo go to AMDO Kitchen - the momo truck down the street.3. Mango lassi. Just because if any place has mango lassi I get one. On principle.

The thali had a variety of vegetables, dal (soupy lentils), acchars (spicy, pickled condiments) and papad (crispy wafer) to accompany a generous serving of rice. Everything was flavored perfectly.

There was some sharp bone in there. So be careful. Price wise it was pretty cheap. Mostly $10 and below. Cash only.Overall it I'm glad I went. It definitely was an experience.

Instead of admitting that they were out of mutton they decided to serve me more goat curry along with my order of goat thali. I could have ordered something else but instead lied right to my face. I called in our order to pick up. He asked me how long it would take me to get there.. that's a first. Got there in about 10 minutes and our order wasn't ready. I could sympathize because all the seats were taken and they seemed pretty busy. I asked again about the goat thali, mutton curry, and chicken momos we ordered by phone. I inquired further about the ""mutton"" curry and he tells me.. yes.. mutton curry but I heard him twice instructing his kitchen to make a goat thali and a goat curry. I really didn't think much of this as it was my first time here. Our order was ready and came out to $19. I had a short convo with him and left a dollar tip for them.When it was time to eat, I noticed pretty quickly that the smaller and larger containers of curries were both goat curries! wow really?

The waitstaff were a touch inattentive both when we arrived and throughout the meal but they were very warm and helpful. We started with selroti which was made fresh right before being served meaning it was still soft and warm. Then the momo's came which were good with a very good sauce. They compared well to what is found in momo shops in Kathmandu. Finally the dal bhat (thali) came out. The dal and saag were done perfectly. I also thought the spices in the vegetable were great but a bit on the spicy side for me (I do not have a very high threshold for spicy food). The achar was also very well done and all of it reminded me of the food I had eaten on Nepali farms. In addition to the food we ordered milk tea (dood chiya) and mango lassis. The mango lassis were sweet and I would probably go for a plain one next time. The milk tea was a little under-sweetened but both drinks were good and I would recommend them. As we started to finish the food on our plates, we were offered more rice, veg, and dal which is typical Nepali hospitality but not always replicated in the Nepali restaurants I have visited. Compared to other Nepali places in Jackson Heights, Lali Guras has comparable food if not better, better prices, but a more casual setting.The bottom line is if you come here you well be well taken care of and eat excellent food for a steal.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,124158,"Huge fan! We moved to Jax Hts from Wmsburg a few years ago. I'm embarrassed to admit it took us over a year to try out the amazing Tibetan restos around here. (We were busy enjoying all of the other wonderful cuisines to be found in the area, for sure, but we were a bit hesitant to try Tibetan food.) Worse yet, it's been 18 months since our first foray w/momos, and we finally tried out Lali Guras only last night! Walked by it a couple days ago and made a mental note to return. As seems usual, our other food came out before the momos we ordered.Counter-intuitive, since it seems apps should come out first, but they don't have hard fast rules. The food comes when ready. OMG, the fried pork momos were the lightest, crispy nuggets of meaty yumminess ever! The dough covering was barely thick enough to hold the inside delights together, so delicate. Of course the dipping sauces only add to the various taste explosions in my mouth.Drool!! I had the pork thali -- way more spicy than I could handle. I enjoyed the rice and lentils, ate all the mustard greens and had 5 or 6 bites of the spicy pork and 3 bites of a peas and beans side that was even hotter than the pork before switching with my hubby who ordered the mutton thentuk: a super-flavorful bowl of meat and handcut noodles w/handfuls of onions, cabbage, carrot and maybe tomato bits floating in the broth? DH said the pork thali was similar in spice flavoring to a vindaloo, which he adores. And they still gave him refills on the sides, even though we switched halfway through our meals. Wow, the whole dinner was so good! Will have to get a mango lassi next time. Service was a bit harried, because there is only 1 guy who is taking orders, bringing out your food, and refilling the thalis around the room. Still, all 3 staff were polite and friendly.All done? $20!! Can't go wrong, folks! Especially if you have someone who will switch w/you when you order incorrectly for your own palate.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,31224,"If you're not familiar with Nepali food you're in for a real treat. Lali Guras was the surprise of the century for me! The chef and owner here has a serious set of taste buds! I always order one of the thalis, which is traditionally a big round metal plate filled with smaller sauces, stews, sautéed veggies, pickled veggies, and hot sauce (sepen) all lined up around the metal plate. In the center is white rice piled high. Lali Guras offers chicken, fish, goat, and beef thali. The Chicken Thali is a good bet and sure to please. Fish is tasty too but you'll need a dexterous tongue--it's full of fish bones that you'll need to spit out! The star of the show for me is the Tibetan-style sepen sauce. Sepen is a very piquant chili sauce that seems to have hints of Sichuan peppercorn. It's pretty spicy but not like a call 911-level spicy.Another great dish is the thukpa, which is basically a bowl of noodles in soup with bits of grilled chicken and vegetables inside. The noodles are broad and flat, like chow fun, but the soup is very mild, not too salty, and slightly bland. It's great if you've been eating very salty, fried, or intensely flavored foods (e.g., Thai food) and want to take a break. I ordered the chicken thukpa and the chicken was grilled to perfection.For the most part, food here tastes home cooked in a really nice way. Like your Nepali friend's mom made it. It tastes healthy and fresh, like it doesn't have any strange additives or chemicals.Be aware that there is an open kitchen, so come in your casual washables and not expensive dry clean-only suit or dress. Depending on what they're cooking you might smell like food for a while.If you dine in someone will come by and refill your vegetable side dishes for free! I've gotten seconds only once because the portions are really generous. Did I mention the thali dishes are all $10 or less?!?I feel like Crazy Eddie shouting from the rooftops ""Great food, great deal, and the prices are IN-SA-A-A-A-A-ANE!""UPDATE: I had to dock a star because they have a tendency to switch takeout orders on you here--it's happened to me several times within 6 months, so I doubt if it's just a coincidence. I had ordered the Fish Thali and they gave me Vegetable Thali instead. It would have been fine for them to simply tell me that they had run out of fish; I would have just opted for chicken.

The chickpea curry was okay too, the chicken had a lot of flavor but oversalted, while the spinach had little salt. The chicken was disgusting to eat because I kept spitting tiny bones out... eww!!! My guest got dumplings and chow mein though, and the sauces they had in the bottles went really great with her dish. I did not like mine though.

And so started my MOMO crawl on a fine, chilly Sunday afternoon on Tibetan Row in Jackson Heights, Queens.  I visited Tashi Delek Momo Dumpling Palace, Lali Guras, Bhim's Cafe, and Potala cart...all around the block from each other, and a very easy MOMO crawl indeed.  Conveniently, they are located right off the 7 train (74th Street, Broadway stop).  All four stops on the MOMO crawl had very different dumplings.  While all four types of momos I tried today were good in their own way, I enjoyed the yellow sauce at Lali Gura the most.The momos are shaped in a half moon here.  The wrapper is a denser, chewier bite than the other 3.  Whereas Bhim's was impossibly thin, these were chewy.  I guess it depends on what you prefer - I like both ways!  I noted that these were a little hard and dry.  Freezer burn perhaps?  The filling had interesting flavor.  There are mild spices, very enjoyable.  Of all three spots I stopped today, this was the slowest.  It took a good 15-20 minutes to get my order here.  However, I did notice as I was waiting, that the sign on the door said 12-12 on Sundays.  I had arrived at 11:30am, and they were open, with another customer enjoying a paper and a beverage, so I assumed they were open.  But perhaps the kitchen had not been fired up yet.  When I ordered momos, the chef had to run down the basement and bring them upstairs..so I guess they were not ready yet.  I  noticed they were frozen dumplings.  Not that I expect them to fresh make dumplings with each order.  Not sure if they buy these bulk from somewhere or make them and freeze them.  The restaurant is small.  There are nice benches and two or three tables.  It is divvy - but in a cool kind of way.  Tibetan, Nepali newspapers lying around.  A woman sitting at a table staring at me for 20 minutes.  But I am third-generation Queens, so that kinda awkwardness doesn't scare me off from truly awesome food discoveries.  It kinda makes it an experience, an adventure.  To dip the momos came two sauces.  I did not enjoy the red sauce (at any stop today), because it was oily.  I loved the yellow sauce, the best sauce I tried today.  It really complements the momo flavor.  Very different than the soy-vinegar-ginger sauce at Chinese restaurants.  Very unusual, and very delicious.",3.0 star rating,"East Rutherford, NJ",3,1,0.10000000149,20.7999992371,"Momos,dumplings,dumplings,all - dumplings,article,wrapper,ravioli,manti,potstickers,perogi,shumai,name,MOMOS,places,each other,Tibetan Row,sauce,Serious Eats,Sara Markel-Gonzalez,74th Street,MOMO crawl,momos,momos,MOM,dumplings,yellow sauce,eh-hem,cart,block,Queens,stops,order,Mom,Bhim,customer,MOMO crawl,MOMO crawl,Momo Dumpling Palace,way,flavor,types,filling,ways,Lali Guras,train,moon,Freezer burn,spots,most.,woman,restaurant,spices,door,beverage,paper,Jackson Heights,Potala,Tashi Delek,Cafe,momos,sign,tables,way,kind,table,sauces,soy-vinegar-ginger sauce,sauce,Lali Gura,newspapers,food discoveries,awkwardness,benches,Broadway,stop,momo flavor,momos,restaurants,dumplings,adventure,Tibetan,Nepali,kitchen,dumplings,experience,bulk,order,chef,somewhere,Chinese,basement","7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,5,1,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,2,2,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,2,7,1,2,7,7,6,7,2,2,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,7","0.139715850353,0.0788270533085,0.0360331833363,0.0350011177361,0.0307411104441,0.0298047531396,0.0230699200183,0.0230699200183,0.0230699200183,0.0230699200183,0.0230699200183,0.0228688418865,0.020698627457,0.0187871474773,0.017000541091,0.0154924588278,0.0144137730822,0.0134623637423,0.0134623637423,0.0131399063393,0.010888854973,0.010784521699,0.010784521699,0.00992166716605,0.00920146610588,0.00868520606309,0.00868159346282,0.00865400210023,0.00865400210023,0.00831177830696,0.0078022647649,0.00778978457674,0.00766721088439,0.00759336771443,0.00743935862556,0.00734198465943,0.00732334097847,0.00668719876558,0.0066538034007,0.00661970395595,0.00642700120807,0.00617073848844,0.00595427304506,0.00585715379566,0.00583515223116,0.00582168390974,0.00579604133964,0.00578411482275,0.00574836554006,0.00553308334202,0.00551007967442,0.00543246464804,0.00528664793819,0.00528367003426,0.00521711958572,0.00513221556321,0.00512455869466,0.00512455869466,0.00512455869466,0.00503640249372,0.00489948084578,0.00449664425105,0.0044947755523,0.0044947755523,0.00449121417478,0.0041068312712,0.00410134904087,0.00405368302017,0.00393946608528,0.00393086345866,0.00392784317955,0.00392784317955,0.00369241833687,0.00345453829505,0.00341378012672,0.00334808742628,0.00320556410588,0.00310180499218,0.00288425898179,0.00271824980155,0.00265963864513,0.00232678977773,0.00225812429562,0.00211737584323,0.00210924982093,0.00206224550493,0.0019746623002,0.0018424151931,0.00172671000473,0.00160612445325,0.00087164301658"

Spicy lentils, delicious greens, yummy soup... an array of Nepalese fantasticness. And at the center of it all is the Chicken. It's a browny-yellow brilliantly made curry that is not too spicy, but not at all short on flavour. It rocked my world. I'd definitely order it extra spicy next time.If this were the place where all those poor creatures that walk off cliffs in that weird old video game, then it would be ""Lemmings Graveyard."" What? Was it a stretch? Wanna see something else stretch?This was my very first experience of Nepalese food and it was a wonderful one.

Service was great and friendly, the place is clean and spacious. I'm excited to come back for more already!!Here's what we ordered:- Goat thali ($9 with rice, $11 with dhindo): The goat was tender and flavorful. The veggie side dishes today were a lentil like soup, which I poured over my rice and ate at least two refills of, and the spiced potato mixture, also delicious and flavorful. It was so much fun to eat a thali and they come often with rice or any of the veggie side dishes. No judgments even after the second refill! The dhindo is interesting... I probably prefer the rice because it soaks up all the sauces better... but I had to try that purple glutinous looking thing at least once!- Samayabajee Sukuti/Bhutan (hot beef jerky, $7): This was interesting and new for me. The flattened rice added this really nice crunchy, crispy texture. The soybeans and chickpea were flavorful. The beef was good, a little dry but I think it's supposed to be like that since it's kind of a fried beef jerky thing. - Beef momos, steamed ($5): Definitely really cheap and good.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,65323,"This place is fantastic. People in Manhattan may consider this place a ""hole in the wall,"" but if you're from Queens, most likely you will think that Lali Guras is like exactly like a restaurant in your home country.First off, getting inside is pretty intimidating. AND IT'S AWESOME. I came in with 2 friends, and was seated within 15 seconds. Those 15 seconds included the waitress eyeing our seats, and asking the patrons who were already there to scoot over to make room for us. Baller status.The menu is simple. For all of our sakes, order the chicken thali. Or if you're a vegetarian, get the vegetable thali. Okay quick lesson (as if you haven't read this from other people's reviews):Thali: various dishes that make up one big dish. At Lali Guras, the thali consists of: - dal (lentil soup)- achard (spicy pickled condiments)- papad (crispy wafer)- chicken/vegetables (whichever ever is your main dish)Oh, and this is all only $8-9? But that's not the best part...THERE ARE FREE REFILLS OF FOOD. But after your second helping, you'll be stuffed.-- Sidenote --I truly loved my experience here. I think I found the man who eats with his hands (that Jason C. pointed out) and sat diagonally from him. He was awesome. He stared at me attempt to eat with my hands, laughed at me, and then TAUGHT me! Let's be real, y'all, food is the universal language. No words between us -- just food and laughter.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,2749,"Lali Guras, my dearest love. One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I wasn't even a fan of thalis until I started dining here.I was really sad when they were closed for renovations. Luckily, they re-opened a month or so ago. So amazing, since the vegetable thalis (my go-to order) at other restaurants nearby aren't as good.What's so great about this one? The mung bean dal is super flavorful; I think I've seen some cumin seeds in there. Not just watered-down, salty soup, like other places. I love how inventive they are with their vegetable (typically some kind of curry and/or stew). I've had a stew with lotus root there in the past. Recently, they had a shitake mushroom stew, and it was delicious! I think the main veg changes every week, which is awesome, since other places tend to have a consistent potato-curry-like veg, that's kind of watery and not well-seasoned. Forgive me for not knowing the precise names of dishes.The collard greens and the pickles provided (had a bitter melon one recently) are delicious as well. Someone mentioned here the portion sizes have gone down since their reopen. I believe that. I think customer service quality has gone down as well, unfortunately. Sometimes it's hard to flag down wait staff. I love that they refill the vegges (definitely a huge highlight, and I usually take my refill home), but sometimes they neglect to pass by the tables. :(My other love that they make fantastically well here is sel roti. Oh my, if you're a fan of crunchy, sweet deliciousness, look no further. So good!

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,12018,"I have no basis with which to review Nepali food as I'm not familiar with the culture, but I came with my partner who woof'd there for 6 months and has become quite attached, so we came to relive some of his memories. My review is purely based off of the taste, service, aesthetic, and feel.Upon entering and looking at the tables/seating, I was reminded of every other South Asian cafe I'd been to in Sri Lanka and in the Middle East - shoddy glazed wobbly tables, metal dishware, stale chairs with no bendability and that seem toy-like in weight - my kind of place. Water in pitchers and sauce is left on tables to be shared, just like in traditional SEAsian eateries. The service was attentive, coming around for extra rice and side-dishes when they saw we were almost done.We started off with the selroti - a mildly sweet rice-dough fried ring which was nice to start, and received out mango lassi and chia (chai tea) shortly after, accompanied by chicken momo (dumplings). The mango lassi was superb, but the chia wasn't sweet enough for my liking - it could have used some more condensed milk. It was good but tasted more savoury/umame than I would have liked. The chicken momo's had a great thin skin to them and the meat was very tender and succulent. Mixed with the orange dipping sauce, I could see myself eating it every day, which my partner used to do in Kathmandu. I'm sure Western foreigners would eat this right up since they're supremely fascinated by dumplings.For our main entree, I had the chicken main dish thali. The rice, daal, veggies and fried chip were great. The meat I didn't care for so much - dried red pieces of chicken without much flavour. I can't quite pinpoint it, but something elevated my sweat glands and overtook me in spicyness - the mango lassi certainly helped with this, but I was left panting.To speak of the service, the wait-staff was overly attentive with extra fixings - rice and side dishes, but they were a bit absent when it came to receiving the check, which I guess is a cultural norm (not pressuring customers with the bill). Overall, I enjoyed our meal and was thoroughly stuffed, but I can't see myself having this too often as there's a surprising amount of food that puts you in a coma.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,7.90000009537,"partner,basis,some,tables,culture,memories,food,service,Nepali,taste,review,mango lassi,ring,amount,metal dishware,tables,Water,chairs,service,bendability,weight,cafe,seating,aesthetic,mango lassi,chia,rice,side-dishes,mango lassi,meat,check,sauce,chia,chicken momo,dumplings,chicken momo,milk,sauce,place,kind,eateries,pitchers,chai tea,selroti,liking,fixings - rice,side dishes,skin,Middle East,South Asian,Sri Lanka,service,wait-staff,foreigners,sweat glands,spicyness,something,bit,SEAsian,speak,norm,Kathmandu,food,customers,bill,coma,meal,chicken,chicken,panting.To,meat,dish thali,entree,fried chip,veggies,daal,flavour,pieces,Western,rice","1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,5,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7","0.154372915626,0.116254679859,0.0529605746269,0.0503434799612,0.0464080572128,0.0464080572128,0.0438843779266,0.0278318673372,0.0275947190821,0.0221747905016,0.0221747905016,0.0215978790075,0.0172508750111,0.0117791155353,0.0114688444883,0.0106570729986,0.0105996038765,0.00969451107085,0.00851869210601,0.00848331488669,0.00848331488669,0.00848331488669,0.00848331488669,0.00848331488669,0.00808787345886,0.00772702274844,0.00767869781703,0.00767869781703,0.00731774466112,0.00704139703885,0.00692852772772,0.00651345495135,0.00648976070806,0.00648976070806,0.00648976070806,0.00628269882873,0.00595670798793,0.00588708790019,0.00572846224532,0.00572846224532,0.00569910835475,0.00569910835475,0.00567837245762,0.00567837245762,0.00566234020516,0.00517831323668,0.00517831323668,0.00515967374668,0.00502431765199,0.00502431765199,0.00502431765199,0.00481124129146,0.00457214890048,0.00429644947872,0.00422689411789,0.00382870808244,0.00382870808244,0.00382870808244,0.00337436702102,0.00337283639237,0.00328838871792,0.00304963556118,0.00302679580636,0.00265076383948,0.00265076383948,0.00264807464555,0.00261470791884,0.00227979663759,0.0022740024142,0.00226648594253,0.00192149425857,0.00168529618531,0.00168529618531,0.0016830455279,0.0016830455279,0.0016830455279,0.00168101221789,0.00168101221789,0.000997424358502,0.000985709950328"
Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,618,"Driving through the streets of Queens, New York resembled upper Nepal more than ever before. We had waited an hour on the runway for the gate to be cleared, just the third flight in after the reopening of the airport. The driver couldn't make it down the small side street off Broadway, so I did the last block on foot. I walked in the middle of the unplowed road and into this small store. It resembles a takeout Chinese operation that has been only slightly retrofitted to meet its new clientele. I stamped my inadequate sneakers to try and remove the snow, and ordered a plate of momo.The atmosphere is communal, both by choice and necessity. Every other person in the restaurant was Nepali. They didn't seem to know each other, but the small tables were filled in by different people. Containers of chili were passed down, along with sections of a locally printed Nepalese newspaper. My momo came, steaming and full of tender meat. Nearly everyone else had the thali. You see ""thali"" on menus around town, but a key part of the word has been lost to American dining practices. Here someone comes around with bowls of the main dishes, and you are allowed free refills of what you like.

Finally we went to order after waving down the waitress twice. Not even exaggerating, but they were literally out of half of the menu items. Ok, so we ordered and she kept coming back and asking us to choose something else, but couldn't explain what the other items were when we asked. We got our beef momos, which were warm, not hot. Then out came a bowl of chicken curry, despite the fact that we were sharing, there was only one spoon. We just made it work. The chicken was quite dry and chewy and also not hot. We had also gotten mango lassi, but had to ask again twice for it. We then waited for our thenthuk soup to come out, which took 45 minutes. The waitress never came over once to tell us it was taking a long time. Meanwhile, three tables next to us came in and out during the course of our whole meal.

The seating space had doubled, with more tables and room to move, and an actual  bathroom that I can squeeze in to. I ordered my usual, the bhutan goat thali, and tried something I hadn't ordered here before: alu dham (potatoes). The version of alu dham that I usually get elsewhere is very spicy and fragrant; Lali Guras' version was mild and cumin-y. Wasn't bad but not an improvement on a dish that a nearby restaurant excels at, and I would not order again. My bhutan thali was delicious as always, although after the renovations, the portions seem to be smaller (increased rent?). The thali was missing some dishes that it previously had, and the pickled bamboo shoots are now pickled sliced radishes. We suspected some dishes were missing but I knew the portions of each dish definitely were smaller because my BFF usually never finishes her food there, but she finished everything this time. They still come around for seconds of rice and the veggies though. Now that the seating is more comfortable and they seem to be more consistent with table service (before the renovations, we pretty much gave up on waiting to be served and would order at the register; now they have waitstaff that actually circulate the dining space), I have to give them back a star.

I started with the beef samee bajee ($5), which is a medley of fried spicy beef, crispy rice, soybeans, finely diced potatoes, lentils, and onions with a sauce. This is most definitely not an appetizer (my mistake -- I couldn't possibly finish both dishes I ordered). The samee bajee is addictively crunchy, the 'rice crispies' help balance out and calm your tongue from the heat of the fried beef.Then came the goat Thali -- which is actually a collection of several small dishes. The goat was delectable,  and, to my surprise, not very spicy, but just right. I could taste the chilies and garlic and ginger in the dish, but it never overpowered the taste of the goat itself. The side of lentils (a lentil soup basically) is comforting and unctuous, and actually tasted even better when I put the remainder of my samee bajee into the soup (it also mellows the spiciness). The potato curry dish was also delicious and reminiscent of Indian food. There were two side vegetables, including a spicy bitter melon salad, but I didn't really care for it -- too bitter for my personal preferences. Amazingly, they give FREE refills on the side dishes other than goat.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,3155,"Just ate lunch here and I already plan to go back in the near future. The place is a block off Roosevelt Avenue in a corner spot. A small casual joint with seating for about 12 people. I didn't know what to expect aside from seeing a couple food pics on Yelp, but decided to order the oft-pictured goat thali ($9) and was not disappointed. My friend ordered the pork version ($8), and we each ordered a mango lassi. The tender goat pieces were served bone-in, in an aromatic spicy stew base. The pork had a couple fattier pieces, was stewed in a similar base as the goat and was also superbly tender. The sides for the entree were curried potatoes with chickpeas, some type of buttery (mmmm) bean dhal, sautéed mustard greens, a creamy/spicy picked daikon, and a hot sauce. The lassi's were refreshing, not too thick, not too sweet, the color was very orange but I'm not sure if that was directly from the color of the mangos. It was a great accompaniment to the spiciness of the savory entree. Now this isn't a fancy place--you pay and order at the cashier in the front and take a seat where you can find one.

It is safe to say we are regular customers, and highly recommend this lovely little place. I make frequent visits to Nepal for work, during which time I have been able to enjoy the Nepali cuisine in different settings. I've had momos at cafes in Kathmandu and incredible thalis in village kitchens along the Annapurna transect. And so - I can safely vouch for the authenticity of the food here!As for their food, thalis are a must. We typically get the vegetarian thali (great) and the boyfriend has also had the chicken (good) and goat (better). All thalis come with a heaping portion of nicely steamed rice with a papad on top. The dal is heavenly. The water spinach is seasoned just right and quite refreshing. The bhaji (vegetable curry) is often varied, but always delicious; we prefer the aloo. Pickled sides serve as a colorful and spicy addition to the simple yet perfect flavors of the thali.Because we love the thalis so much, we don't often order the other options on the menu but have no doubt they would be equally enjoyable. The momos are good too.Perhaps best of all is the service provided in this cozy, home-style kitchen. The staff is always welcoming and offers refills on many of the thali components.

Lali Guras,5371,3763 76th St,Jackson Heights,11372.0,1054,"First time trying Nepalese/Himalayan food!! I would say it's like a milder version of Indian food with some Chinese influences and to a lesser extent some Korean and Southeast Asian flavors as well. Place is literally a hole-in-the-wall with only three tables available and probably seats 12 people max in the entire restaurant!! So don't expect waitstaff nor table service. But that doesn't mean the food isn't good nor authentic. Although the Nepalese lady (they look Chinese but they're Nepalese so please don't say Ni Hao Ma you ignorant rednecks!!) who worked both the counter and brought out the food spoke limited English, she was very pleasant and didn't have that 'cold' attitude that you typically get at Chinese take-out restaurants. We ordered two appetizers: the Bhutan and the Choila. And for the main course we had to get the Dhido Thalli which is like a set menu and their signature national dish. The Choila are basically spicy chilled beef jerky topped with fresh onions and cilantro and served cold. I thought this would make the perfect anju to go with a pitcher of cold beer. Good stuff though. The Bhutan dish was similar but instead of served chilled, this was lightly fried and made of Goat meat. Texture reminded me of a softer version of the common Chicharron or Pork Rinds you can find at many Latin American restaurants. Good stuff indeed as wellNow...the Thalli, this was served on a HUGE metal platter. The presentation reminded me of a cross between Korean side dishes, Indian Daal, and Ethiopian meal of Injera bread and Wat or Stew. Not sure of the name, but the main starch was in the center and surrounding it were three different stews: one of lentils and beans, one of fatty meat, and one of some vegetarian stew with vermicelli noodles. There were also small portions of 'sides' as well including a steamed spinach+broccoli dish, spicy radish, and a mildly spicy red stew/sauce with anchovies. Seriously the Thalli alone was a fun and eye opening experience into a new cuisine and culture. -Restrooms Available behind the counter (it says Employees-Only) but its a restroom -Surprisingly WiFi access available!!!

That many dim sum people on a weekday? I can't even imagine weekends. Perhaps it's the first stop after the LIE on main street and the location that drives or it could be their AMAZING selection and huge variety of dim sum options. Another thing that shocked me for a dim sum restaurant on a Wednesday is the wait for a table of five. Like seriously??? First the parking lot and now wait for the table. Am I at Disney world? Wait after wait... it better be worth it I thought! We got a table fairly quickly - less than FIVE minutes but I can't imagine a weekend getting a table here. I think I will avoid it at all COST. Once the dim sum carts started rolling, I began to see why there are so many people here. There were literally carts and carts of fresh steamed, fried, cooked plates of dim sum. And the food was quite good and delicious. I asked my parents if they had a dim sum special pricing for the weekdays here and they do NOT. I said, why are so many people here paying regular price for dim sum on weekends when Flushing had so many other choices. I saw the answer. Restaurant decor is up to date and CLEAN. Service is attentive. Food choices was AMAZING. Comfort of space between tables and chairs was ideal - you didn't feel like you sat on top of people and the noise volume was manageable.

You can never find street parking and when there is no more space in their private lot my family and I turn around and find another restaurant. But the last two times we manage to get parking space! For dim sum we came here for mother's day. utensils aren't very clean and table and chairs aren't clean either but it expected for most dim sum restaurants. Food comes out fast and efficient. If you wait till after 11am they will come out with any fried, stir fry, and you can order from their lunch menu. Their fried flat noodles that comes from those dim sum carts is a little spicy but it is amazing! Their dim sums are all legit and great! Would come here more often if finding parking space isn't an issue.For dinner...what my family ordered two weeks ago... it was.....the....best..........dinner......experience EVER!!!!!! YES I said it! The wait wasn't so bad but they seated us in front of all their utensils so it was inconvenient for the waiters to grab stuff. Besides that we order things that we never seen in other restaurants. Like their duck intestines stir fry with green peppers in black fermented sauce. This dish was amazing! If you translate it to Chinese it sounds a lot better I promise. we also ordered Hong Kong style pork chop with fried tofu skin wraps, Chinese steak, yee mein with seafood, and chicken with mushrooms and radish.

They probably make most of their money on dim sum and banquet patrons, so service suffers if you're not in those categories. I can only speak to the dim sum side of things, as I've never gone here for anything else. I can tell you, the quality of the dim sum is consistently good, in my opinion generally better than Asian Jewels for example. If you're familiar with Jade Asian, I'd say it's about on par, but maybe slightly better than that even. Very affordable. One caveat: there have been a couple occasions where the shrimp dumplings (虾饺, har gow) had wrappers that just fell apart. Take that for what its worth, since a lot of people judge a dim sum place by that specific dish. Like I said though, the rest of it is solid.

Although the language barrier is partially there, our love for food is our mutual language.Entering Lake Pavilion at 1:00pm on Sunday afternoon, I observed a massive, banquet sized dining room that was empty minus two tables which sat men and women dressed in white at one and men and women in black at the other.As the light went on in my head that food service for lunch was a thing of the past and the people (in black and white) eating were staffers, my neighbor talked to management and we were seated. As I do not know the native tongue nor able to read emotions, I think it was not a major problem. Unfortunately I can not tell you exactly what the four items we were served by name, as my neighbor never looked at the menu, rather he discussed with the waiter what was available and in ten minutes the food was served. One Roast Pork dish, succulent meat with a beautifully crusted outside portion. The fried tofu was sauced and served with a deep green leafy vegetable, similar to escarole. The fried fish, similar to flounder in texture flaky, light and very tasty followed by a chicken curry dish. Each dish was so very unique and authentic in comparison to the small store front Chinese food locations in my area and the surrounding areas. I felt compelled to purchase extra to take home, which I did..If you read the seafood menu portion of their menu, some of the more unusual but interesting items are Sauteed, Stewed or Steamed Frogs, Abalone & Preserved Seafood portion lists Braised Sea Cucumber in Oyster Sauce and a full listing of Shark's Fin offerings.

They have valet parking in the back that is pretty chaotic, but they always find you a spot, for it's about $3. It's kinda one of the better places my family chooses to dimsum in. The decor is cheesier than other places - silly angel chandeliers included.  Coming in a large group will probably land you a table on the top part (where the bride and groom typically sit during Chinese wedding banquets), but that's not too bad. You really can't get food if you get a ""private"" room. It's really hard to fetch the cart ladies, even when they come the food is already gone - so be ready to chase them if you end up in a room with only you and your family/friends in it. The wait is seriously shorter if you know someone who works here so use your guanxi skills. lol That waiting area gets ridiculous tho. The dimsum food is ok. Not mediocre - even for a master dimsum hater such as myself. I kinda like their baked pork buns (char siu bao) - which come with the ""pineapple"" top. I haven't had a bad dumpling here - but don't be that guy who gets XLB during dimsum then complains about it not being the best, because there are places for that and you are just trying to fool yourself. Do get the shrimp dumplings (har gow). I like their rice flour steamed rolls (cheung fun) too. Congee is not bad and very filling. Definitely get the turnip cakes (law bak gow) if they are still hot, and the same applies to the egg tarts, although I'm the type of person who'd stuff her face with egg tarts even if they were frozen...

The food was very bland lacking in taste nothing worth really talking about , instead it felt like a bowl of salt as I felt the three dishes were all too salty.  So as we finished our dishes we were greeted to some oranges to finish up not bad.  So I must say it's just nothing special to me!  Food could use less salt and more taste!  I prefer the Corner 28 restaurant down in the heart of Flushing by far to be the best Chinese restaurant.  Also on another positive note it takes credit card unlike other most Chinese restaurants.",2.0 star rating,"Queens Village, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"Flushing,Red Bowl,work,spot,plan,coworker,Pho,hostess,food,Hoang,mouth,table,someone,whatever,service,crowd,much,order,anyone,seafood menu,table,something,seafood,dishes,someone,order menu,menu,beef,awhile,side,tea,no,broccoli,fried rice,pork chop,dishes,nothing,bowl,salt,restaurant,oranges,Food,restaurant,restaurants,credit card,nothing,salt,taste,heart,note,Prices,Food,table,dishes,Chinese,one,Corner 28,portions","2,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,3,2","0.195847809315,0.0932770892978,0.0720845907927,0.0570380464196,0.0411425754428,0.0344927608967,0.0344927608967,0.033380843699,0.0315620414913,0.0204687286168,0.0180302001536,0.0164434928447,0.0161223225296,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0129235591739,0.0123361106962,0.0110509581864,0.0110107809305,0.0110107809305,0.0103102102876,0.0100618321449,0.0100484164432,0.0100484164432,0.00978673435748,0.00915246177465,0.00885064527392,0.00881631206721,0.00877881795168,0.00876398198307,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00747690256685,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.00632576318458,0.00595033960417,0.00516864191741,0.00516467122361,0.00516093056649,0.00478163547814,0.00470493640751,0.00470108864829,0.00470108864829,0.0041098059155,0.00410682847723,0.00381957809441,0.00363743188791,0.00329415220767,0.00324184051715,0.00313625950366,0.00261796475388,0.00243274052627,0.00113215181045"

We finished the first har gow, lifted the bamboo steamer and realized that under there was another siu mai. So i told a waitress...she looked at me clueless, then brought over a manager, who was obviously doubting me. Seriously, would i waste time arguing about an effin dim sum?! So he canceled an order of siu mai and i said he should have canceled an order of hargow since i only got one of them. He then got frustrated and asked me which dim sum auntie served me...he eventually brought her over and she goes i remember! You ordered two har gow and 1 siu mai! I said I know, but i got two siu mai and 1 har gow! She goes no you didnt. (Yes, apparently I am now blind and do not know what is blantantly right in front of me?)

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,107421,"Came here for family gathering/wedding celebration dinners The location is very convenient, it's close to the highway (my family drives here from Brooklyn). It's also hard to miss even at night since it has a big sign with bright lights surrounding the restaurant. There's parking, but you have to pay tips. It's also hard to find a parking spot near the restaurant. When I had dinner in their private room, there was one staff per table and they spent time arranging the food, making sure there was enough for everyone. They also gave us time to take photos. We ate expensive looking foods(birds nest and seafood in papaya), but I felt like the main purpose of the special foods and expensive prices was presentation since the price didn't seem like it was worth it and it was in a small portion. They advertise expensive food around the restaurant. I saw soup prices near the bathrooms and the exit to the parking lot. My aunt reserved more than half the restaurant for her wedding celebration. There wasn't as much staff to a table as in the private room, and they seemed rushed. They kept asking us if we needed help dividing the food. I kept saying no, but they eventually started dividing it. I heard another waitress tell the one who was assigned to my table to hurry up and go get the other food. The food was okay, but it seemed like it was made in a hurry. We had rice, and the rice still had big chunks of rice stuck together. What I didn't like was that the waitresses and waiters didn't distribute the cake properly. I tried asking for cake, but they seemed to only distribute it to the other side of the room.

But it was only until last night that I treated myself to their banquet style dinner. I was pleasantly delighted.I entered the large hall and sniffed the air. It was clean and cool, not like the normal rancid air of other Flushing Chinese restaurants. Neatly manicured rows of plants decorated the edges. I was impressed by the hygiene of the restaurant -- white tablecloths on every table and the wait staff was dressed in matching purple and white outfits.Then we ordered and the food came. In each dish that arrived, I could taste the ""wok hay"" -- a term meaning spirit of the wok that breathes out of the food. Sautéed sea whelks in fish sauce were juicy and steaming (albeit small). Lamb chops were tender and not gamy and served atop a mountain of onions. Steak with fried bean curd was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and served with an addictive sauce, and the side of bean curd it was served with had crispy edges. I also enjoyed their cold crab served with vinegar sauce, (a specialty from Chao Zhou), a beast I estimated at around three pounds, when most other competitors serve theirs at a meager 1.5-2 lbs. Even the vegetables were fantastic; at one point I found myself shoveling forkfuls of sugar pea shoots topped with dried scallop threads into my mouth. Luckily, I felt more excitement and joy than embarrassment!!!Service is polite, efficient, and professional. We were offered plate changes often and even warm hand towels at two instances.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4009,"Lake Pavilion is a throwback to the old banquet halls that have become a rare sight in any of the Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn.  Classic Cantonese cooking is being overtaken by Taiwan, Shanghai, Szechuan and other regional cuisines du jour.  It is remembered as the central style of Chinese cooking in the US for the last 50-70 years mainly because it was the largest immigrant group during that time.  I recognize the manager from the restaurant on Main St & Franklin years ago, but the name escapes me now.  This newer version just off the LIE is a facelift of the old place.Wedding, full-moon, anniversary and birthday banquet style meals are their specialty, especially with rare ingredients that I think the chef relishes in preparing.  The more offbeat, the better to show off the skills and originality.  In addition to the main dining room, several private party rooms are available for 10-30+ people.During a recent dinner, we saw some wild dishes coming out of the kitchen such as spiny lobster salad, seared wagyu beef served table side and winter melon soup still in the melon.  Several Peking (Beijing) ducks were wheeled out on service carts to be sliced and served as well.  Our food was way more pedestrian, but I want to try some of that exotic stuff next time.  The wait staff was a well-oiled machine with food flowing out of the kitchen at a fast clip, water & tea constantly refilled and dishes cleared at a serious pace.Dim sum during the weekends are another matter with a constant crowd from late morning to mid afternoon.  Dim sum dishes are solid, tasty and are also a little larger than those at nearby Good Fortune (formerly East Manor). For instance, the pan-fried pork dumplings are 4 per dish (3 at GF) and the shrimp sprimg rolls are 5 per dish (4 at GF).  Good Fortune might have the edge in variety, but I think Lake Pavilion has the edge in taste.  As others have said, the parking lot out back can't handle the traffic flow, so I always look for street parking and can usually find it.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,6.40000009537,"cooking,banquet halls,Lake Pavilion,throwback,sight,any,pedestrian,Chinatowns,Manhattan,Queens,Brooklyn,specialty,cuisines,meals,ingredients,Shanghai,Szechuan,Taiwan,Cantonese,version,Good Fortune,some,cooking,style,wagyu beef,immigrant group,restaurant,name,dishes,manager,food,dining room,kitchen,wait staff,party rooms,table side,melon,chef,Wedding,LIE,originality,addition,dinner,spiny lobster salad,dish,dish,winter melon soup,service carts,ducks,stuff,US,Chinese,Main St,Franklin,skills,instance,shrimp sprimg rolls,pork dumplings,Beijing,edge,edge,street parking,Fortune,variety,taste,parking lot,GF,matter,others,traffic flow,dishes,East Manor,dishes,sum,kitchen,food,machine,clip,water,tea,weekends,crowd","7,2,2,7,1,7,1,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,2,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,4,1","0.130523085594,0.109744682908,0.0570365041494,0.0544863119721,0.0499390214682,0.0440826937556,0.0300570037216,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0258979927748,0.0211093816906,0.0137298135087,0.0137298135087,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.009785188362,0.00940237380564,0.00929717998952,0.00919179897755,0.00919179897755,0.00880609173328,0.00856953859329,0.00801503937691,0.00801503937691,0.0077169216238,0.007062332239,0.00669086258858,0.00614296458662,0.00614296458662,0.00584708526731,0.00576611841097,0.00565461441875,0.00562192080542,0.00560730136931,0.0053982688114,0.0053982688114,0.00538581889123,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00524252653122,0.00524252653122,0.00491926679388,0.00491095380858,0.00491095380858,0.00490363221616,0.00476573593915,0.00476573593915,0.0047484007664,0.0047484007664,0.00402456102893,0.00365075119771,0.0034266023431,0.0034266023431,0.00290809292346,0.00288631906733,0.00288631906733,0.00288360891864,0.00277861906216,0.00252526043914,0.00252526043914,0.00252288929187,0.00247053010389,0.0024391207844,0.00233809789643,0.00219447934069,0.00216409633867,0.00216382928193,0.0021614828147,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00171019916888,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318"

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4009,"Lake Pavilion is a throwback to the old banquet halls that have become a rare sight in any of the Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn.  Classic Cantonese cooking is being overtaken by Taiwan, Shanghai, Szechuan and other regional cuisines du jour.  It is remembered as the central style of Chinese cooking in the US for the last 50-70 years mainly because it was the largest immigrant group during that time.  I recognize the manager from the restaurant on Main St & Franklin years ago, but the name escapes me now.  This newer version just off the LIE is a facelift of the old place.Wedding, full-moon, anniversary and birthday banquet style meals are their specialty, especially with rare ingredients that I think the chef relishes in preparing.  The more offbeat, the better to show off the skills and originality.  In addition to the main dining room, several private party rooms are available for 10-30+ people.During a recent dinner, we saw some wild dishes coming out of the kitchen such as spiny lobster salad, seared wagyu beef served table side and winter melon soup still in the melon.  Several Peking (Beijing) ducks were wheeled out on service carts to be sliced and served as well.  Our food was way more pedestrian, but I want to try some of that exotic stuff next time.  The wait staff was a well-oiled machine with food flowing out of the kitchen at a fast clip, water & tea constantly refilled and dishes cleared at a serious pace.Dim sum during the weekends are another matter with a constant crowd from late morning to mid afternoon.  Dim sum dishes are solid, tasty and are also a little larger than those at nearby Good Fortune (formerly East Manor). For instance, the pan-fried pork dumplings are 4 per dish (3 at GF) and the shrimp sprimg rolls are 5 per dish (4 at GF).  Good Fortune might have the edge in variety, but I think Lake Pavilion has the edge in taste.  As others have said, the parking lot out back can't handle the traffic flow, so I always look for street parking and can usually find it.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,6.40000009537,"cooking,banquet halls,Lake Pavilion,throwback,sight,any,pedestrian,Chinatowns,Manhattan,Queens,Brooklyn,specialty,cuisines,meals,ingredients,Shanghai,Szechuan,Taiwan,Cantonese,version,Good Fortune,some,cooking,style,wagyu beef,immigrant group,restaurant,name,dishes,manager,food,dining room,kitchen,wait staff,party rooms,table side,melon,chef,Wedding,LIE,originality,addition,dinner,spiny lobster salad,dish,dish,winter melon soup,service carts,ducks,stuff,US,Chinese,Main St,Franklin,skills,instance,shrimp sprimg rolls,pork dumplings,Beijing,edge,edge,street parking,Fortune,variety,taste,parking lot,GF,matter,others,traffic flow,dishes,East Manor,dishes,sum,kitchen,food,machine,clip,water,tea,weekends,crowd","7,2,2,7,1,7,1,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,2,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,4,1","0.130523085594,0.109744682908,0.0570365041494,0.0544863119721,0.0499390214682,0.0440826937556,0.0300570037216,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0258979927748,0.0211093816906,0.0137298135087,0.0137298135087,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.009785188362,0.00940237380564,0.00929717998952,0.00919179897755,0.00919179897755,0.00880609173328,0.00856953859329,0.00801503937691,0.00801503937691,0.0077169216238,0.007062332239,0.00669086258858,0.00614296458662,0.00614296458662,0.00584708526731,0.00576611841097,0.00565461441875,0.00562192080542,0.00560730136931,0.0053982688114,0.0053982688114,0.00538581889123,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00524252653122,0.00524252653122,0.00491926679388,0.00491095380858,0.00491095380858,0.00490363221616,0.00476573593915,0.00476573593915,0.0047484007664,0.0047484007664,0.00402456102893,0.00365075119771,0.0034266023431,0.0034266023431,0.00290809292346,0.00288631906733,0.00288631906733,0.00288360891864,0.00277861906216,0.00252526043914,0.00252526043914,0.00252288929187,0.00247053010389,0.0024391207844,0.00233809789643,0.00219447934069,0.00216409633867,0.00216382928193,0.0021614828147,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00171019916888,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318"

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,40444,"I first came to Lake Pavilion years ago for dim sum and was neither disappointed nor impressed. But it was only until last night that I treated myself to their banquet style dinner. I was pleasantly delighted.I entered the large hall and sniffed the air. It was clean and cool, not like the normal rancid air of other Flushing Chinese restaurants. Neatly manicured rows of plants decorated the edges. I was impressed by the hygiene of the restaurant -- white tablecloths on every table and the wait staff was dressed in matching purple and white outfits.Then we ordered and the food came. In each dish that arrived, I could taste the ""wok hay"" -- a term meaning spirit of the wok that breathes out of the food. Sautéed sea whelks in fish sauce were juicy and steaming (albeit small). Lamb chops were tender and not gamy and served atop a mountain of onions. Steak with fried bean curd was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and served with an addictive sauce, and the side of bean curd it was served with had crispy edges. I also enjoyed their cold crab served with vinegar sauce, (a specialty from Chao Zhou), a beast I estimated at around three pounds, when most other competitors serve theirs at a meager 1.5-2 lbs. Even the vegetables were fantastic; at one point I found myself shoveling forkfuls of sugar pea shoots topped with dried scallop threads into my mouth. Luckily, I felt more excitement and joy than embarrassment!!!Service is polite, efficient, and professional. We were offered plate changes often and even warm hand towels at two instances.

It's also hard to miss even at night since it has a big sign with bright lights surrounding the restaurant. There's parking, but you have to pay tips. It's also hard to find a parking spot near the restaurant. When I had dinner in their private room, there was one staff per table and they spent time arranging the food, making sure there was enough for everyone. They also gave us time to take photos. We ate expensive looking foods(birds nest and seafood in papaya), but I felt like the main purpose of the special foods and expensive prices was presentation since the price didn't seem like it was worth it and it was in a small portion. They advertise expensive food around the restaurant. I saw soup prices near the bathrooms and the exit to the parking lot. My aunt reserved more than half the restaurant for her wedding celebration. There wasn't as much staff to a table as in the private room, and they seemed rushed. They kept asking us if we needed help dividing the food. I kept saying no, but they eventually started dividing it. I heard another waitress tell the one who was assigned to my table to hurry up and go get the other food. The food was okay, but it seemed like it was made in a hurry. We had rice, and the rice still had big chunks of rice stuck together.

The steak was really tender and flavorful. And the au jus was so good I poured it on everything. I don't normally like steak, but this was just so good!! Unfortunately, the waffle fries were cold and tasted stale. The fried rice was really fluffy, the golden raisins added sweetness against the salty shaved cured eggs. And sliced broccoli stems added great crunch. The service was unfortunately non existent. No one came to change our plates or portion the fried rice for the guest, like most Chinese restaurants do.

Their fried dough wrapped in rice noodle is pretty popular, worth a try!

If the tea selection they offer isn't good enough for the tea connoisseur in you, no worries, it's byot! Bring that dragonwell or oolong and they will gladly prep it for you.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,76914,"Not Horrible, Not GreatI came for dim sum lunch, arriving at 12:45 on a Saturday. The parking lot was full, but I found parking on the street. As soon as I stepped inside, it was pretty chaotic.Now, I've been to plenty of dim sum places, and they are usually chaotic, with the shouting of numbers and hungry people swarming the hostess. But that's a controlled chaos. Here, it was just chaotic. The hostess was situated sort of in the middle of the front, where people were coming at her from the front door AND the back where the parking lot entrance was. Then she had who I am assuming was her superior yelling at her, basically saying ""what the heck are you doing, give the larger group the table, not have 3 parties share!"". This superior came to yell at the hostess at least 3 times while I was waiting for a table - 15 minutes.When my boyfriend and I were seated, we ended up sharing the table with a party of 3, which was fine. They set plates in front of us and eventually brought the tea, and then a couple of food carts came by. That's when we - all 5 of us - realized they forgot to bring us chopsticks.It didn't take very long for them to rectify the situation, and we ordered a couple of dishes from the 2 carts. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. This place is pretty big, so I was surprised to find that there were only FOUR carts rolling, and they were going so slow. We ended up ordering something from the kitchen instead of waiting for the carts to reach us.  And when they did, the selections were pretty basic. Nothing special, and everything tasted fine. Again, nothing special. What we got from the kitchen, though - pan fried noodles with shredded pork - was excellent.I would not come here again. It was out of the way and pretty ordinary overall. I'd much rather go to Asian Jewel across from Flushing mall, or the new Grand Restaurant on the 3rd floor of the giant complex on Main Street.

To top it off, they would not accept our credit card because we ordered two dim sum dishes as part of our meal. Mind you, our total bill was nearly $250. Because of two dishes that totaled $10, they would not accept credit card. WHAT. THE. HECK? What kind of lame excuse of a policy is that? Let's call a spade a spade, ladies and gentlemen. When establishments like this see a credit card, they cower in fear over the merchant fees associated with it. I get it, you're a business and it cuts into profits. You know how businesses deal with that? They just don't accept it. Cash only. Boom, simple as that. If you can't deal with merchant fees, why bother accepting credit cards in the first place? Why ruin an otherwise already lackluster meal with stupid made up policies like this? I should have just sat there at the table, card in hand, until they gave up. That way, we'll see what they like better, a table being taken up on a busy day, or sucking up and taking a 1-2% merchant fee.Speaking of stupid policies and rules, they state that parking is free but you have to tip $2. Like, you HAVE to or else your keys are withheld. Valet parking should always be tipped, but its also up to the driver to tip how much. Mind you, the valet parking is also super slow when busy (I waited so long that a street parking spot opened up and I just did it myself). And the parking lot is tiny, why the hell is there even valet parking???? Oh right, another way to make a quick buck. It's not free parking. It's $2 parking.

The Chinese name of this place, ""Dong Yun Ge"" is of a very good Chinese restaurant that used to be at Franklin Ave. and Main St. I think it's because it named itself ""East Lake"" that the restaurant was able to create a buzz for itself. (When it first opened, it attracted a lot of attention from the Chinese community)First off the renovation from the old Palace Diner, which was what this restaurant used to be before it became this restaurant. Not too much has changed on the outside of the restaurant except that they stuck on the ugly restaurant signage and tacky LED lights. The inside of the restaurant however is a hot mess. Other dim sum restaurants like Asian Jewels, Jade Asian and East are tastefully decorated/renovated. Here the inside is a mismatch of ugly wood, weird marble pillars, ugly carpeting, ugly chandeliers and a huge bright LED sign over at their dragon and phoenix wall. It shocks me as to how they were able to change such a beautiful diner like Palace Diner into this particular monstrosity.I ordered the usual dim sum foods that I would at any other dim sum restaurant and it's hands down terrible. The ngau pak yi (Beef tripe) was overly tender, the congee didn't taste good, the cheong fun was blah and their fried rice tasted like white rice with yellow food coloring.Overall, this place is ugly to sit in, the food isn't good and parking costs $2 (Though, to be fair all dim sum restaurant require you to pay $2 for parking. Here, they've put up a sign in Chinese that says that $2 tips are compulsory) and you have to park the car yourself.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,76888,"Okay, so finally I went for dinner... and sorry but it beat out every other cantonese option in Flushing and probably all of NYC. The only reason to go Imperial Palace is for the Dung. Crab, literally Lake Pavillion executed every dish I order at imperial with superior skill. 1. Winter melon soup - 4.3/5, outstanding broth, full of seafood, but would have liked it to be a bit hotter.2. Sauteed Filet of Flounder - 5/5, the fish literally melted in my mouth, it was so soft and full of flavor, it was really enjoyable, it was served over a bed of chinese broccoli and some other veggies which made it very refreshing.3. Salt baked squid - 4.5/5, so lightly fried, it was much less greasier than other restaurants make it, decent sized pieces of squid, extremely tasty and great way to start off the meal. 4. Pan Fried Noodles w/ Beef - 5/5, this might actually be my favorite food on earth, if I was forced to eat one thing for every meal for the rest of my life, it might just be this. I first ate pan fried noodles as a real young buck at East Lake (former restaurant of the owners of Lake Pavilion) about 15 years ago. Since East Lake closed, it was extremely hard to find any restaurant that made this dish anywhere near as good. Imperial's version is not bad, nor is Jade Asian's- even the place on 38th ave does a decent job... but lets face it, Lake Pavilion's version blows everyone else out of the water, perfectly crispy noodles, their sauce could not have been more on point - it was not too starchy but had the perfect thickness to it. Fresh broccoli and delicious beef, perfectly executed.5. Peking Pork Chops - 5/5, I have never in my life had such a juicy and meaty version of Peking Pork chops, even when Silver Pond was still around (used to be at the corner of main and booth memorial across from the hospital and killed this dish), the pork chops were not soaked in sauce like some restaurants do, but rather perfectly glazed, lightly fried, so you could actually taste the sauce and the meat and it was truly a pleasure. As for the service, the lady who waited on us, told us she recognized us from Dim Sum a week ago, she was very pleasant and took really good care of us. I actually felt that the service was much better than any other Chinese restaurant in Flushing, as the service was broken down into different parts, it wasn't the same guy with an upset face bringing you every dish, interesting for such an establishment. The owner as well came over and said he recognized us from his previous restaurant. Love this place, I guess no other restaurant in Flushing will see me for a long long long long time... bye bye imperial, maybe you can find me at M&T, see you in a month Nan Xiang since can't get XLB here and your food is good, Jade Asian it was nice knowing you, and Red Bowl maybe if im drunk and you're open we can meet again.

Every time we come here, it is packed, whether it is for dim sum or dinner.  Only once it was not packed and the reason for that was that they were preparing for a wedding. Many wedding are held there and just today when i went there, there were more than two birthday parties. If you like chinese food and want to hold a party or want to eat at a place that serves more authentic food than typical chinese restaurants, this is your place to go.I personally like the dim sum in the Golden Unicorn restaurant in another ny chinatown, but the dim sum here is good. What i do like, is the stuff they serve for dinner, or at least what we order. They served a variety of seafood dishes from different styles of shrimps to fish to squid to lobster to black snail (or whatever you call them) to jellyfish and other stuff i dont have the courage to try. They also serve this steak that had too much sauce on it (had to remove some) that tastes slightly of oyster sauce and my mom told me later that it had red wine on it which worried me a bit but it came with waffle fries so i was happy. Although it was not as impressive, there was this humungous bowl of fried rice using sticky rice and snow crabs. There was also supposed to be quail but they ran out :(This restaurant actually serves dessert which most chinese restaurants dont do, they serve this sweet red bean soup and orange slices, not sure if they have anything else, probably do though.All in all, i like this restaurant and it is somewhere that one should visit with their family and/or friends.",4.0 star rating,"Roselle, NJ",2,1,0.20000000298,4.19999980927,"sum,times,visit,cousins,queens,family,steak,place,place,dinner,restaurants,whatever,dessert,wedding,reason,one,food,wedding,party,restaurant,restaurant,restaurants,stuff,sum,food,dinner,chinese,variety,stuff,sauce,chinatown,shrimps,styles,seafood dishes,snail,jellyfish,squid,lobster,courage,some,quail,fried rice,rice,red wine,birthday parties,bowl,snow crabs,restaurant,Golden Unicorn,friends,family,all,red bean soup,slices,anything,somewhere,oyster sauce,waffle fries,mom,bit","7,7,4,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,4,4,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,6,7,2,3,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7","0.101740337908,0.071849167347,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0603131093085,0.0477837212384,0.044764071703,0.036592900753,0.0344087556005,0.0311959329993,0.0178562067449,0.0173321869224,0.0161993801594,0.0136993806809,0.0134591246024,0.0133624058217,0.0131130144,0.0125432731584,0.0122807892039,0.011055259034,0.011055259034,0.0108880344778,0.00967406202108,0.00925707165152,0.00877955462784,0.0084856627509,0.00806567631662,0.00801903102547,0.00800548028201,0.00769994547591,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00700470944867,0.00639211945236,0.00597295444459,0.00597295444459,0.00585166178644,0.00566414510831,0.00556785101071,0.0052926284261,0.00519023369998,0.00455954391509,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00380151346326,0.00361353135668,0.00361353135668,0.00276877917349,0.00262401113287,0.00262401113287,0.0022956347093,0.0022956347093"

The ambiance is very nice and the air conditioning is superb but the kitchen staff prepared and made the food too fast. We had two tables and the first dish came out as expected, our appetizer the regular jellyfish, beef, pork, cured meat with pickled vegetables), then our next dish was lobster.We thought that was odd but sure, why not? Lobster is usually dish #5 and it came out as #2. Then, our fish came out as dish #3 which was supposed to be dish #6 came out. Fish should never be eaten cold, it should always be eaten hot-warm. When we tooka bite, it was nearing warm-cold which meant the fish had been prepared and was likely sitting in the kitchen before being brought out. Then, then square fried tofu came out which was supposed to be dish #2. When all of us grabbed one, 10 minutes later the sauce came...too late. Sheesh, talk about timing. Our entrees were all out of sync and the dishes did not come out one by one, it came out 2 at once or even 3 at once. Least to say, we were not pleased by the out of sync orders. We're not paying chump change here, we're paying a good premium and expect premium service. Lake Pavillion manager, step up your game. Your parking lot is way too small, we parked in Guam -- at least get the food right. Just disappointed at how service went last night. Other than that, food was good but we've had better.

There are many unique dishes on the menu that i had just never heard of before and looks like seafood is its specialty. Let's talk about dim sum first. They have all the standard stuff such as Shao Mai, egg custard,which are all very yummy.  But they also have unique dishes that I never had in other places nor know the the names in English; :) So far, one of my favorites has been the jelly cakes, :) but most other things were really yummy too. I also like their tea, which seems to be better quality than other restaurants. This is now the must go dim sum place for our families. For dinner, I've been here three times. The most recent one was for mother's day. Knowing that the restaurant scene on mother's day is always so crazy, my sister in-law made the reservation weeks in advance. Our reservation was at 6m Sunday evening and we were seated at 6pm sharp. we had selected a pre-fixe dinner menu with various type of dishes including walnut shrimps, fried flounder, steak etc. The food was served righ away. I must say that I was so nicely surprise how tender and juicy the steak was, which I didn't expect form a Chinese restaurant. And everything else was just tasty. My entire family had enjoyed the dinner very  much and we all had a great time.  One very unique thing about this place is the setting and layout. I love the VIP rooms and that's where we had the mother's day dinner. Its just a perfect place for friends and families gathering and it made the entire dining experience just extremely pleasant. I see most people complained about services. I don't know if we've been lucky or we focus more on the food. :) Of all these times we dined here, we haven't had any bad experience with services. Again, we just keep coming back for the food. Overall,  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice Chinese restaurant for dimsum and dinner with great food.",5.0 star rating,"Staten Island, NY",3,0,0.5,16.7000007629,"surprise,menu,restaurant,some,comments,specialty,restaurant,place,families,food selection,jelly cakes,Chinese,friends,dishes,grand opening,egg custard,dishes,tea,food.,setting,sum,places,restaurants,place,stuff,dinner,families,times,in-law,food,mother,mother,reservation,quality,restaurant scene,one,anyone,dishes,reservation,sister,steak,place,names,favorites,dinner,families,advance,steak,fried flounder,type,Shao Mai,mother,dinner menu,dining experience,friends,services,restaurant,VIP rooms,people,food,dinner,times,place,English,family,experience,services,walnut shrimps,things,dimsum,restaurant,place,dinner,time,everything,layout","7,7,2,7,5,7,2,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,4,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7","0.18026201427,0.154500484467,0.056026943028,0.037282500416,0.037282500416,0.0343873314559,0.0317434482276,0.0275375824422,0.0239308364689,0.0221577044576,0.0221290569752,0.0207420978695,0.0202430151403,0.020185476169,0.0177225954831,0.0160119906068,0.014453003183,0.012381230481,0.0102433664724,0.00786834396422,0.00768006499857,0.00683066807687,0.00681139575318,0.00680318102241,0.00670739589259,0.00645941263065,0.0060897609219,0.00608305400237,0.0060711898841,0.00588541384786,0.00564635917544,0.00564106181264,0.00560198957101,0.00552191352472,0.00549842882901,0.00536591326818,0.0053009246476,0.00515366904438,0.00513111520559,0.0047229770571,0.00469636404887,0.00460919877514,0.00452151848003,0.00451477570459,0.00438343593851,0.00412555225194,0.00410848530009,0.00410153856501,0.00410153856501,0.00410153856501,0.00397243071347,0.00383526063524,0.00375438993797,0.0034864123445,0.0034864123445,0.00348453200422,0.00318364636041,0.00317032937892,0.00304866209626,0.00302593619563,0.00302593619563,0.00285212788731,0.00280458875932,0.00267709931359,0.00255304807797,0.00241011986509,0.00241011986509,0.00240839133039,0.00223528803326,0.00210657482967,0.00202829297632,0.00202433206141,0.00190094741993,0.00181288376916,0.00160157145001,0.00133930693846"

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,5979,"One of the worst dim sum place and Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. And here's why:1) Food does not taste fresh. I was here for dim sum twice(giving it a second chance) and something is wrong with their meats. Shrimps in shrimp dumplings and pork in soup pork buns taste like it's been in the fridge for weeks...I was here for a wedding to try their actual food and it's as worst as it gets. Food is too salty and once again tasting stale...2) Service is horrible. The dim sum cart ladies aggressively hands you the dim sums even when you say NO. I mean I don't want it! Stop shoving it in my face! I asked the waiters 2 times to refill my tea and they never came back.3) This place is super crowded when it first opened up because it's new and tons of people want to try it out, but the hype is now over so it's not as crowded as it use to be.4) My friend had his wedding here and the area they rented out to him doesn't even have a dance floor. Everyone was just dancing around next to their tables...5) They have valet parking out back. Probably have 30-40 spots.6) Very Pricey! Definitely not worth your time or money.I would not recommend this place to ANYONE!! Only if Yelp allowed me to give 0 stars out of 5.

I live on Long Island and this place was in flush so it was a 40-50 minute drive. Parking was extremely difficult and the wait time was 30 minutes. Also the place was packed. We shared a table with two other families which made it awkward. The people serving the food did not speak any English which it difficult to say what we want. Our plates and cups were very dirty. The first thing that we ordered was chicken and it was very soggy and cold. The dumpling and calamari were okay. And the rest of the food that we ordered was bad.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,55,"For those who are native to Queens, a lot of people will remember this as the old Palace Diner, it was so visible driving by on the LIE. Enough of the nostalgia, now it's a Chinese restaurant lol It's a large restaurant that has a OK sized parking lot but this lot is always insanely packed, so packed that you are better off finding street parking or meter parking. I have been here a few times but only for dim sum and I am pretty happy with everything I have had. I don't speak Chinese so phonetic or English it is.The food:Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll- this will always be my fav dish because I love it and it makes me think of my dad. The crepe is nicely made, it's neither too thick nor too thin and the shrimp inside is prepared well.Pie Qhat- these are steamed spare ribs and these were excellent. I would say these are one of the best versions I have had. There were so tender, juicy and had nice fat content.Chicken Feet- The chicken feet were prepared well and then they give a ton of boiled peanuts. I thought this dish was good.Pork Shumai- these were really good. The pork they used wasn't finely minced like other places, it was more like pork chunks that was held together with the wrapper. I really enjoyed these. Don tot- Egg tarts. I really liked the version here. I like texture and the shell was super crispy and the filling was nice and rich. Xiao Long Bao- Soup Dumplings. I was kinda surprised to see these here since I don't think of these as Dim Sum items but these were respectable. I thought the dough was nice and the filling was good. I would get them again.Fish Balls- I thought these were good, they are kinda a staple Dim Sum dish and they were made well. The fish balls were tender and had a nice mild flavor.Law Bock Gow- Turnip cake- This is not an exciting dish but I like it when it is not greasy.

The other places I go to are Northern Manor in Little Neck or East Ocean in Forest Hills depending on what time it is. I think Lake Pavilion is the best out of the 3. The other 2 are good for satisfying a craving but Lake Pavilion always hits the spot and leaves me the most satisfied.I've been to Lake Pavilion with 2 people, 4 people, and 7 people and each time the place has been quick to seat you and the food has been hot and fresh. The dishes we order are: shrimp dumplings (ha gao), sui mai, spare ribs (pai guat), beef short ribs, shrimp rice rolls (ha churn), bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed peppers, sticky rice, and tripe.The food has been delicious every time. Last time we branched out and tried the roast duck, congee, and beef rice rolls as well. Everyone was very happy with the food. I love that Lake Pavilion is such a large location. I never waited more than 5 or 10 minutes. The carts begin to slow down and the place begins to really clean and close up around 2:45. If you go with a large group they give you multiple tea pots and come often to change your plates. Sometimes it's difficult to communicate what you want due to the language barrier (not everyone speaks English very well) but the workers all are very friendly and ready to help you get whatever you need.

The place is enormous and set up like a banquet hall. They have several private rooms, and an huge main seating area with a stage. The Food:We had several dishes including noodles with vegetables, crab salad with eggwhites, braised pork, Peking duck, and an interesting shrimp dish. I'll call particular attention to the Peking duck and shrimp dishes since they were in my opinion far and away the best of the bunch. Peking Duck - an entire duck fried up Peking style. The skin is removed from the duck when crispy and placed with vegetables into steamed buns. The duck is then cut up into manageable cubes and distributed to the party. Everything tasted fantastic. The meat itself was very greasy and rich, and the skin was very crispy and had an almost sweetness to it that went great with the steamed buns. Fried Milk w/ Shrimp - I'm not entirely sure what this dish was, but my Chinese coworkers described it as fried milk. Fried almost sweet croquettes of milk with a creamy yellow sauce and large shrimp pieces on top. Again, everything was delicious. Now I know sweet things with shrimp may not seem all that appetizing, but this is a dish you need to try to believe. Will definitely be on the lookout for this at other Chinese restaurants. Service was very good, the waiters always made sure we had enough water and clean napkins. The portions were all extremely generous. I'm not a particularly big eater, but in our party there were quite a few and they were unable to finish.

Who wants to make the treacherous journey into Main Street central flushing for dimsum or chinese dinner food when you can hop on and off from the highway, eat, and GTFO?Over the years I am failing to see the outstanding-ness of one dimsum joint over the other because I always go home and 2-3 hours later have 50% chance of #3. Jade asian restaurant and ocean jewel (probably not called this anymore, it's across from flushing mall), are my top choices but honestly... It's all becoming the same. Consistency is the best. Ocean jewel definitely more unique dishes (but $$), but this place is a solid choice for dimsum. Jade asian, I tend to get more food poisoning. Worthy to note, I enjoyed the coconut mochi with peanut/sugar inside. Leaf wrapped rice (Jang jiu gai) is tasty. All else- standard not bad *thumbs up*! Recommend. Plus it's cheap. Dinner.... I like dinner here. I LOVEEEEE the Alaskan snow crab here. Mmm that sauce! I also enjoy the snails, sauce is amazing. Walnut shrimp is delicious. Love the lobster udon noodles, altho very gingery. I eat the fried rice a lot, it's tasty here with raisins. Sea cucumber taste like nothing, so does shark fin soup. Btw think that's totally banned now so it's all ""fake"".

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4962,"Came here at the request of my in-laws who wanted to try it out.  I was dubious since fellow Yelpers had really not given this place high marks for what is standard Cantonese fare.  We arrived at peak time, Saturday night at 7 pm and the restaurant was full but with no wait time for a table for 8.  I usually keep my reviews fairly short but on rare occasions, an experience warrants much more than that.  This Cantonese seafood restaurant sits in the shell of the old Palace Diner and the renovation work was well done, if not unoriginal.  First let's get to the good.  Place was clean for a Chinese seafood restaurant, servers were attentive and polite.  Plates changed regularly and without request.  And that's all the good.  Now the bad.Parking is a travesty here.  The lot in the back for customers can probably house enough cars for a third of the restaurant's volume.  To make matters worse, there is little available street parking since most meters are taken and the rest is taken by occupants of the residential homes in the adjoining streets.  No municipal or private lots available nearby but if you're willing to park on the side of the Long Island Expressway service road and walk a long block or two, parking might be easier to find.  To think that anyone would go to this much trouble to eat here however is doubtful and if you do, you need to question your sanity or how much you had to drink before coming here.The food.....what can I say?  First, let's be clear.  It wasn't the worst Cantonese fare I've had by a long stretch of the imagination.  So why the horrible review?  Simply because the owner's here are a bunch of money grubbing cheapskates.  Our one half of a crispy chicken had less chicken on the plate than a 3 piece meal at KFC.  Seriously.  And they  had the balls to charge $12.95 for it.  Oh, and it was dry and the skin soggy.  OK, that wasn't a winner, but hey I'm an optimist.  Ordered twin lobsters in ginger and scallion sauce, a Cantonese staple.  The lobsters were TINY and the pieces so scarce that they didn't even need to stack pieces on top of one another.  There was enough space on the plate for each to inhabit its own space.  It was also kind of bland, which was terribly disappointing when they charged $42.95 for it.  My go to spot for Cantonese in Flushing, Mellie's on Northern, charges around $30, has much more meat, and tastes great.  WTF is all I can say.  Now we move onto the sweet and sour pork ribs.  Sauce was decent.  Problem was that we ordered chicken and not pork ribs.  I'm fluent in Cantonese and the server was clear on our order since she double checked before putting it in.  Lots of bones and a heavy hand with the corn starch didn't help.  What ticked me off was that the server tried to convince me to let them plate it on a regular plate rather than in a hollowed out pineapple in an effort to skimp on the cost.  Seriously, if you're going to charge me $15.95 for sweet and sour turd, the least you can do is spend the money to make it pretty.  I told her I expected our meal in the pineapple as shown.  Oh and by the way, a small order from your local takeout joint was larger.  She also managed to miss my order of Peking pork chops but perhaps that was a blessing in disguise.Finally, the so-called Peking duck.  What a disgrace.  This duck must have been swimming in the ocean when they caught it because it was salty as s^&*(.....all the way down to the bones.  Also, they don't serve Peking duck.  They serve roast duck in a traditional Peking duck bun.  IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.  Those in the know, know that Peking duck has crispy skin, little to no fat due to the unique cooking process and should be lightly seasoned.   This was roast duck with soy sauce on a bun.  I'm insulted.  The duck was fatty, salty and the skin mushy.  WTF WTF WTF.  At least the bun was tasty with the hoisin sauce.  We also had fried rice but it wasn't anything special.  In summation, portions are REALLY SMALL here and they can't justify that with the prices they charge.  There are plenty of other similar and BETTER restaurants in Flushing which charge a reasonable price for much better and more food.  To give you an idea, the portions were all about a third smaller than other similar restaurants like East, Corner 28, Mellie's and Ocean Jewels but charge about 20-30% more.  Our tab for twin lobsters, half a chicken, fried rice, sweet and sour pork, half a duck, and snow pea shoots (which tasted the best by far) was $160 before tip.  This same meal probably runs about $120 in any other restaurant.  And we all left hungry since the portions were so much smaller.  Never going back, this place is a joke.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,32.4000015259,"optimist,request,Cantonese,in-laws,restaurant,seafood restaurant,renovation

Note to anyone - don't come during this day unless you want to wait a REALLY LONG TIME to eat. We waited for about 1 hr for a table. This place is really dim sum style seating. So they cater towards getting the most people in when they can, which means tables of 4 and 2 get in faster. Once we got seated, they took forever to take our order so we had to flag down the waiter, who ended up not doing anything. Once we flagged down another waiter he took our order. Ended up waiting over 30 minutes before even getting our first dish. 1 dish got ""sold out"" so we scratched it from our order and another dish we would have to wait a long time so we never ordered it. But seeing as how we waited for the rest of our food for so long, we could have ordered it.They have really large portions.

The atmosphere is lively so it good for breakfast and lunch which is characteristic of dim sum restaurants.The food is mediocre for a dim sum place in New York as the beef tripe is too chewy and the pork skin is watery and slippery in texture. Among the pork skins are the white radishes that don't taste ideal. The chicken feet has the traditionally sweet flavor but it's just missing something. The shrimp rolls are the only redeeming item but even then my mouth is left with a thirst like no other. I ordered vegetables to cleanse my palette but they are too tough and oily. In the parts that aren't tough they are a bit chewy. Overall the quality of the food is acceptable but I would prefer some place in flushing more. I must edit my review due to their amazing dinner. We ordered frog, fish maw soup, lobster and numerous other dishes. Most of the foods tasted pretty good and had a lighter salted flavoring. The frog is nice and crispy, the soup's thickness was a perfect start of the meal and the lobster is quite well made. Most of the other dishes were pretty good too and not too salty.

It's right off the LIE highway on exit 23. It was formally Palace Diner for a number of years. There is valet parking behind the restaurant, as well as parking in front and on the streets. Both times I've been here, the wait time has been short despite it usually being packed. As with most dim sum restaurants, expect to be potentially seated with other people at the same table. Ask for the chrysanthemum tea, which is lighter and sweeter than the usual black tea that's served in Chinese restaurants. Dim sum carts are constantly going around so you're never short of waiting for food to come. Just tell the cart ladies what you want or point to it. There is staff that occasionally comes by to change out your plate for a clean one and bring you another fresh pot of tea. Service is quick and on point. There is a separate take-out location on side of the place.Personal picks:Egg tartsCongeeDuck feetSpare ribsCha siu cherngChive shrimp dumplingSteam custard bun",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,5.19999980927,"location,sum,location,area,downtown,Flushing,chrysanthemum tea,black tea,valet parking,restaurant,LIE highway,exit,number,carts,dim sum restaurants,parking,restaurants,sum,times,streets,front,people,table,Palace Diner,tea,Service,location,one,plate,point,pot,Chinese,side,picks,custard bun,shrimp,staff,food,dumplingSteam,Egg tartsCongeeDuck feetSpare ribsCha siu cherngChive,cart ladies","2,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,1,7,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,2,1","0.378021508455,0.0812724381685,0.0812724381685,0.0651205927134,0.0651205927134,0.0389762148261,0.0289536193013,0.0233917161822,0.0167121719569,0.0150105701759,0.0120629174635,0.0120629174635,0.0120013309643,0.0117853125557,0.0100982096046,0.00923465006053,0.00922533124685,0.00920977443457,0.00920864194632,0.00808239076287,0.00808239076287,0.00804105587304,0.00804105587304,0.00758111383766,0.00686606112868,0.00668458361179,0.00581110967323,0.00546580180526,0.00546580180526,0.0054592108354,0.00469534890726,0.00435212161392,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00293829874136,0.00240576011129,0.00223647453822,0.00223647453822,0.00170585711021"

She thought the place was beautiful (it's completely insane looking- the brightest most insane inside of a restaurant I've seen in a very long time...maybe ever. It looks like someone on LSD got the brightest crayons & furnishings from a 93 year old Alice in Wonderland fan). Anyhow the place is large and clean. There is a back room that really does look quite nice with wooden floors...much better taste!For those who do not speak the language of the staff, you'll be able to get through ordering and eating, but it may take some assistance. One of the servers literally looked at us like a deer in headlights (maybe more like a cat). He went to get someone else who was able to help a bit. They were all very nice, with the exception of the folks in the parking lot who told us it was ""free parking but you have to give a $2 tip"" Huh, what? How is that free, then? Isn't the patron supposed to decide that. Anyways, everyone else was nice. The food is solid and you get lots. We had a chicken dish and a beef dish. Both were good and maybe about 2 or 3 bucks high, but nevertheless quite tasty. I would definitely return. This is definitely a good place for large parties and families.

Dear Manager, was it really worth arguing with your customers over $30 tip when they're already spending $1700? Could you not pull your customer aside to discuss this instead of accusing him in front of all his guests that he underpaid? Lastly, please make sure your calculations are right before accusing others. As for the food, it would've gotten 3 stars. Dishes are hit or miss. Only thing I remembered being good was the abalone.

The food, service, and overall experience was alright.Food - Chicken, duck, shrimp w/ mayo sauce and walnuts, and more.Chicken - Pretty good. It wasn't salty and they did not over cook it.Peking duck - We had the peking duck served with the bun and I think scallions. Our colleague from Atlanta calls it ""chinese taco's"". It was pretty good but I wished it was served at a warmer temperature.Shrimp w/ mayo sauce - This is probably one of my favorite dishes in general. I love shrimp and I love mayo. What I didn't like about the one they made here, it was too yellow looking and the way the dish was presented looked unflattering. Usually at other restaurants, they serve it with the plate rimmed with brocoli or some places add shrimp chips just to give the dish some color and a nicer presentation. The shrimp didn't taste bad but I've had better.As for the rest, we ordered some vegetable that was cooked really well. We also ordered Chow Fun? I dunno what they call some of these dishes in english. But for the rest, they were all okay.Drinks - Tsingtao, Heineken, and Budweiser, tea, Coke, Sprite, House wine, and since it's Chinese New Year, they had a table right by the entrance with a display of priced wine, whiskey, and cognac bottles. I'm not even sure if they have a license for that. If I'm not mistaken, I think in New York, beer and wine license is under 1 license and liquor license is separate. Service - Excellent but towards the end, they were kinda pushing us to leave. The restaurant wasn't full or anything and since it was a company dinner, we wanted to sit and chit chat for a bit but the servers kept coming and asking us if we're done and trying to take away our plates while some of us were still eating.Verdict - Not a bad place at all despite the service towards the end of our evening. The food came out in good timing. I enjoyed the portions except for the shrimp w/ mayo sauce. There were barely any walnuts in that dish. Other than that, I really might just come back again some day with my family. They have their own parking lot in the back and meter parking right out front.

It's incredibly packed and loud, but the dim sum has never been disappointing. I like the variety of dim sum and the freshness of it all. If I had to rate, it would be 4.5/5 for dim sum and the deduction is due to the noise level and crowdedness.On to the dinner side: one of my favorite places for dinner is at Lake Pavilion. I used to frequent Tung Yi Fung in Flushing, but my family now prefers the closer Lake Pavilion. I love their veggies (watercress with garlic and tofu/mushroom dish), seafood selection (prawns and fish that I never know the English name to), and salmon fried rice.

Whenever I come here, I am not the one who orders so I won't be able to list the names and prices. However pictures are as good as words. Crab with Sticky Rice - The crab tasted fresh but it was a mistake to stir fry the rice with the crab. The rice was still a bit hard and bland but the real problem was the amount of crab shells bits mixed in with the rice. You were almost waiting for an unpleasant crunch in each bite. (6/10)Braised Geese with Bean Curd Skin - A very rich and saucy dish. The bean curd skin does a great job in soaking the flavors. But for a $20+ dish, you would expect more meat than just geese necks and offals... (6/10)Stir Fried Bean Sprouts - The vegetables here are always the best, especially the bean sprouts. They were tender and crispy and the clean flavor balances the other salty dishes. (9/10)One dish worth mentioning is the famous ""Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"" advertised on posters all over the walls of the restaurant. This Chinese delicacy is one of the most expensive soups in the world and comprises of many exotic ingredients like shark fin, abalone, sea cucumber, ginseng, dried everything, etc. Being so, this soup is costs over $1000.

And the food was quite good and delicious. I asked my parents if they had a dim sum special pricing for the weekdays here and they do NOT. I said, why are so many people here paying regular price for dim sum on weekends when Flushing had so many other choices. I saw the answer. Restaurant decor is up to date and CLEAN.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,100945,"Always knew this location as Palace Diner for more than 10 years. Saying that, I wish it was still that place.Decided to check this restaurant out with my family for my mother's birthday, and it wasn't a good one. First the parking. You have to pay a $2 tip for the ""valets"". They offered to park our car,  which my father refused and parked himself but he still had to pay the tip. Not a good start.Going into the restaurant the first thing we noticed was that the place was very noisy and crowded. We were then led to our table and as soon as we sat down we were bombarded with ladies and their dim sum carts. The lady was offering and we took what seemed good, which was some dumplings and shrimp siomai. They tasted no different from other similar restaurants. What bothered us was that these carts would not leave us alone, even if we said ""no thank you"". And they did not attempt to speak a little English when they could clearly see that we don't speak Chinese. We had to resort to sign language, waving them away.It also took forever for a waiter to come by and serve us. We had to flag one down and get their attention to order. When he finally arrived he gave us only one menu for all four of us. Looking at the prices they seemed pretty expensive for dishes that you would normally find in a Chinese take out place. We ordered chicken & broccoli, seafood platter, and roast duck.We waited a good 30 minutes before the food came. Now during that wait those cart ladies were at us again. Wouldn't leave us alone. One lady actually took one of the plates and placed it on our table without asking us. Very rude. The dishes we ordered were just bland as they can be, in taste and presentation. The portions did not match the prices either. The Chinese take out spot we usually go to that's across the street from here are cheaper, gave bigger portions, and actually tasted better.In the end we paid about $60 for what is probably the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. Staff were disrespectful (especially those cart ladies) and their appearances were not up to standard.

We were expecting a once in a life time meal, given the price tag. I even skipped lunch, anticipating a heavy and delicious traditional Chinese banquet style meal. Oh boy, was I disappointed. We booked a private room, which was $100 more, so we can have more privacy. But the minute I walked into the room, I knew something was wrong. The room was extremely hot, without proper ventilation. Then when the food came, everything went downhill...EVERY single dishes was either too salty, greasy or taste like shxt.

Waiters are definitely hit or miss.Definitely get there around 10am on the weekends, or else you'll be waiting awhile for your table.There was also some miscommunication about the dim sum i ordered. I asked for 2 har gow and 1 siu mai. They gave me the two har gow on top of each other, assuming it was the same thing. We finished the first har gow, lifted the bamboo steamer and realized that under there was another siu mai. So i told a waitress...she looked at me clueless, then brought over a manager, who was obviously doubting me. Seriously, would i waste time arguing about an effin dim sum?! So he canceled an order of siu mai and i said he should have canceled an order of hargow since i only got one of them. He then got frustrated and asked me which dim sum auntie served me...he eventually brought her over and she goes i remember! You ordered two har gow and 1 siu mai! I said I know, but i got two siu mai and 1 har gow! She goes no you didnt. (Yes, apparently I am now blind and do not know what is blantantly right in front of me?) So i said there was a siu mai under that hargow she gave me...and then she was like OHHHHHHHHHHHH. That's when the manager took back the siu mai, canceled the one har gow on the bill and realized they were wrong. And an apology? Yeah right, not today buddy....I was most unhappy about the fact that they rushed us out when we were leaving. We just got up to leave and put on our jackets, and the waiters immediately came over to clear our table, even if it meant they were bumping into us (we had 5 kids with us too) so that was very rude.

Although the language barrier is partially there, our love for food is our mutual language.Entering Lake Pavilion at 1:00pm on Sunday afternoon, I observed a massive, banquet sized dining room that was empty minus two tables which sat men and women dressed in white at one and men and women in black at the other.As the light went on in my head that food service for lunch was a thing of the past and the people (in black and white) eating were staffers, my neighbor talked to management and we were seated. As I do not know the native tongue nor able to read emotions, I think it was not a major problem. Unfortunately I can not tell you exactly what the four items we were served by name, as my neighbor never looked at the menu, rather he discussed with the waiter what was available and in ten minutes the food was served. One Roast Pork dish, succulent meat with a beautifully crusted outside portion. The fried tofu was sauced and served with a deep green leafy vegetable, similar to escarole. The fried fish, similar to flounder in texture flaky, light and very tasty followed by a chicken curry dish. Each dish was so very unique and authentic in comparison to the small store front Chinese food locations in my area and the surrounding areas. I felt compelled to purchase extra to take home, which I did..If you read the seafood menu portion of their menu, some of the more unusual but interesting items are Sauteed, Stewed or Steamed Frogs, Abalone & Preserved Seafood portion lists Braised Sea Cucumber in Oyster Sauce and a full listing of Shark's Fin offerings.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,451,"It's time for an update!After the fire, they renovated the restaurant and changed their name to New Lake Pavilion. The restaurant is still very spacious with a good amount of tables. Comfortable setting and seating combined.I must say the food served at night is very good, especially the 1st dish Lobster - extremely fresh - so it was the STAR of the night! The Peking Pork Chops were crispy but did not have enough sour taste to it and sauce covered up. The crispy tofu dish was on point. The veggies were made to perfection. In addition, we ordered the 5th dish, Peking Duck, and it was overly cooked as if they reheated it because the skin was very dark-colored and the meat was semi-dried. The waiter sliced up the duck for us, which was appreciated, but not sure if he cut off all the meat for us. Sadly to say, it was the WORST dish of the night! The husband was craving for a GOOD PEKING DUCK AND WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! In the beginning of dinner, they serve these good tasting sour radish!

They probably make most of their money on dim sum and banquet patrons, so service suffers if you're not in those categories. I can only speak to the dim sum side of things, as I've never gone here for anything else. I can tell you, the quality of the dim sum is consistently good, in my opinion generally better than Asian Jewels for example. If you're familiar with Jade Asian, I'd say it's about on par, but maybe slightly better than that even. Very affordable. One caveat: there have been a couple occasions where the shrimp dumplings (虾饺, har gow) had wrappers that just fell apart. Take that for what its worth, since a lot of people judge a dim sum place by that specific dish. Like I said though, the rest of it is solid.

It was still jammed pack but surprisingly we got seated pretty quickly. The carts came rolling by our table immediately with the typical dim sum varieties: steamed pork buns, siu mai, and churn funs. Har gows always seem to make a late appearance but we still got it towards the end. But the highlight, as I mentioned earlier, was the lion dance. I heard the drums and gongs outside of the restaurant and typically, they usually just do a little dance outside of a business establishment. But no, this was a full out performance and they pretty much went to greet each and every table in the restaurant.  It was quite a spectacle.  Thanks for the entertainment! As far as dim sum goes, this place isn't bad. It's cleaner and more organized than most of other establishments within the vicinity.  I think what sets them apart from other dim sums in Flushing is their décor and service.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,194003,"According to the thesaurus, there are 43 synonyms for ok. You can add Lake Pavilion to the list because for traditional Chinese cuisine in a banquet setting, Lake Pavilion was acceptable, average, common, fair, moderate, okay, standard, adequate, all right, copacetic, decent, fairish, goodish, and hunky-dory.My wife and I joined a few friends from China for dinner at Lake Pavilion. Luckily, the food didn't distract from the conversation and stories. We started with some Hot & Sour Soup and then a stream of items to share including Steamed Whole Fish, Chinese White Broccoli, Beef Steak and Waffle Fries, and Fried Rice. Sweet Red Bean Dessert Soup and Fresh Orange Slices closed the meal, but not the banter.Lake Pavilion is about a mile from the Flushing train station if you are walking, but the large (and packed) parking lot makes it a convenient choice next to the highway.

The valet parking out back is helpful if you don't mind waiting in a line of cars that wrap around the block just to get in. Flushing seems to attract the most horrible drivers, so beware. Once you get in, waiting for a table after spending 30 minutes parking will be your next fun task. The front area gets so crowded that it is literally a sea of bodies pressed together as steaming hot plates of food pass by (dangerously close to your head). Crowd control doesn't seem to be a priority for the management, they kind of just ignore it. Remember to bring your breath mints, as you will be breathing about 4 inches away from a stranger's face. When you finally do get a table, don't expect too much in terms of good service from the overworked wait staff. That being said, their dim sum is arguably the best in the Flushing. I've been frequenting dim sum joints in the area since I was a little kid, and this place is delicious. I've also had many traditional Chinese banquets here with family and their dishes are really great. Not too salty or greasy. Wouldn't recommend the Peking duck though.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,100945,"Always knew this location as Palace Diner for more than 10 years. Saying that, I wish it was still that place.Decided to check this restaurant out with my family for my mother's birthday, and it wasn't a good one. First the parking. You have to pay a $2 tip for the ""valets"". They offered to park our car,  which my father refused and parked himself but he still had to pay the tip. Not a good start.Going into the restaurant the first thing we noticed was that the place was very noisy and crowded. We were then led to our table and as soon as we sat down we were bombarded with ladies and their dim sum carts. The lady was offering and we took what seemed good, which was some dumplings and shrimp siomai. They tasted no different from other similar restaurants. What bothered us was that these carts would not leave us alone, even if we said ""no thank you"". And they did not attempt to speak a little English when they could clearly see that we don't speak Chinese. We had to resort to sign language, waving them away.It also took forever for a waiter to come by and serve us. We had to flag one down and get their attention to order. When he finally arrived he gave us only one menu for all four of us. Looking at the prices they seemed pretty expensive for dishes that you would normally find in a Chinese take out place. We ordered chicken & broccoli, seafood platter, and roast duck.We waited a good 30 minutes before the food came. Now during that wait those cart ladies were at us again. Wouldn't leave us alone. One lady actually took one of the plates and placed it on our table without asking us. Very rude. The dishes we ordered were just bland as they can be, in taste and presentation. The portions did not match the prices either. The Chinese take out spot we usually go to that's across the street from here are cheaper, gave bigger portions, and actually tasted better.In the end we paid about $60 for what is probably the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. Staff were disrespectful (especially those cart ladies) and their appearances were not up to standard.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,58496,"Came here with the family for Chinese New Years a few days ago. We already had reservations set so seating wasn't a problem. The restaurant however was packed way beyond capacity. Already from the start I knew the management was a mess. I had overheard waiters discussing how they overbooked the restaurant and turned away families who had reservations because other parties were already there and management didn't want to have an empty table. That alone is an embarrassment to the ethics of a restaurant.I understand it's the new year and its incredibly busy but this is no excuse for poor service and execution of the dishes. The food overall was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary for Chinese family style restaurants in Flushing. HOWEVER. The execution was an embarrassment. Every dish we ordered came out on an ice cold plate. I don't mean a little cold, i mean it seemed to have been left outside and sprayed down with a hose to clean. This meant all the food was instantly cold on the pass to the table. The most absurd thing was that we were told to accept it because it was CNY and its ""how it is"". Are you kidding me? Another case was when we ordered the fried tofu and vegetable stir fry, it came out without the tofu...just a plate of vegetables. Like serving steak and fries without the steak. Really?? We told the waiter that this was not right and he looked at us dumbfounded and speechless. His incompetence attracted the floor manager who came by and asked him what the problem was. After he told her, she just told him to serve it and it didn't matter. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. I looked at her in disbelief and was about to lose it before she asked him to take it back. Overall, this was by far the worst meal I've ever had in Flushing. From the food to the service to seeing the mess of a management team, I will not be wasting any future celebrations here. PS: I saw a waiter who dropped a raw fish from the bag and tried to pick it up with his hands but failed several times. He then proceeded to kick it under the service table and with those dirty hands, he grabbed a bunch of plates and cups to set the next table. really? really? come on now. can I see some decency in this ""restaurant""?",1.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,-0.300000011921,14.3000001907,"restaurant.,management,waiters,family,restaurant,Chinese New Years,restaurant,embarrassment,problem,seating,reservations,floor manager,meal,way,capacity,start,waiter,case,families,PS,waiter,embarrassment,table,management,service,reservations,execution,dishes,food,food,ethics,restaurants,table,dish,plate,thing,plate,steak,Flushing,fried tofu,vegetable,tofu,vegetables,steak,Nothing,ordinary,family style,hose,pass,stir fry,fries,incompetence,food,service,mess,celebrations,management team,bag,fish,restaurant,parties,service table,table,Chinese,plates,hands,hands,decency,times,bunch,cups,problem,FRONT,disbelief,US","7,7,1,1,2,4,2,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,4,3,6,7,2,3,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.135206669569,0.112565837801,0.0625648647547,0.0523987933993,0.0339698120952,0.0283857192844,0.0283011011779,0.0247793979943,0.0242979321629,0.0238301549107,0.0228135120124,0.02213043347,0.0220615174621,0.0211647264659,0.0198706798255,0.0197986662388,0.0187076255679,0.0156578682363,0.0134859234095,0.0134492041543,0.011492472142,0.010676885955,0.0102096954361,0.0100813163444,0.00946508161724,0.00862996652722,0.00861007068306,0.00861007068306,0.00761747360229,0.00755799561739,0.00753423664719,0.00727879581973,0.00681265303865,0.00638531893492,0.00634337682277,0.00600990606472,0.00577759835869,0.00552417337894,0.0053784949705,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525117618963,0.00506888469681,0.00506888469681,0.00506888469681,0.00504290824756,0.00503779621795,0.004598043859,0.0045945122838,0.00458505935967,0.00429255980998,0.00429255980998,0.00390430144034,0.00341590843163,0.00341590843163,0.00341421063058,0.00341421063058,0.00338782533072,0.0032721911557,0.00319581804797,0.00319581804797,0.00300112832338,0.00296918279491,0.0027018270921,0.00270053441636,0.00244993995875,0.00236375606619,0.00236262497492,0.00236262497492,0.00205089664087,0.00150050735101,0.0014996615937,0.000888051232323"

We've been at this place for dim sum and the food were ok so we decided to go there to celebrate our annual Chinese New Year's family dinner there. We pre-ordered the special set dinner (what their version of ""Buddhist jumping wall"") for $800. They did a wonderful job on the menu in describing the 10-course meal. We were expecting a once in a life time meal, given the price tag. I even skipped lunch, anticipating a heavy and delicious traditional Chinese banquet style meal. Oh boy, was I disappointed. We booked a private room, which was $100 more, so we can have more privacy. But the minute I walked into the room, I knew something was wrong. The room was extremely hot, without proper ventilation. Then when the food came, everything went downhill...EVERY single dishes was either too salty, greasy or taste like shxt. We expected more for a meal close to a grand, when you factor in taxes and gratuity. In the end, we left the place half full with empty wallets.

Within the past years, I noticed that this restaurant always comes up with new dishes and a several weeks later other major Flushing Chinese restaurants would copy and promote the same dishes on their wall.  High score for originality.-Unlike the Chinese seafood/dim sum restaurants by Roosevelt Ave., this place is more convenient for the folks who do not desire to commute into an overcrowded Flushing area.  The parking lot is a tad small, but there is street parking if you don't mind walking 1-5 min for free street parking.-But that is not to say that this restaurant is not busy.  In fact, it is always packed whenever I go.  Over the weekend, it is like waiting for a new Apple iPhone! but worth the wait.  Call ahead of time to reserve for the VIP rooms.  Their soup is excellent.",5.0 star rating,"Jamaica, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,6.90000009537,"food critic,one,restaurant,restaurant,East Coast,food menu,edge,dishes,folks,sum,places,restaurants,food,dinner,wedding,dim sum restaurants,place,dishes,West Coast,blogger,menu list,atmosphere,wall,score,originality.,seafood,street parking.,Chinese,fact,soup,Roosevelt Ave.,wait,VIP rooms,street parking,parking lot,area,iPhone,Apple,Flushing","1,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,7,4,4,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,2,2,6,3,2","0.49769115448,0.186334744096,0.0537021011114,0.0499676801264,0.0258403345942,0.023290688172,0.0133369639516,0.0125187793747,0.0108112646267,0.00873046647757,0.00797361880541,0.00721187982708,0.00717479223385,0.00695526367053,0.00695526367053,0.00611118087545,0.0059570944868,0.0048738354817,0.00472998572513,0.00468816515058,0.00467737019062,0.00467737019062,0.00426557520404,0.00425922591239,0.00425922591239,0.00425922591239,0.00399396708235,0.00329848239198,0.00317567796446,0.00268318434246,0.00252367276698,0.00219497014768,0.00219291052781,0.00214777537622,0.00170930684544,0.00139743543696,0.00130104681011,0.00130104681011,0.000827270909213"

After we asked 3 times and 10 minutes later, a floor manager finally brought some tea.Then, the waiter came to take the order. We asked what fishes they have, the waiter replied with a short list, while his eyes wondering somewhere else, very rude. After that, we ordered steamed pork sth on the menu. He straight up said, we couldn't do it. While my family was trying to figure out what else we could order to replace this dish we wanted to try. I couldn't help myself but ask this waiter what do you have and that you could make? If you don't do it why do you have it on the menu. He went ,oh it's not like we couldn't do it, but it takes more than an hour to make, then you will yell/curse at me because you waited too long. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard a waiter say! First of all, why did you say you could not make it in the first place if that's not the case, then why couldn't you explain this dish will take a long time to make, and if you did all that and we still would like to try it, why would we yell at you?? I wasn't going to spend 70 dollars on a fish dish and yet have to endure this kind of service, so we left immediately and definitely not going back and will NOT RECOMMEND anyone to go there.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,194272,"I've been here for dim sum a few times and it's nice because it is convenient to drive to and there is valet parking. It's a bit noisy as most Chinese places are. It is a bright and clean environment. The atmosphere is lively so it good for breakfast and lunch which is characteristic of dim sum restaurants.The food is mediocre for a dim sum place in New York as the beef tripe is too chewy and the pork skin is watery and slippery in texture. Among the pork skins are the white radishes that don't taste ideal. The chicken feet has the traditionally sweet flavor but it's just missing something. The shrimp rolls are the only redeeming item but even then my mouth is left with a thirst like no other. I ordered vegetables to cleanse my palette but they are too tough and oily. In the parts that aren't tough they are a bit chewy. Overall the quality of the food is acceptable but I would prefer some place in flushing more. I must edit my review due to their amazing dinner. We ordered frog, fish maw soup, lobster and numerous other dishes. Most of the foods tasted pretty good and had a lighter salted flavoring. The frog is nice and crispy, the soup's thickness was a perfect start of the meal and the lobster is quite well made. Most of the other dishes were pretty good too and not too salty. It is possible that the sodium content decreased for dinner to reduce bloating.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,165213,"Here's the gist of the reviews: go here for dim sum or if you're invited to a banquet, don't go here for anything else. They probably make most of their money on dim sum and banquet patrons, so service suffers if you're not in those categories. I can only speak to the dim sum side of things, as I've never gone here for anything else. I can tell you, the quality of the dim sum is consistently good, in my opinion generally better than Asian Jewels for example. If you're familiar with Jade Asian, I'd say it's about on par, but maybe slightly better than that even. Very affordable. One caveat: there have been a couple occasions where the shrimp dumplings (虾饺, har gow) had wrappers that just fell apart.

The parking lot required a $2 tip although advertised as free. The take out section had a separate door. I came here at 4pm to the dim sum and roast duck/pork area and proceeded to ask how much the dim sum was since they had so little left, which is completely understandable at this time of the day. The lady says $1.50 each dish but I'll sell it to you for a dollar each if you buy ten. Leftovers but it's a deal! She then gets pushy and demands that I take a certain amount of this and that but I didn't mind. She then tells me to take out two more dollars since she has some leftover fried taro balls and spring rolls. I pay her, DRIVE away only to find out that these items were NOT placed in my bag. I was going to let it go but I decided to DRIVE back 30 minutes later just to confirm. As I ask the lady, she decides this is her time of the month to yell at me saying that I did take possession of said items. She did not bother checking to see if she made a mistake, which she surely did. Sure.... I DROVE away and BACK to rip off a restaurant. Gas is +$4.25 a gallon.  Are you kidding me? It's one thing to hustle people to buy your leftovers but its another thing to steal from your customers. Honestly, it cost me $2 to learn my lesson here.

They have valet parking in the back that is pretty chaotic, but they always find you a spot, for it's about $3. It's kinda one of the better places my family chooses to dimsum in. The decor is cheesier than other places - silly angel chandeliers included.  Coming in a large group will probably land you a table on the top part (where the bride and groom typically sit during Chinese wedding banquets), but that's not too bad. You really can't get food if you get a ""private"" room. It's really hard to fetch the cart ladies, even when they come the food is already gone - so be ready to chase them if you end up in a room with only you and your family/friends in it. The wait is seriously shorter if you know someone who works here so use your guanxi skills. lol That waiting area gets ridiculous tho. The dimsum food is ok. Not mediocre - even for a master dimsum hater such as myself. I kinda like their baked pork buns (char siu bao) - which come with the ""pineapple"" top. I haven't had a bad dumpling here - but don't be that guy who gets XLB during dimsum then complains about it not being the best, because there are places for that and you are just trying to fool yourself. Do get the shrimp dumplings (har gow). I like their rice flour steamed rolls (cheung fun) too. Congee is not bad and very filling. Definitely get the turnip cakes (law bak gow) if they are still hot, and the same applies to the egg tarts, although I'm the type of person who'd stuff her face with egg tarts even if they were frozen...

Who wants to make the treacherous journey into Main Street central flushing for dimsum or chinese dinner food when you can hop on and off from the highway, eat, and GTFO?Over the years I am failing to see the outstanding-ness of one dimsum joint over the other because I always go home and 2-3 hours later have 50% chance of #3. Jade asian restaurant and ocean jewel (probably not called this anymore, it's across from flushing mall), are my top choices but honestly... It's all becoming the same. Consistency is the best. Ocean jewel definitely more unique dishes (but $$), but this place is a solid choice for dimsum. Jade asian, I tend to get more food poisoning. Worthy to note, I enjoyed the coconut mochi with peanut/sugar inside. Leaf wrapped rice (Jang jiu gai) is tasty. All else- standard not bad *thumbs up*! Recommend. Plus it's cheap. Dinner.... I like dinner here. I LOVEEEEE the Alaskan snow crab here. Mmm that sauce! I also enjoy the snails, sauce is amazing. Walnut shrimp is delicious. Love the lobster udon noodles, altho very gingery.

I would say these are one of the best versions I have had. There were so tender, juicy and had nice fat content.Chicken Feet- The chicken feet were prepared well and then they give a ton of boiled peanuts. I thought this dish was good.Pork Shumai- these were really good. The pork they used wasn't finely minced like other places, it was more like pork chunks that was held together with the wrapper. I really enjoyed these. Don tot- Egg tarts. I really liked the version here. I like texture and the shell was super crispy and the filling was nice and rich. Xiao Long Bao- Soup Dumplings. I was kinda surprised to see these here since I don't think of these as Dim Sum items but these were respectable. I thought the dough was nice and the filling was good. I would get them again.Fish Balls- I thought these were good, they are kinda a staple Dim Sum dish and they were made well. The fish balls were tender and had a nice mild flavor.Law Bock Gow- Turnip cake- This is not an exciting dish but I like it when it is not greasy. The one here wasn't too bad, the flavor of the turnip and Chinese bacon were good.Cha Siu Bao- Steamed pork buns. I thought the one here was respectable, the bun was nice and fluffy but I thought the filling was a tad sweet and a tad salty.Stewed Tripe- this is normally one of my fav dim sum items but the one here needed to be cooked more.

Because it was my first time seeing up close and personal a lion dance performance in a restaurant on CNY.  So we came here on an untraditionally late dim sum (2pm) just so we thought we could beat the crowd. It was still jammed pack but surprisingly we got seated pretty quickly. The carts came rolling by our table immediately with the typical dim sum varieties: steamed pork buns, siu mai, and churn funs. Har gows always seem to make a late appearance but we still got it towards the end. But the highlight, as I mentioned earlier, was the lion dance. I heard the drums and gongs outside of the restaurant and typically, they usually just do a little dance outside of a business establishment. But no, this was a full out performance and they pretty much went to greet each and every table in the restaurant.  It was quite a spectacle.  Thanks for the entertainment! As far as dim sum goes, this place isn't bad. It's cleaner and more organized than most of other establishments within the vicinity.  I think what sets them apart from other dim sums in Flushing is their décor and service.

To our surprise, the portion was missing about 1/4 of the crab legs and the creamy sections of the crab she'll were missing.  We know this because we order this same dish just several weeks ago and had a relative who knew one of the owners (unfortunately he wasn't present this evening). We spoke to the waiter that serviced our table and asked him why were the contents of the head missing and he said it was cooked within the dish.

Although, it's crowded .. the wait for a table isn't that long if you don't mind sharing a table. For me, it is kind of awkward and weird.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4962,"Came here at the request of my in-laws who wanted to try it out.  I was dubious since fellow Yelpers had really not given this place high marks for what is standard Cantonese fare.  We arrived at peak time, Saturday night at 7 pm and the restaurant was full but with no wait time for a table for 8.  I usually keep my reviews fairly short but on rare occasions, an experience warrants much more than that.  This Cantonese seafood restaurant sits in the shell of the old Palace Diner and the renovation work was well done, if not unoriginal.  First let's get to the good.  Place was clean for a Chinese seafood restaurant, servers were attentive and polite.  Plates changed regularly and without request.  And that's all the good.  Now the bad.Parking is a travesty here.  The lot in the back for customers can probably house enough cars for a third of the restaurant's volume.  To make matters worse, there is little available street parking since most meters are taken and the rest is taken by occupants of the residential homes in the adjoining streets.  No municipal or private lots available nearby but if you're willing to park on the side of the Long Island Expressway service road and walk a long block or two, parking might be easier to find.  To think that anyone would go to this much trouble to eat here however is doubtful and if you do, you need to question your sanity or how much you had to drink before coming here.The food.....what can I say?  First, let's be clear.  It wasn't the worst Cantonese fare I've had by a long stretch of the imagination.  So why the horrible review?  Simply because the owner's here are a bunch of money grubbing cheapskates.  Our one half of a crispy chicken had less chicken on the plate than a 3 piece meal at KFC.  Seriously.  And they  had the balls to charge $12.95 for it.  Oh, and it was dry and the skin soggy.  OK, that wasn't a winner, but hey I'm an optimist.  Ordered twin lobsters in ginger and scallion sauce, a Cantonese staple.  The lobsters were TINY and the pieces so scarce that they didn't even need to stack pieces on top of one another.  There was enough space on the plate for each to inhabit its own space.  It was also kind of bland, which was terribly disappointing when they charged $42.95 for it.  My go to spot for Cantonese in Flushing, Mellie's on Northern, charges around $30, has much more meat, and tastes great.  WTF is all I can say.  Now we move onto the sweet and sour pork ribs.  Sauce was decent.  Problem was that we ordered chicken and not pork ribs.  I'm fluent in Cantonese and the server was clear on our order since she double checked before putting it in.  Lots of bones and a heavy hand with the corn starch didn't help.  What ticked me off was that the server tried to convince me to let them plate it on a regular plate rather than in a hollowed out pineapple in an effort to skimp on the cost.  Seriously, if you're going to charge me $15.95 for sweet and sour turd, the least you can do is spend the money to make it pretty.  I told her I expected our meal in the pineapple as shown.  Oh and by the way, a small order from your local takeout joint was larger.  She also managed to miss my order of Peking pork chops but perhaps that was a blessing in disguise.Finally, the so-called Peking duck.  What a disgrace.  This duck must have been swimming in the ocean when they caught it because it was salty as s^&*(.....all the way down to the bones.  Also, they don't serve Peking duck.  They serve roast duck in a traditional Peking duck bun.  IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.  Those in the know, know that Peking duck has crispy skin, little to no fat due to the unique cooking process and should be lightly seasoned.   This was roast duck with soy sauce on a bun.  I'm insulted.  The duck was fatty, salty and the skin mushy.  WTF WTF WTF.  At least the bun was tasty with the hoisin sauce.  We also had fried rice but it wasn't anything special.  In summation, portions are REALLY SMALL here and they can't justify that with the prices they charge.  There are plenty of other similar and BETTER restaurants in Flushing which charge a reasonable price for much better and more food.  To give you an idea, the portions were all about a third smaller than other similar restaurants like East, Corner 28, Mellie's and Ocean Jewels but charge about 20-30% more.  Our tab for twin lobsters, half a chicken, fried rice, sweet and sour pork, half a duck, and snow pea shoots (which tasted the best by far) was $160 before tip.  This same meal probably runs about $120 in any other restaurant.  And we all left hungry since the portions were so much smaller.  Never going back, this place is a joke.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,32.4000015259,"optimist,request,Cantonese,in-laws,restaurant,seafood restaurant,renovation

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,3760,"Our company invited us here for a free dinner so why not. It's a easy place to get to, it's literally right off the Long Island Expressway. The food, service, and overall experience was alright.Food - Chicken, duck, shrimp w/ mayo sauce and walnuts, and more.Chicken - Pretty good. It wasn't salty and they did not over cook it.Peking duck - We had the peking duck served with the bun and I think scallions. Our colleague from Atlanta calls it ""chinese taco's"". It was pretty good but I wished it was served at a warmer temperature.Shrimp w/ mayo sauce - This is probably one of my favorite dishes in general. I love shrimp and I love mayo. What I didn't like about the one they made here, it was too yellow looking and the way the dish was presented looked unflattering. Usually at other restaurants, they serve it with the plate rimmed with brocoli or some places add shrimp chips just to give the dish some color and a nicer presentation. The shrimp didn't taste bad but I've had better.As for the rest, we ordered some vegetable that was cooked really well. We also ordered Chow Fun? I dunno what they call some of these dishes in english. But for the rest, they were all okay.Drinks - Tsingtao, Heineken, and Budweiser, tea, Coke, Sprite, House wine, and since it's Chinese New Year, they had a table right by the entrance with a display of priced wine, whiskey, and cognac bottles. I'm not even sure if they have a license for that. If I'm not mistaken, I think in New York, beer and wine license is under 1 license and liquor license is separate. Service - Excellent but towards the end, they were kinda pushing us to leave. The restaurant wasn't full or anything and since it was a company dinner, we wanted to sit and chit chat for a bit but the servers kept coming and asking us if we're done and trying to take away our plates while some of us were still eating.Verdict - Not a bad place at all despite the service towards the end of our evening.

There were empty tables but was kinda silly that they asked my mom and I (table for 2) to wait because all the empty tables were for bigger parties so we had to wait for them to clean up one of the smaller tables. The dinner food was mediocre, nothing special. We ordered the half chicken with gravy, scallop (sold per scallop), and egg tofu with 3 types of mushroom. I was pretty disappointed with the egg tofu dish because it looked like it was sitting in a pool of oil, which I guess is supposed to be the gravy? It was lacking in any flavor. The chicken was okay.They do have a parking lot but it's kinda small and chaotic so we always end up trying to look for street parking which can be a challenge at times because the area is mostly residential.

Could you not pull your customer aside to discuss this instead of accusing him in front of all his guests that he underpaid?

The other 2 are good for satisfying a craving but Lake Pavilion always hits the spot and leaves me the most satisfied.I've been to Lake Pavilion with 2 people, 4 people, and 7 people and each time the place has been quick to seat you and the food has been hot and fresh. The dishes we order are: shrimp dumplings (ha gao), sui mai, spare ribs (pai guat), beef short ribs, shrimp rice rolls (ha churn), bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed peppers, sticky rice, and tripe.The food has been delicious every time. Last time we branched out and tried the roast duck, congee, and beef rice rolls as well. Everyone was very happy with the food. I love that Lake Pavilion is such a large location. I never waited more than 5 or 10 minutes. The carts begin to slow down and the place begins to really clean and close up around 2:45.

The place is enormous and set up like a banquet hall. They have several private rooms, and an huge main seating area with a stage. The Food:We had several dishes including noodles with vegetables, crab salad with eggwhites, braised pork, Peking duck, and an interesting shrimp dish. I'll call particular attention to the Peking duck and shrimp dishes since they were in my opinion far and away the best of the bunch. Peking Duck - an entire duck fried up Peking style. The skin is removed from the duck when crispy and placed with vegetables into steamed buns. The duck is then cut up into manageable cubes and distributed to the party. Everything tasted fantastic. The meat itself was very greasy and rich, and the skin was very crispy and had an almost sweetness to it that went great with the steamed buns. Fried Milk w/ Shrimp - I'm not entirely sure what this dish was, but my Chinese coworkers described it as fried milk. Fried almost sweet croquettes of milk with a creamy yellow sauce and large shrimp pieces on top. Again, everything was delicious. Now I know sweet things with shrimp may not seem all that appetizing, but this is a dish you need to try to believe. Will definitely be on the lookout for this at other Chinese restaurants. Service was very good, the waiters always made sure we had enough water and clean napkins. The portions were all extremely generous. I'm not a particularly big eater, but in our party there were quite a few and they were unable to finish. The final price for this ridiculous feast that 9 people couldn't finish came out to be about $25 a person.

At first glance, the line for the back parking lot feels long, but don't be dissuaded - it goes fast and speaking from experience, you'll park faster if you wait in line rather than drive around for blocks looking for street parking. TIP: While the driver waits in the parking line, jump inside and get on the line to get a table!Waiting for a table feels a bit hectic, but once you sit down - it feels less rushed and the food is 'fresher out of the kitchen' than other Chinatown (Manhattan) choices like Jing Fong.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4653,"Lake Pavilion does a better job with their dinner dishes than dim sum. But even then, many of their dishes are far from perfect. Whenever I come here, I am not the one who orders so I won't be able to list the names and prices. However pictures are as good as words. Crab with Sticky Rice - The crab tasted fresh but it was a mistake to stir fry the rice with the crab. The rice was still a bit hard and bland but the real problem was the amount of crab shells bits mixed in with the rice. You were almost waiting for an unpleasant crunch in each bite. (6/10)Braised Geese with Bean Curd Skin - A very rich and saucy dish. The bean curd skin does a great job in soaking the flavors. But for a $20+ dish, you would expect more meat than just geese necks and offals... (6/10)Stir Fried Bean Sprouts - The vegetables here are always the best, especially the bean sprouts. They were tender and crispy and the clean flavor balances the other salty dishes. (9/10)One dish worth mentioning is the famous ""Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"" advertised on posters all over the walls of the restaurant. This Chinese delicacy is one of the most expensive soups in the world and comprises of many exotic ingredients like shark fin, abalone, sea cucumber, ginseng, dried everything, etc. Being so, this soup is costs over $1000. It was one of the best soups I ever tasted. The flavors were very complex, rich, and sweet. The fusion of all the different ingredients really gives off a flavor that can't be described. But is it worth it to pay that much for this soup? NoLastly and probably the most entertaining thing about the restaurant is when the speakers starts blasting Happy Birthday songs when it's someone's birthday.

At other places they where masks because they spit. The food was okay though.When we came for CNY Eve Dinner that was different. It was crowded and it was Super Bowl Sunday. The people in my party had repeatedly asked if they could broadcast the game but they said no. I guess it was because they didn't want anyone to just stay and watch the game and wanted a constant flow of people going out and coming in. The food wasn't that good though compared to other places.

The restaurant is still very spacious with a good amount of tables. Comfortable setting and seating combined.I must say the food served at night is very good, especially the 1st dish Lobster - extremely fresh - so it was the STAR of the night! The Peking Pork Chops were crispy but did not have enough sour taste to it and sauce covered up. The crispy tofu dish was on point. The veggies were made to perfection. In addition, we ordered the 5th dish, Peking Duck, and it was overly cooked as if they reheated it because the skin was very dark-colored and the meat was semi-dried. The waiter sliced up the duck for us, which was appreciated, but not sure if he cut off all the meat for us. Sadly to say, it was the WORST dish of the night! The husband was craving for a GOOD PEKING DUCK AND WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! In the beginning of dinner, they serve these good tasting sour radish! At the end of dinner, they serve both warm soup dessert (we got red bean with tapioca) AND freshly cut fruit (we got watermelon)!!Overall, I think I'd return for dinnertime with my family and friends for special gatherings.Tip: Valet parking available, but need to tip the guy.

When I went to dim sum the ladies that pushed the carts around and were trying to broadcast what they had spat everywhere. Like you could literally see the saliva coming out of their mouth. Nasty. At other places they where masks because they spit. The food was okay though.When we came for CNY Eve Dinner that was different. It was crowded and it was Super Bowl Sunday. The people in my party had repeatedly asked if they could broadcast the game but they said no. I guess it was because they didn't want anyone to just stay and watch the game and wanted a constant flow of people going out and coming in. The food wasn't that good though compared to other places.

The dishes we order are: shrimp dumplings (ha gao), sui mai, spare ribs (pai guat), beef short ribs, shrimp rice rolls (ha churn), bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed peppers, sticky rice, and tripe.The food has been delicious every time.

The place is enormous and set up like a banquet hall. They have several private rooms, and an huge main seating area with a stage. The Food:We had several dishes including noodles with vegetables, crab salad with eggwhites, braised pork, Peking duck, and an interesting shrimp dish. I'll call particular attention to the Peking duck and shrimp dishes since they were in my opinion far and away the best of the bunch. Peking Duck - an entire duck fried up Peking style. The skin is removed from the duck when crispy and placed with vegetables into steamed buns. The duck is then cut up into manageable cubes and distributed to the party. Everything tasted fantastic. The meat itself was very greasy and rich, and the skin was very crispy and had an almost sweetness to it that went great with the steamed buns. Fried Milk w/ Shrimp - I'm not entirely sure what this dish was, but my Chinese coworkers described it as fried milk. Fried almost sweet croquettes of milk with a creamy yellow sauce and large shrimp pieces on top. Again, everything was delicious. Now I know sweet things with shrimp may not seem all that appetizing, but this is a dish you need to try to believe. Will definitely be on the lookout for this at other Chinese restaurants. Service was very good, the waiters always made sure we had enough water and clean napkins. The portions were all extremely generous. I'm not a particularly big eater, but in our party there were quite a few and they were unable to finish. The final price for this ridiculous feast that 9 people couldn't finish came out to be about $25 a person.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,48947,"I had dinner at this very large restaurant off the LIE (Long Island Expressway) last evening, July 25th with a large group of women attending a conference at Queens College. We were two large tables of 11 each and a small table of three. This was an experience that will be talked about for years to come. Not because of the food, but for the bizarre and ultimately distressing service.Each person ordered individually, which I understand is not the custom, but most of the group were from out of town and on various diets, so this seemed to be the way to go. Each order was taken, and the ticket laid by each plate. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. To be fair, an order of Peking duck arrived almost immediately and was shared at one table. One order of shrimp dumplings arrived after that. My order of shrimp & vegetable dumplings never arrived; I accepted an order of shrimp dumplings instead. This arrived 20 minutes after the first shrimp dumplings. Efforts to talk to the servers met with smiles and gestures and no food. A captain finally came over, and told us the food was coming. Meanwhile an hour after we ordered, the restaurant was full and everyone was eating but us. The small table of three people, who arrived late (because it took them 40 minutes to park the car as the small valet parking lot was full) was served promptly. A bowl of hot and sour soup, ordered by my friend, finally arrived after much complaining and had to be sent back, it was ice cold. My friend's main dish order--fish--only arrived as we were paying the bill, in other words, over 90 minutes after it was ordered. She did not go home hungry--we all shared the dishes that did finally arrive--but she was extremely disappointed and angry as she had been looking forward to this meal for a week. The few dishes that did arrive were very good. But, because the atmosphere had changed from happy expectation to anger and frustration, it was hard to enjoy them. Also, we were surprised that rice had to be ordered separately. This is not acceptable in a restaurant that is already overcharging. And, in our case, the rice did not arrive till we were finished with our food! I would never go to this restaurant again. I thought it significant that our two tables that did not get food were the only tables in the restaurant with no Asian people. Is this a requirement at Lake Pavilion? This was a very embarrassing experience for those of us who were hosting this group. We wanted to show them the great Chinese cuisine Queens had to offer.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4653,"Lake Pavilion does a better job with their dinner dishes than dim sum. But even then, many of their dishes are far from perfect. Whenever I come here, I am not the one who orders so I won't be able to list the names and prices. However pictures are as good as words. Crab with Sticky Rice - The crab tasted fresh but it was a mistake to stir fry the rice with the crab. The rice was still a bit hard and bland but the real problem was the amount of crab shells bits mixed in with the rice. You were almost waiting for an unpleasant crunch in each bite. (6/10)Braised Geese with Bean Curd Skin - A very rich and saucy dish. The bean curd skin does a great job in soaking the flavors. But for a $20+ dish, you would expect more meat than just geese necks and offals... (6/10)Stir Fried Bean Sprouts - The vegetables here are always the best, especially the bean sprouts. They were tender and crispy and the clean flavor balances the other salty dishes. (9/10)One dish worth mentioning is the famous ""Buddha Jumps Over the Wall"" advertised on posters all over the walls of the restaurant. This Chinese delicacy is one of the most expensive soups in the world and comprises of many exotic ingredients like shark fin, abalone, sea cucumber, ginseng, dried everything, etc. Being so, this soup is costs over $1000. It was one of the best soups I ever tasted. The flavors were very complex, rich, and sweet. The fusion of all the different ingredients really gives off a flavor that can't be described. But is it worth it to pay that much for this soup? NoLastly and probably the most entertaining thing about the restaurant is when the speakers starts blasting Happy Birthday songs when it's someone's birthday.

Because it was my first time seeing up close and personal a lion dance performance in a restaurant on CNY.  So we came here on an untraditionally late dim sum (2pm) just so we thought we could beat the crowd. It was still jammed pack but surprisingly we got seated pretty quickly. The carts came rolling by our table immediately with the typical dim sum varieties: steamed pork buns, siu mai, and churn funs. Har gows always seem to make a late appearance but we still got it towards the end. But the highlight, as I mentioned earlier, was the lion dance. I heard the drums and gongs outside of the restaurant and typically, they usually just do a little dance outside of a business establishment. But no, this was a full out performance and they pretty much went to greet each and every table in the restaurant.  It was quite a spectacle.  Thanks for the entertainment! As far as dim sum goes, this place isn't bad. It's cleaner and more organized than most of other establishments within the vicinity.  I think what sets them apart from other dim sums in Flushing is their décor and service.

Needless to say, Palace held a special place in my heart. It was sad to find out it closed. In its place is Lake Pavilion. I'll hold my judgement until I dine here.Well, I dined here. A few notes... Parking - Sucks. Don't bother parking at the lot. Look for parking on the street instead. Waiting for a table - Not bad. We were seated pretty much immediately. This was around 1pm. Service - Mediocre. The ladies with the dim sum cart doesn't always stop at the table letting you know what's available. Wait staff is eh. What is it about refilling tea pots at dim sum places? The waiters see the lid tilted sideways (clear indication that the tea pot is empty), but they always lift it up to make sure there really is no more tea. Why would we lie?? We're thirsty!Food - Speaking of tea pots... They're teeny tiny. Only large enough to fill 2-3 tea cups, also teeny tiny. As for the dim sum, variety is not the issue. There is a huge selection. My gripe is that the food is not hot. Every dish we got was lukewarm. Now, what really got to me were the bathrooms. The bathrooms are located right next to the entrance/exit to and from the parking lot. The men's bathroom door was WIDE open. Women, kids, family walking by can see men standing front of the urinals. I have no problem with a certain level of exhibitionist, but seeing men peeing? Ain't no one got time or tolerance for that!

My family reserved one of the private rooms on the side of the main dining area. The room was beautifully decorated: crystal chandelier, full-height gold wall art flanked by plush silver paneling. The table settings were pretty upscale; the teacups even came with their own saucers. We ordered a standard set menu with multiple courses (I can't remember if it was 8 or 10). The food was all done well, even the triple lobsters (yep, not just twin lobsters, but TRIPLE). They even gave us huge slices of braised abalone and a large fish filled with roe!

Bees are $5, which is not bad. Will have dinner here again minus the private room. Overall service was better than expected. I was very surprised.

I used to frequent Tung Yi Fung in Flushing, but my family now prefers the closer Lake Pavilion. I love their veggies (watercress with garlic and tofu/mushroom dish), seafood selection (prawns and fish that I never know the English name to), and salmon fried rice.

I like dinner here. I LOVEEEEE the Alaskan snow crab here. Mmm that sauce! I also enjoy the snails, sauce is amazing. Walnut shrimp is delicious. Love the lobster udon noodles, altho very gingery. I eat the fried rice a lot, it's tasty here with raisins. Sea cucumber taste like nothing, so does shark fin soup. Btw think that's totally banned now so it's all ""fake"".

Finally, after around 20 minutes of us just attempting to enjoy our food, he marches over to our table and demand that we hurry to finish because they have a time limit on tables.

interesting, ""authentic"" (if you're into that kinda thing) and well prepared.  However, you don't eat at Lake Pavillion for the service or ambiance unless you are a masochist.  The bright purple tablecloths and pink ribbons around the chairs almost made me feel like I was eating in a doll house.  Every 10 minutes or so they would blast a happy birthday song at extreme levels, with no apparent relation to anyone actually celebrating a birthday in the restaurant at the time that we could see.  We just learned to avoid conversation until the 3rd chorus came around and the end of the song was near...   After we ordered, the waiter, who was very patient and friendly, took about 5 minutes to hover over our table and write out the check before bringing it to the kitchen, occasionally re-asking us what we ordered.  After the food arrived, one server stood in front of our table for a bit too long and watched my father's own style of adding a bit of rice into his peaking duck steamed buns with amazement.  Despite those occasional awkward moments, and their tendency to linger,  the staff was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions.  Better service than more places I've eaten in this area.  I've eaten here about 5 times about the food is always excellent and the portions huge.  My father loved the sweet and sour pork.  The Peking duck was well browned, crispy, and after the breast was sliced they brought the rest of the animal back in small pieces to chew at the small tender bits of duck meat around the bones.  The seafood soup with vegetables was very good, a stronger, deeper flavor broth that I usually get with this dish at other restaurants, the squid was exceptionally tender, the shrimp not over cooked.  The shrimp with honey walnuts was great although a bit too indulgent for me.  It is a plate full of fried food, so its understandable quite heavy.  I finished about half and was very satisfied.  The beautiful tender rectangles of sweet fried condensed milk are simply amazing, although i'm not sure I needed a third fried item on the plate.  Steamed flounder is perfect and deboned properly table side.  Crispy fried small fish are delicious and crunchy.  Fried rice with salmon is umami, just a tad fishy, and very comforting.  One of the best dishes they serve is the Triple Crispy (Shrimp, Scallop and Squid) which is fried, salt and pepper style.  Perfect fried fish, not too salty, the squid still tender, the shrimp retaining their flavor as the are cooked in the shell, served with crispy shallots and peppers this dish is highly recommended.  The complementary sweet tofu skin soup dessert we were served once was a great warm ending to a nice meal.  I really love this place.  The quality and preparation of the food far outweighs any awkwardness on the part of the staff.  Prices were fair, portions were huge, definitely recommended!",4.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS,

No.I head over there and it was lunch time. Place was crowded but we were seated right away as we were just a party of 2. We sat down and was very happy with the ambiance and how the good the place looks. The dim sum carts started to stroll around. Two of the carts that I like finally came around. First cart was the tripe cart and I odered that. Then the classic strimp dumpling and pork dumpling cart. Both of the ladies bought the food to the table at the same time. They marked my card and then I ordered one more dish from the second lady. She came back to the table and marked my card again.I caught her as she was trying to go for the 3rd stamp... again! She looks up and argues with me and said that she didn't stamp my card. With attitude she said well what did you eat before? I pointed out to her that there are only 4 dishes on the table and our plates and utensils are clean cause we just sat down. She finally realized that she messed up. I told her thats ok but just have someone void out the extra 2 stamps. She turns around and tell the waiter behind what happened and he comes back refusing to void the stamps because it causes confusion. They said just order food of the same value and it'll even out. They go about with their job leaving us frustrated and confused. How would the next person come along and know that we've already been stamped? Finally, I waved done the supervisors and explained to him what happened and what our concerns are. He voided the 2 stamps but he was not happy. Not one apology from anyone of them. We went about eating and this is what ended our lunch then and there. We ordered a plate of green vegetables and 2 pieces in..and we find a huge worm! That grossed us out and we had to leave. We lost our appetites and wondered about how the prepared the food. If they cleaned the items properly. Waved down another supervisor and voided that plate too. Paid the bill and left. All they kept doing is try to cover up. The dim sum lady just kept bring me stuff that I don't want trying to cover her mistakes.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,5979,"One of the worst dim sum place and Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. And here's why:1) Food does not taste fresh. I was here for dim sum twice(giving it a second chance) and something is wrong with their meats. Shrimps in shrimp dumplings and pork in soup pork buns taste like it's been in the fridge for weeks...I was here for a wedding to try their actual food and it's as worst as it gets. Food is too salty and once again tasting stale...2) Service is horrible. The dim sum cart ladies aggressively hands you the dim sums even when you say NO. I mean I don't want it! Stop shoving it in my face! I asked the waiters 2 times to refill my tea and they never came back.3) This place is super crowded when it first opened up because it's new and tons of people want to try it out, but the hype is now over so it's not as crowded as it use to be.4) My friend had his wedding here and the area they rented out to him doesn't even have a dance floor.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,6510,"In many ways this place is perfect reflection of my usual experience in Flushing and Chinatown, the food for the most part is excellent, interesting, ""authentic"" (if you're into that kinda thing) and well prepared.  However, you don't eat at Lake Pavillion for the service or ambiance unless you are a masochist.  The bright purple tablecloths and pink ribbons around the chairs almost made me feel like I was eating in a doll house.  Every 10 minutes or so they would blast a happy birthday song at extreme levels, with no apparent relation to anyone actually celebrating a birthday in the restaurant at the time that we could see.  We just learned to avoid conversation until the 3rd chorus came around and the end of the song was near...   After we ordered, the waiter, who was very patient and friendly, took about 5 minutes to hover over our table and write out the check before bringing it to the kitchen, occasionally re-asking us what we ordered.  After the food arrived, one server stood in front of our table for a bit too long and watched my father's own style of adding a bit of rice into his peaking duck steamed buns with amazement.  Despite those occasional awkward moments, and their tendency to linger,  the staff was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions.  Better service than more places I've eaten in this area.  I've eaten here about 5 times about the food is always excellent and the portions huge.  My father loved the sweet and sour pork.  The Peking duck was well browned, crispy, and after the breast was sliced they brought the rest of the animal back in small pieces to chew at the small tender bits of duck meat around the bones.  The seafood soup with vegetables was very good, a stronger, deeper flavor broth that I usually get with this dish at other restaurants, the squid was exceptionally tender, the shrimp not over cooked.  The shrimp with honey walnuts was great although a bit too indulgent for me.  It is a plate full of fried food, so its understandable quite heavy.  I finished about half and was very satisfied.  The beautiful tender rectangles of sweet fried condensed milk are simply amazing, although i'm not sure I needed a third fried item on the plate.  Steamed flounder is perfect and deboned properly table side.  Crispy fried small fish are delicious and crunchy.  Fried rice with salmon is umami, just a tad fishy, and very comforting.  One of the best dishes they serve is the Triple Crispy (Shrimp, Scallop and Squid) which is fried, salt and pepper style.  Perfect fried fish, not too salty, the squid still tender, the shrimp retaining their flavor as the are cooked in the shell, served with crispy shallots and peppers this dish is highly recommended.  The complementary sweet tofu skin soup dessert we were served once was a great warm ending to a nice meal.  I really love this place.  The quality and preparation of the food far outweighs any awkwardness on the part of the staff.  Prices were fair, portions were huge, definitely recommended!",4.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS,

Saying that, I wish it was still that place.Decided to check this restaurant out with my family for my mother's birthday, and it wasn't a good one. First the parking. You have to pay a $2 tip for the ""valets"". They offered to park our car,  which my father refused and parked himself but he still had to pay the tip. Not a good start.Going into the restaurant the first thing we noticed was that the place was very noisy and crowded. We were then led to our table and as soon as we sat down we were bombarded with ladies and their dim sum carts. The lady was offering and we took what seemed good, which was some dumplings and shrimp siomai. They tasted no different from other similar restaurants. What bothered us was that these carts would not leave us alone, even if we said ""no thank you"". And they did not attempt to speak a little English when they could clearly see that we don't speak Chinese. We had to resort to sign language, waving them away.It also took forever for a waiter to come by and serve us. We had to flag one down and get their attention to order. When he finally arrived he gave us only one menu for all four of us. Looking at the prices they seemed pretty expensive for dishes that you would normally find in a Chinese take out place. We ordered chicken & broccoli, seafood platter, and roast duck.We waited a good 30 minutes before the food came. Now during that wait those cart ladies were at us again. Wouldn't leave us alone. One lady actually took one of the plates and placed it on our table without asking us. Very rude. The dishes we ordered were just bland as they can be, in taste and presentation. The portions did not match the prices either. The Chinese take out spot we usually go to that's across the street from here are cheaper, gave bigger portions, and actually tasted better.In the end we paid about $60 for what is probably the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. Staff were disrespectful (especially those cart ladies) and their appearances were not up to standard. For example our waiter's suit was very dirty and he had this one long strand of facial hair I've ever seen going down to his chest. The service was not organized at all. Everybody was running around, some waiters were just standing still looking into space. The food was flavorless. Tasted like everything was just boiled and served.

After we asked 3 times and 10 minutes later, a floor manager finally brought some tea.Then, the waiter came to take the order. We asked what fishes they have, the waiter replied with a short list, while his eyes wondering somewhere else, very rude. After that, we ordered steamed pork sth on the menu. He straight up said, we couldn't do it. While my family was trying to figure out what else we could order to replace this dish we wanted to try. I couldn't help myself but ask this waiter what do you have and that you could make? If you don't do it why do you have it on the menu. He went ,oh it's not like we couldn't do it, but it takes more than an hour to make, then you will yell/curse at me because you waited too long. That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard a waiter say! First of all, why did you say you could not make it in the first place if that's not the case, then why couldn't you explain this dish will take a long time to make, and if you did all that and we still would like to try it, why would we yell at you?? I wasn't going to spend 70 dollars on a fish dish and yet have to endure this kind of service, so we left immediately and definitely not going back and will NOT RECOMMEND anyone to go there.

We've been at this place for dim sum and the food were ok so we decided to go there to celebrate our annual Chinese New Year's family dinner there. We pre-ordered the special set dinner (what their version of ""Buddhist jumping wall"") for $800. They did a wonderful job on the menu in describing the 10-course meal. We were expecting a once in a life time meal, given the price tag. I even skipped lunch, anticipating a heavy and delicious traditional Chinese banquet style meal. Oh boy, was I disappointed. We booked a private room, which was $100 more, so we can have more privacy. But the minute I walked into the room, I knew something was wrong. The room was extremely hot, without proper ventilation. Then when the food came, everything went downhill...EVERY single dishes was either too salty, greasy or taste like shxt. We expected more for a meal close to a grand, when you factor in taxes and gratuity. In the end, we left the place half full with empty wallets. Overall, the food and services were substandard, and the menu presented to us during reservation was misleading. Dim sum is okay but this place is def not a place to go for dinner!!

I was kind of upset that this place replace Palace Diner because I really like that diner. I came here after my brother's graduation. We just got to our table, and the ladies pushing the carts were attacking us. I swear I just sat down and there was like 3 or 4 carts surrounding us. Everything tasted ok, I didnt think it was really good compare to the other dim sum places I been too. Some of their food like the pork and shrimp dumplings was really bland. It needed some spicy sauce to make it taste good. We also pork pan fried noodle and it came with too much celery and the sweet and sour pork chop and it was super salty.I am not in love with the staff, they were pushy, one lady kept trying to put items on our table. I noticed something we didnt order and asked her about it and she said she was just showing us. I am not to sure about it because she kept doing it. We told her a few times, we didnt want the item and she would put it on our table anyway and she would just say she wants to show you. She was quite annoying. In addition, I asked the manager if he can get me some hot tofu because I been waiting 15 minutes for it and I havent seen it. I also gave him the option, if he could to send the hot tofu cart to our table because we been waiting for a while. He said it was coming. I think when we were about to leave and we paid the bill, the hot tofu cart arrived. This is about 30 minutes later. We also asked the manager to bring or send the shrimp noodle/ beef noodle our way and he said it coming. I saw the other managers bring dim sum to the other tables, so i wasnt sure why this manager wouldnt.

The food was very bland lacking in taste nothing worth really talking about , instead it felt like a bowl of salt as I felt the three dishes were all too salty.  So as we finished our dishes we were greeted to some oranges to finish up not bad.  So I must say it's just nothing special to me!  Food could use less salt and more taste!  I prefer the Corner 28 restaurant down in the heart of Flushing by far to be the best Chinese restaurant.  Also on another positive note it takes credit card unlike other most Chinese restaurants.",2.0 star rating,"Queens Village, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"Flushing,Red Bowl,work,spot,plan,coworker,Pho,hostess,food,Hoang,mouth,table,someone,whatever,service,crowd,much,order,anyone,seafood menu,table,something,seafood,dishes,someone,order menu,menu,beef,awhile,side,tea,no,broccoli,fried rice,pork chop,dishes,nothing,bowl,salt,restaurant,oranges,Food,restaurant,restaurants,credit card,nothing,salt,taste,heart,note,Prices,Food,table,dishes,Chinese,one,Corner 28,portions","2,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,3,2","0.195847809315,0.0932770892978,0.0720845907927,0.0570380464196,0.0411425754428,0.0344927608967,0.0344927608967,0.033380843699,0.0315620414913,0.0204687286168,0.0180302001536,0.0164434928447,0.0161223225296,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0129235591739,0.0123361106962,0.0110509581864,0.0110107809305,0.0110107809305,0.0103102102876,0.0100618321449,0.0100484164432,0.0100484164432,0.00978673435748,0.00915246177465,0.00885064527392,0.00881631206721,0.00877881795168,0.00876398198307,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00747690256685,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.00632576318458,0.00595033960417,0.00516864191741,0.00516467122361,0.00516093056649,0.00478163547814,0.00470493640751,0.00470108864829,0.00470108864829,0.0041098059155,0.00410682847723,0.00381957809441,0.00363743188791,0.00329415220767,0.00324184051715,0.00313625950366,0.00261796475388,0.00243274052627,0.00113215181045"
New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,6031,"This is a review of the take out portion of the restaurant. When this place first opened, I was mildly surprised at the layout. The parking lot required a $2 tip although advertised as free. The take out section had a separate door. I came here at 4pm to the dim sum and roast duck/pork area and proceeded to ask how much the dim sum was since they had so little left, which is completely understandable at this time of the day. The lady says $1.50 each dish but I'll sell it to you for a dollar each if you buy ten. Leftovers but it's a deal! She then gets pushy and demands that I take a certain amount of this and that but I didn't mind. She then tells me to take out two more dollars since she has some leftover fried taro balls and spring rolls. I pay her, DRIVE away only to find out that these items were NOT placed in my bag. I was going to let it go but I decided to DRIVE back 30 minutes later just to confirm. As I ask the lady, she decides this is her time of the month to yell at me saying that I did take possession of said items. She did not bother checking to see if she made a mistake, which she surely did. Sure.... I DROVE away and BACK to rip off a restaurant. Gas is +$4.25 a gallon.  Are you kidding me?

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,44812,"Our relatives had finally made it down from upstate for a Chinese New Year's dinner. We had a full reservation for 14 seats. Our table was set up for us and there was a very short wait time. However, the table was not properly cleaned - we found sauces and unknown bits of food staining the cloth and underneath our glasses. Never mind that obvious overlook. We finally get to ordering - around 8-9 dishes. A 40 minute wait ensues, and when we finally begin receiving our dishes, they are dead cold, and only vegetables. They brought our appetizer - a seafood soup - after a few vegetables, on a PLATE. Why? Why would you do that? Is it not logical to put liquids in a bowl? Needless to say, it was a terrible mess. The entire time while we were eating, the manager was shouting around us. Finally, after around 20 minutes of us just attempting to enjoy our food, he marches over to our table and demand that we hurry to finish because they have a time limit on tables. He then proceeds to argue with my dad over dishes and finally leans over, grabs our check and menu, and vehemently crosses out any dish we had not received thus far (around 4-5). We were then literally KICKED OUT of the restaurant with him shouting that the other family could now take our seats. It was over $300, and we ate 3 plates of boiled vegetables and 1 PLATE of soup. Give me a break. That's no way to treat a customer, even if it's Chinese New Year. The lobby was crowded with families and as we walked out, there were exasperated sighs of ""Oh, finally, another table"". Seriously.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,58496,"Came here with the family for Chinese New Years a few days ago. We already had reservations set so seating wasn't a problem. The restaurant however was packed way beyond capacity. Already from the start I knew the management was a mess. I had overheard waiters discussing how they overbooked the restaurant and turned away families who had reservations because other parties were already there and management didn't want to have an empty table. That alone is an embarrassment to the ethics of a restaurant.I understand it's the new year and its incredibly busy but this is no excuse for poor service and execution of the dishes. The food overall was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary for Chinese family style restaurants in Flushing. HOWEVER. The execution was an embarrassment. Every dish we ordered came out on an ice cold plate. I don't mean a little cold, i mean it seemed to have been left outside and sprayed down with a hose to clean. This meant all the food was instantly cold on the pass to the table. The most absurd thing was that we were told to accept it because it was CNY and its ""how it is"". Are you kidding me? Another case was when we ordered the fried tofu and vegetable stir fry, it came out without the tofu...just a plate of vegetables. Like serving steak and fries without the steak. Really?? We told the waiter that this was not right and he looked at us dumbfounded and speechless. His incompetence attracted the floor manager who came by and asked him what the problem was. After he told her, she just told him to serve it and it didn't matter. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. I looked at her in disbelief and was about to lose it before she asked him to take it back. Overall, this was by far the worst meal I've ever had in Flushing. From the food to the service to seeing the mess of a management team, I will not be wasting any future celebrations here. PS: I saw a waiter who dropped a raw fish from the bag and tried to pick it up with his hands but failed several times. He then proceeded to kick it under the service table and with those dirty hands, he grabbed a bunch of plates and cups to set the next table. really? really? come on now. can I see some decency in this ""restaurant""?",1.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,-0.300000011921,14.3000001907,"restaurant.,management,waiters,family,restaurant,Chinese New Years,restaurant,embarrassment,problem,seating,reservations,floor manager,meal,way,capacity,start,waiter,case,families,PS,waiter,embarrassment,table,management,service,reservations,execution,dishes,food,food,ethics,restaurants,table,dish,plate,thing,plate,steak,Flushing,fried tofu,vegetable,tofu,vegetables,steak,Nothing,ordinary,family style,hose,pass,stir fry,fries,incompetence,food,service,mess,celebrations,management team,bag,fish,restaurant,parties,service table,table,Chinese,plates,hands,hands,decency,times,bunch,cups,problem,FRONT,disbelief,US","7,7,1,1,2,4,2,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,4,3,6,7,2,3,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.135206669569,0.112565837801,0.0625648647547,0.0523987933993,0.0339698120952,0.0283857192844,0.0283011011779,0.0247793979943,0.0242979321629,0.0238301549107,0.0228135120124,0.02213043347,0.0220615174621,0.0211647264659,0.0198706798255,0.0197986662388,0.0187076255679,0.0156578682363,0.0134859234095,0.0134492041543,0.011492472142,0.010676885955,0.0102096954361,0.0100813163444,0.00946508161724,0.00862996652722,0.00861007068306,0.00861007068306,0.00761747360229,0.00755799561739,0.00753423664719,0.00727879581973,0.00681265303865,0.00638531893492,0.00634337682277,0.00600990606472,0.00577759835869,0.00552417337894,0.0053784949705,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525521161035,0.00525117618963,0.00506888469681,0.00506888469681,0.00506888469681,0.00504290824756,0.00503779621795,0.004598043859,0.0045945122838,0.00458505935967,0.00429255980998,0.00429255980998,0.00390430144034,0.00341590843163,0.00341590843163,0.00341421063058,0.00341421063058,0.00338782533072,0.0032721911557,0.00319581804797,0.00319581804797,0.00300112832338,0.00296918279491,0.0027018270921,0.00270053441636,0.00244993995875,0.00236375606619,0.00236262497492,0.00236262497492,0.00205089664087,0.00150050735101,0.0014996615937,0.000888051232323"

We just got to our table, and the ladies pushing the carts were attacking us. I swear I just sat down and there was like 3 or 4 carts surrounding us. Everything tasted ok, I didnt think it was really good compare to the other dim sum places I been too. Some of their food like the pork and shrimp dumplings was really bland. It needed some spicy sauce to make it taste good. We also pork pan fried noodle and it came with too much celery and the sweet and sour pork chop and it was super salty.I am not in love with the staff, they were pushy, one lady kept trying to put items on our table. I noticed something we didnt order and asked her about it and she said she was just showing us. I am not to sure about it because she kept doing it. We told her a few times, we didnt want the item and she would put it on our table anyway and she would just say she wants to show you. She was quite annoying. In addition, I asked the manager if he can get me some hot tofu because I been waiting 15 minutes for it and I havent seen it. I also gave him the option, if he could to send the hot tofu cart to our table because we been waiting for a while. He said it was coming. I think when we were about to leave and we paid the bill, the hot tofu cart arrived. This is about 30 minutes later. We also asked the manager to bring or send the shrimp noodle/ beef noodle our way and he said it coming.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,58496,"Came here with the family for Chinese New Years a few days ago. We already had reservations set so seating wasn't a problem. The restaurant however was packed way beyond capacity. Already from the start I knew the management was a mess. I had overheard waiters discussing how they overbooked the restaurant and turned away families who had reservations because other parties were already there and management didn't want to have an empty table. That alone is an embarrassment to the ethics of a restaurant.I understand it's the new year and its incredibly busy but this is no excuse for poor service and execution of the dishes. The food overall was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary for Chinese family style restaurants in Flushing. HOWEVER. The execution was an embarrassment. Every dish we ordered came out on an ice cold plate. I don't mean a little cold, i mean it seemed to have been left outside and sprayed down with a hose to clean. This meant all the food was instantly cold on the pass to the table. The most absurd thing was that we were told to accept it because it was CNY and its ""how it is"". Are you kidding me? Another case was when we ordered the fried tofu and vegetable stir fry, it came out without the tofu...just a plate of vegetables. Like serving steak and fries without the steak. Really?? We told the waiter that this was not right and he looked at us dumbfounded and speechless. His incompetence attracted the floor manager who came by and asked him what the problem was. After he told her, she just told him to serve it and it didn't matter. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. I looked at her in disbelief and was about to lose it before she asked him to take it back. Overall, this was by far the worst meal I've ever had in Flushing. From the food to the service to seeing the mess of a management team, I will not be wasting any future celebrations here. PS: I saw a waiter who dropped a raw fish from the bag and tried to pick it up with his hands but failed several times.

The food was very bland lacking in taste nothing worth really talking about , instead it felt like a bowl of salt as I felt the three dishes were all too salty.  So as we finished our dishes we were greeted to some oranges to finish up not bad.  So I must say it's just nothing special to me!  Food could use less salt and more taste!  I prefer the Corner 28 restaurant down in the heart of Flushing by far to be the best Chinese restaurant.  Also on another positive note it takes credit card unlike other most Chinese restaurants.",2.0 star rating,"Queens Village, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"Flushing,Red Bowl,work,spot,plan,coworker,Pho,hostess,food,Hoang,mouth,table,someone,whatever,service,crowd,much,order,anyone,seafood menu,table,something,seafood,dishes,someone,order menu,menu,beef,awhile,side,tea,no,broccoli,fried rice,pork chop,dishes,nothing,bowl,salt,restaurant,oranges,Food,restaurant,restaurants,credit card,nothing,salt,taste,heart,note,Prices,Food,table,dishes,Chinese,one,Corner 28,portions","2,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,3,2","0.195847809315,0.0932770892978,0.0720845907927,0.0570380464196,0.0411425754428,0.0344927608967,0.0344927608967,0.033380843699,0.0315620414913,0.0204687286168,0.0180302001536,0.0164434928447,0.0161223225296,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0131388064474,0.0129235591739,0.0123361106962,0.0110509581864,0.0110107809305,0.0110107809305,0.0103102102876,0.0100618321449,0.0100484164432,0.0100484164432,0.00978673435748,0.00915246177465,0.00885064527392,0.00881631206721,0.00877881795168,0.00876398198307,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00800835713744,0.00747690256685,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.0068072215654,0.00632576318458,0.00595033960417,0.00516864191741,0.00516467122361,0.00516093056649,0.00478163547814,0.00470493640751,0.00470108864829,0.00470108864829,0.0041098059155,0.00410682847723,0.00381957809441,0.00363743188791,0.00329415220767,0.00324184051715,0.00313625950366,0.00261796475388,0.00243274052627,0.00113215181045"
New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,6031,"This is a review of the take out portion of the restaurant. When this place first opened, I was mildly surprised at the layout. The parking lot required a $2 tip although advertised as free. The take out section had a separate door. I came here at 4pm to the dim sum and roast duck/pork area and proceeded to ask how much the dim sum was since they had so little left, which is completely understandable at this time of the day. The lady says $1.50 each dish but I'll sell it to you for a dollar each if you buy ten. Leftovers but it's a deal! She then gets pushy and demands that I take a certain amount of this and that but I didn't mind. She then tells me to take out two more dollars since she has some leftover fried taro balls and spring rolls. I pay her, DRIVE away only to find out that these items were NOT placed in my bag. I was going to let it go but I decided to DRIVE back 30 minutes later just to confirm. As I ask the lady, she decides this is her time of the month to yell at me saying that I did take possession of said items. She did not bother checking to see if she made a mistake, which she surely did. Sure.... I DROVE away and BACK to rip off a restaurant. Gas is +$4.25 a gallon.  Are you kidding me?

The parking lot was full, but I found parking on the street. As soon as I stepped inside, it was pretty chaotic.Now, I've been to plenty of dim sum places, and they are usually chaotic, with the shouting of numbers and hungry people swarming the hostess. But that's a controlled chaos. Here, it was just chaotic. The hostess was situated sort of in the middle of the front, where people were coming at her from the front door AND the back where the parking lot entrance was. Then she had who I am assuming was her superior yelling at her, basically saying ""what the heck are you doing, give the larger group the table, not have 3 parties share!"". This superior came to yell at the hostess at least 3 times while I was waiting for a table - 15 minutes.When my boyfriend and I were seated, we ended up sharing the table with a party of 3, which was fine. They set plates in front of us and eventually brought the tea, and then a couple of food carts came by. That's when we - all 5 of us - realized they forgot to bring us chopsticks.It didn't take very long for them to rectify the situation, and we ordered a couple of dishes from the 2 carts. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. This place is pretty big, so I was surprised to find that there were only FOUR carts rolling, and they were going so slow. We ended up ordering something from the kitchen instead of waiting for the carts to reach us.  And when they did, the selections were pretty basic. Nothing special, and everything tasted fine. Again, nothing special. What we got from the kitchen, though - pan fried noodles with shredded pork - was excellent.I would not come here again. It was out of the way and pretty ordinary overall.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,147007,"This is a convenient location for dim sum due to it's location outside of the busy and congested downtown Flushing area. It's right off the LIE highway on exit 23. It was formally Palace Diner for a number of years. There is valet parking behind the restaurant, as well as parking in front and on the streets. Both times I've been here, the wait time has been short despite it usually being packed. As with most dim sum restaurants, expect to be potentially seated with other people at the same table. Ask for the chrysanthemum tea, which is lighter and sweeter than the usual black tea that's served in Chinese restaurants. Dim sum carts are constantly going around so you're never short of waiting for food to come. Just tell the cart ladies what you want or point to it. There is staff that occasionally comes by to change out your plate for a clean one and bring you another fresh pot of tea. Service is quick and on point. There is a separate take-out location on side of the place.Personal picks:Egg tartsCongeeDuck feetSpare ribsCha siu cherngChive shrimp dumplingSteam custard bun",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,5.19999980927,"location,sum,location,area,downtown,Flushing,chrysanthemum tea,black tea,valet parking,restaurant,LIE highway,exit,number,carts,dim sum restaurants,parking,restaurants,sum,times,streets,front,people,table,Palace Diner,tea,Service,location,one,plate,point,pot,Chinese,side,picks,custard bun,shrimp,staff,food,dumplingSteam,Egg tartsCongeeDuck feetSpare ribsCha siu cherngChive,cart ladies","2,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,1,7,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,2,1","0.378021508455,0.0812724381685,0.0812724381685,0.0651205927134,0.0651205927134,0.0389762148261,0.0289536193013,0.0233917161822,0.0167121719569,0.0150105701759,0.0120629174635,0.0120629174635,0.0120013309643,0.0117853125557,0.0100982096046,0.00923465006053,0.00922533124685,0.00920977443457,0.00920864194632,0.00808239076287,0.00808239076287,0.00804105587304,0.00804105587304,0.00758111383766,0.00686606112868,0.00668458361179,0.00581110967323,0.00546580180526,0.00546580180526,0.0054592108354,0.00469534890726,0.00435212161392,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00377703248523,0.00293829874136,0.00240576011129,0.00223647453822,0.00223647453822,0.00170585711021"

Never have I ever had a cart-lady ask us over and over again if we wanted the same item that we said we didn't want. My girlfriend had wanted a dessert that most dim sum places carry and was told by a manager that it was coming around in a cart or that it was coming out soon. After a 20 minute wait and only when we were going to leave did it appear. The food did not taste that great. Mostly the pan friend noodles we ordered had too much celery added to it and was loaded with corn starch.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,86909,"Food was not that great. Service was worse than the food. To top it off, they would not accept our credit card because we ordered two dim sum dishes as part of our meal. Mind you, our total bill was nearly $250. Because of two dishes that totaled $10, they would not accept credit card. WHAT. THE. HECK? What kind of lame excuse of a policy is that? Let's call a spade a spade, ladies and gentlemen. When establishments like this see a credit card, they cower in fear over the merchant fees associated with it. I get it, you're a business and it cuts into profits. You know how businesses deal with that? They just don't accept it. Cash only. Boom, simple as that. If you can't deal with merchant fees, why bother accepting credit cards in the first place? Why ruin an otherwise already lackluster meal with stupid made up policies like this? I should have just sat there at the table, card in hand, until they gave up. That way, we'll see what they like better, a table being taken up on a busy day, or sucking up and taking a 1-2% merchant fee.Speaking of stupid policies and rules, they state that parking is free but you have to tip $2. Like, you HAVE to or else your keys are withheld. Valet parking should always be tipped, but its also up to the driver to tip how much. Mind you, the valet parking is also super slow when busy (I waited so long that a street parking spot opened up and I just did it myself). And the parking lot is tiny, why the hell is there even valet parking???? Oh right, another way to make a quick buck. It's not free parking. It's $2 parking.

The Chinese name of this place, ""Dong Yun Ge"" is of a very good Chinese restaurant that used to be at Franklin Ave. and Main St. I think it's because it named itself ""East Lake"" that the restaurant was able to create a buzz for itself. (When it first opened, it attracted a lot of attention from the Chinese community)First off the renovation from the old Palace Diner, which was what this restaurant used to be before it became this restaurant. Not too much has changed on the outside of the restaurant except that they stuck on the ugly restaurant signage and tacky LED lights. The inside of the restaurant however is a hot mess. Other dim sum restaurants like Asian Jewels, Jade Asian and East are tastefully decorated/renovated. Here the inside is a mismatch of ugly wood, weird marble pillars, ugly carpeting, ugly chandeliers and a huge bright LED sign over at their dragon and phoenix wall. It shocks me as to how they were able to change such a beautiful diner like Palace Diner into this particular monstrosity.I ordered the usual dim sum foods that I would at any other dim sum restaurant and it's hands down terrible. The ngau pak yi (Beef tripe) was overly tender, the congee didn't taste good, the cheong fun was blah and their fried rice tasted like white rice with yellow food coloring.Overall, this place is ugly to sit in, the food isn't good and parking costs $2 (Though, to be fair all dim sum restaurant require you to pay $2 for parking. Here, they've put up a sign in Chinese that says that $2 tips are compulsory) and you have to park the car yourself.

A little more spice would made even better. My fiancee had steamed clams in sauce, also very good. We went late and place was nearly empty, even so the service was lacking.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,158230,"I am surprise at some of the bad comments about this restaurant. So far, I really like this place. Since its grand opening, I've been here several times with friends and families. Regarding food selection, this restaurant has the most extensive Chinese menu that i had ever seen. There are many unique dishes on the menu that i had just never heard of before and looks like seafood is its specialty. Let's talk about dim sum first. They have all the standard stuff such as Shao Mai, egg custard,which are all very yummy.  But they also have unique dishes that I never had in other places nor know the the names in English; :) So far, one of my favorites has been the jelly cakes, :) but most other things were really yummy too. I also like their tea, which seems to be better quality than other restaurants. This is now the must go dim sum place for our families. For dinner, I've been here three times. The most recent one was for mother's day. Knowing that the restaurant scene on mother's day is always so crazy, my sister in-law made the reservation weeks in advance. Our reservation was at 6m Sunday evening and we were seated at 6pm sharp. we had selected a pre-fixe dinner menu with various type of dishes including walnut shrimps, fried flounder, steak etc. The food was served righ away. I must say that I was so nicely surprise how tender and juicy the steak was, which I didn't expect form a Chinese restaurant. And everything else was just tasty. My entire family had enjoyed the dinner very  much and we all had a great time.  One very unique thing about this place is the setting and layout. I love the VIP rooms and that's where we had the mother's day dinner. Its just a perfect place for friends and families gathering and it made the entire dining experience just extremely pleasant. I see most people complained about services. I don't know if we've been lucky or we focus more on the food. :) Of all these times we dined here, we haven't had any bad experience with services. Again, we just keep coming back for the food. Overall,  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice Chinese restaurant for dimsum and dinner with great food.",5.0 star rating,"Staten Island, NY",3,0,0.5,16.7000007629,"surprise,menu,restaurant,some,comments,specialty,restaurant,place,families,food selection,jelly cakes,Chinese,friends,dishes,grand opening,egg custard,dishes,tea,food.,setting,sum,places,restaurants,place,stuff,dinner,families,times,in-law,food,mother,mother,reservation,quality,restaurant scene,one,anyone,dishes,reservation,sister,steak,place,names,favorites,dinner,families,advance,steak,fried flounder,type,Shao Mai,mother,dinner menu,dining experience,friends,services,restaurant,VIP rooms,people,food,dinner,times,place,English,family,experience,services,walnut shrimps,things,dimsum,restaurant,place,dinner,time,everything,layout","7,7,2,7,5,7,2,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,4,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,7,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7","0.18026201427,0.154500484467,0.056026943028,0.037282500416,0.037282500416,0.0343873314559,0.0317434482276,0.0275375824422,0.0239308364689,0.0221577044576,0.0221290569752,0.0207420978695,0.0202430151403,0.020185476169,0.0177225954831,0.0160119906068,0.014453003183,0.012381230481,0.0102433664724,0.00786834396422,0.00768006499857,0.00683066807687,0.00681139575318,0.00680318102241,0.00670739589259,0.00645941263065,0.0060897609219,0.00608305400237,0.0060711898841,0.00588541384786,0.00564635917544,0.00564106181264,0.00560198957101,0.00552191352472,0.00549842882901,0.00536591326818,0.0053009246476,0.00515366904438,0.00513111520559,0.0047229770571,0.00469636404887,0.00460919877514,0.00452151848003,0.00451477570459,0.00438343593851,0.00412555225194,0.00410848530009,0.00410153856501,0.00410153856501,0.00410153856501,0.00397243071347,0.00383526063524,0.00375438993797,0.0034864123445,0.0034864123445,0.00348453200422,0.00318364636041,0.00317032937892,0.00304866209626,0.00302593619563,0.00302593619563,0.00285212788731,0.00280458875932,0.00267709931359,0.00255304807797,0.00241011986509,0.00241011986509,0.00240839133039,0.00223528803326,0.00210657482967,0.00202829297632,0.00202433206141,0.00190094741993,0.00181288376916,0.00160157145001,0.00133930693846"

The lady who takes orders for take out is rude and very curt. They had already run out of several dim sum items and it was only 10 am midweek.  I was surprised and dismayed.  Then I took the food home and was horrified at the gelatinous mess I found instead of the delicious steamed noodle and beef dim sum I expected. Their version of Ngow Churng is noodle wrapped around some nasty jello looking meat instead of a nice thin slab of tender beef.  It tasted like noodle and jello flavored with a ramen packet.  The worst Ngow Churng I have ever tasted in my life!!!  I was afraid to give it to my children and had to make an alternate lunch for them!  The last time we visited the department of health was inspecting the kitchen and people were waiting for nearly an hour for a table.  The manager failed to tell any of us who were waiting, starving to death. Again horrible service. No apologies or explanations.  These people obviously don't care about their customers and put questionable ingredients into their food.  It is a disgrace to Chinese culture that they serve this low quality food!  I have had many amazing and delicious meals at Chinese restaurants and with family and friends.  The food and service here are way below par!  I will not be returning to this place again.",1.0 star rating,"Williston Park, NY",2,0,-0.5,12.0,"lady,place,sum,service,location,disgrace,version,Queens,orders,people,children,food home,midweek,items,sum,noodle,noodle,beef,tender beef,jello,people,mess,slab,meat,packet,life,food,food,department of health,kitchen,lunch,Ngow Churng,customers,ingredients,culture,Ngow Churng,food,service,place,meals,restaurants,family,friends,par,manager,Chinese,service,table,death,explanations,apologies,any","1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,3,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,1,2,7,7,4,7,7,7","0.141176089644,0.0958696231246,0.0884518623352,0.0884518623352,0.0707409456372,0.052684597671,0.0442295819521,0.0422126315534,0.0394773706794,0.0357988700271,0.0200856197625,0.0142440553755,0.0138029549271,0.0129576101899,0.0109256310388,0.0109256310388,0.0108792306855,0.00993921048939,0.00991630833596,0.0098969861865,0.00901722628623,0.00869787856936,0.0086778299883,0.0086778299883,0.0086609153077,0.00864628981799,0.00834468286484,0.00793958920985,0.00789078045636,0.0073135481216,0.00613347673789,0.00587471062317,0.0058718174696,0.0058718174696,0.00586668774486,0.00585334096104,0.00514889089391,0.00509685277939,0.00463261827826,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405619805679,0.00402727210894,0.00338823511265,0.00324389967136,0.00258726463653,0.00258413981646,0.00257867202163,0.00257867202163,0.0018349312013"
New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,144509,"The food is great here but the 3 star rating mostly accounts for the cluster f#ck that is Lake Pavilion on any given weekend day/evening/Chinese holiday. The valet parking out back is helpful if you don't mind waiting in a line of cars that wrap around the block just to get in. Flushing seems to attract the most horrible drivers, so beware. Once you get in, waiting for a table after spending 30 minutes parking will be your next fun task. The front area gets so crowded that it is literally a sea of bodies pressed together as steaming hot plates of food pass by (dangerously close to your head). Crowd control doesn't seem to be a priority for the management, they kind of just ignore it. Remember to bring your breath mints, as you will be breathing about 4 inches away from a stranger's face. When you finally do get a table, don't expect too much in terms of good service from the overworked wait staff. That being said, their dim sum is arguably the best in the Flushing. I've been frequenting dim sum joints in the area since I was a little kid, and this place is delicious. I've also had many traditional Chinese banquets here with family and their dishes are really great. Not too salty or greasy. Wouldn't recommend the Peking duck though.

We took the family out for a big family dinner for my dad's birthday celebration back in October and it was a Saturday and we made reservations. But they tell us there will be a wedding and we would be guaranteed a table. But when we got here, it was absolutely hectic. We were sort of ignored until they can get us a table. And when there was a table free, they tell us they can't give us a table because they want to hold it for the wedding party because they weren't sure they were going to fit everyone in the main dining area and may have to seat some of them in the private dining area we were in. This was beyond frustrating since we were hungry and cranky already. I just gave them the birthday cake to put in the refrigerator. Anyways, we ordered banquet style and the food was okay. After everything was in order, I guess it was fine. And they took pictures for us so that was appreciated. The bill was pretty expensive though since we had a large table of people.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,76888,"Okay, so finally I went for dinner... and sorry but it beat out every other cantonese option in Flushing and probably all of NYC. The only reason to go Imperial Palace is for the Dung. Crab, literally Lake Pavillion executed every dish I order at imperial with superior skill. 1. Winter melon soup - 4.3/5, outstanding broth, full of seafood, but would have liked it to be a bit hotter.2. Sauteed Filet of Flounder - 5/5, the fish literally melted in my mouth, it was so soft and full of flavor, it was really enjoyable, it was served over a bed of chinese broccoli and some other veggies which made it very refreshing.3. Salt baked squid - 4.5/5, so lightly fried, it was much less greasier than other restaurants make it, decent sized pieces of squid, extremely tasty and great way to start off the meal. 4. Pan Fried Noodles w/ Beef - 5/5, this might actually be my favorite food on earth, if I was forced to eat one thing for every meal for the rest of my life, it might just be this. I first ate pan fried noodles as a real young buck at East Lake (former restaurant of the owners of Lake Pavilion) about 15 years ago. Since East Lake closed, it was extremely hard to find any restaurant that made this dish anywhere near as good. Imperial's version is not bad, nor is Jade Asian's- even the place on 38th ave does a decent job... but lets face it, Lake Pavilion's version blows everyone else out of the water, perfectly crispy noodles, their sauce could not have been more on point - it was not too starchy but had the perfect thickness to it. Fresh broccoli and delicious beef, perfectly executed.5. Peking Pork Chops - 5/5, I have never in my life had such a juicy and meaty version of Peking Pork chops, even when Silver Pond was still around (used to be at the corner of main and booth memorial across from the hospital and killed this dish), the pork chops were not soaked in sauce like some restaurants do, but rather perfectly glazed, lightly fried, so you could actually taste the sauce and the meat and it was truly a pleasure. As for the service, the lady who waited on us, told us she recognized us from Dim Sum a week ago, she was very pleasant and took really good care of us. I actually felt that the service was much better than any other Chinese restaurant in Flushing, as the service was broken down into different parts, it wasn't the same guy with an upset face bringing you every dish, interesting for such an establishment.

SERIOUSLY? If your shrimp ain't fresh now it's not gonna be fresh later.They had soup dumplings too but they were made in these WEIRD tin cups..Kinda like cupcake cups.

Within the past years, I noticed that this restaurant always comes up with new dishes and a several weeks later other major Flushing Chinese restaurants would copy and promote the same dishes on their wall.  High score for originality.-Unlike the Chinese seafood/dim sum restaurants by Roosevelt Ave., this place is more convenient for the folks who do not desire to commute into an overcrowded Flushing area.  The parking lot is a tad small, but there is street parking if you don't mind walking 1-5 min for free street parking.-But that is not to say that this restaurant is not busy.  In fact, it is always packed whenever I go.  Over the weekend, it is like waiting for a new Apple iPhone! but worth the wait.  Call ahead of time to reserve for the VIP rooms.  Their soup is excellent.",5.0 star rating,"Jamaica, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,6.90000009537,"food critic,one,restaurant,restaurant,East Coast,food menu,edge,dishes,folks,sum,places,restaurants,food,dinner,wedding,dim sum restaurants,place,dishes,West Coast,blogger,menu list,atmosphere,wall,score,originality.,seafood,street parking.,Chinese,fact,soup,Roosevelt Ave.,wait,VIP rooms,street parking,parking lot,area,iPhone,Apple,Flushing","1,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,7,4,4,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,2,2,6,3,2","0.49769115448,0.186334744096,0.0537021011114,0.0499676801264,0.0258403345942,0.023290688172,0.0133369639516,0.0125187793747,0.0108112646267,0.00873046647757,0.00797361880541,0.00721187982708,0.00717479223385,0.00695526367053,0.00695526367053,0.00611118087545,0.0059570944868,0.0048738354817,0.00472998572513,0.00468816515058,0.00467737019062,0.00467737019062,0.00426557520404,0.00425922591239,0.00425922591239,0.00425922591239,0.00399396708235,0.00329848239198,0.00317567796446,0.00268318434246,0.00252367276698,0.00219497014768,0.00219291052781,0.00214777537622,0.00170930684544,0.00139743543696,0.00130104681011,0.00130104681011,0.000827270909213"

They served a variety of seafood dishes from different styles of shrimps to fish to squid to lobster to black snail (or whatever you call them) to jellyfish and other stuff i dont have the courage to try. They also serve this steak that had too much sauce on it (had to remove some) that tastes slightly of oyster sauce and my mom told me later that it had red wine on it which worried me a bit but it came with waffle fries so i was happy. Although it was not as impressive, there was this humungous bowl of fried rice using sticky rice and snow crabs. There was also supposed to be quail but they ran out :(This restaurant actually serves dessert which most chinese restaurants dont do, they serve this sweet red bean soup and orange slices, not sure if they have anything else, probably do though.All in all, i like this restaurant and it is somewhere that one should visit with their family and/or friends.",4.0 star rating,"Roselle, NJ",2,1,0.20000000298,4.19999980927,"sum,times,visit,cousins,queens,family,steak,place,place,dinner,restaurants,whatever,dessert,wedding,reason,one,food,wedding,party,restaurant,restaurant,restaurants,stuff,sum,food,dinner,chinese,variety,stuff,sauce,chinatown,shrimps,styles,seafood dishes,snail,jellyfish,squid,lobster,courage,some,quail,fried rice,rice,red wine,birthday parties,bowl,snow crabs,restaurant,Golden Unicorn,friends,family,all,red bean soup,slices,anything,somewhere,oyster sauce,waffle fries,mom,bit","7,7,4,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,4,4,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,6,7,2,3,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7","0.101740337908,0.071849167347,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0603131093085,0.0477837212384,0.044764071703,0.036592900753,0.0344087556005,0.0311959329993,0.0178562067449,0.0173321869224,0.0161993801594,0.0136993806809,0.0134591246024,0.0133624058217,0.0131130144,0.0125432731584,0.0122807892039,0.011055259034,0.011055259034,0.0108880344778,0.00967406202108,0.00925707165152,0.00877955462784,0.0084856627509,0.00806567631662,0.00801903102547,0.00800548028201,0.00769994547591,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00700470944867,0.00639211945236,0.00597295444459,0.00597295444459,0.00585166178644,0.00566414510831,0.00556785101071,0.0052926284261,0.00519023369998,0.00455954391509,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00380151346326,0.00361353135668,0.00361353135668,0.00276877917349,0.00262401113287,0.00262401113287,0.0022956347093,0.0022956347093"

The ambiance is very nice and the air conditioning is superb but the kitchen staff prepared and made the food too fast. We had two tables and the first dish came out as expected, our appetizer the regular jellyfish, beef, pork, cured meat with pickled vegetables), then our next dish was lobster.We thought that was odd but sure, why not? Lobster is usually dish #5 and it came out as #2. Then, our fish came out as dish #3 which was supposed to be dish #6 came out. Fish should never be eaten cold, it should always be eaten hot-warm. When we tooka bite, it was nearing warm-cold which meant the fish had been prepared and was likely sitting in the kitchen before being brought out. Then, then square fried tofu came out which was supposed to be dish #2. When all of us grabbed one, 10 minutes later the sauce came...too late. Sheesh, talk about timing. Our entrees were all out of sync and the dishes did not come out one by one, it came out 2 at once or even 3 at once. Least to say, we were not pleased by the out of sync orders. We're not paying chump change here, we're paying a good premium and expect premium service. Lake Pavillion manager, step up your game. Your parking lot is way too small, we parked in Guam -- at least get the food right. Just disappointed at how service went last night. Other than that, food was good but we've had better.

I have been here a few times but only for dim sum and I am pretty happy with everything I have had. I don't speak Chinese so phonetic or English it is.The food:Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll- this will always be my fav dish because I love it and it makes me think of my dad. The crepe is nicely made, it's neither too thick nor too thin and the shrimp inside is prepared well.Pie Qhat- these are steamed spare ribs and these were excellent. I would say these are one of the best versions I have had. There were so tender, juicy and had nice fat content.Chicken Feet- The chicken feet were prepared well and then they give a ton of boiled peanuts. I thought this dish was good.Pork Shumai- these were really good. The pork they used wasn't finely minced like other places, it was more like pork chunks that was held together with the wrapper. I really enjoyed these. Don tot- Egg tarts. I really liked the version here. I like texture and the shell was super crispy and the filling was nice and rich. Xiao Long Bao- Soup Dumplings. I was kinda surprised to see these here since I don't think of these as Dim Sum items but these were respectable. I thought the dough was nice and the filling was good. I would get them again.Fish Balls- I thought these were good, they are kinda a staple Dim Sum dish and they were made well. The fish balls were tender and had a nice mild flavor.Law Bock Gow- Turnip cake- This is not an exciting dish but I like it when it is not greasy.

So they cater towards getting the most people in when they can, which means tables of 4 and 2 get in faster. Once we got seated, they took forever to take our order so we had to flag down the waiter, who ended up not doing anything. Once we flagged down another waiter he took our order. Ended up waiting over 30 minutes before even getting our first dish. 1 dish got ""sold out"" so we scratched it from our order and another dish we would have to wait a long time so we never ordered it. But seeing as how we waited for the rest of our food for so long, we could have ordered it.They have really large portions. We got the walnut shrimp with fried milk, vegetable dish, one of the signature rice dishes (Dungeness crab on sticky rice), flounder, and chicken. The walnut shrimp is slightly on the sweet side.

We ordered peking duck and only got a few slices of meat! The peking porkchop was very tough, the fish soup was bland, fried flounder was way too salty, and the salt pepper squid was really chewy. Chow mein (crispy noodles) was okay, though it seems hard to mess up.The service was horrible.  They brought the wrong dishes to our table twice, and stood awkwardly over our table trying to figure out where they were supposed to go. Our fried tofu didn't come to the table until after we finished the rest of the food. My aunt asked our waiter where it was and he said it takes a while to steam. We said we ordered fried, not steamed, and he said he wrote down steamed, then proceeded to blame my aunt for ordering incorrectly.  We wanted to cancel the dish and he just walked away.Overall, my advice is to skip this place and go somewhere else unless you enjoy bad food, rude service, and long waits.

To top it off, they would not accept our credit card because we ordered two dim sum dishes as part of our meal. Mind you, our total bill was nearly $250. Because of two dishes that totaled $10, they would not accept credit card. WHAT. THE. HECK? What kind of lame excuse of a policy is that? Let's call a spade a spade, ladies and gentlemen. When establishments like this see a credit card, they cower in fear over the merchant fees associated with it. I get it, you're a business and it cuts into profits. You know how businesses deal with that? They just don't accept it. Cash only. Boom, simple as that. If you can't deal with merchant fees, why bother accepting credit cards in the first place? Why ruin an otherwise already lackluster meal with stupid made up policies like this? I should have just sat there at the table, card in hand, until they gave up. That way, we'll see what they like better, a table being taken up on a busy day, or sucking up and taking a 1-2% merchant fee.Speaking of stupid policies and rules, they state that parking is free but you have to tip $2. Like, you HAVE to or else your keys are withheld. Valet parking should always be tipped, but its also up to the driver to tip how much.

We ordered peking duck and only got a few slices of meat! The peking porkchop was very tough, the fish soup was bland, fried flounder was way too salty, and the salt pepper squid was really chewy. Chow mein (crispy noodles) was okay, though it seems hard to mess up.The service was horrible.  They brought the wrong dishes to our table twice, and stood awkwardly over our table trying to figure out where they were supposed to go. Our fried tofu didn't come to the table until after we finished the rest of the food. My aunt asked our waiter where it was and he said it takes a while to steam. We said we ordered fried, not steamed, and he said he wrote down steamed, then proceeded to blame my aunt for ordering incorrectly.  We wanted to cancel the dish and he just walked away.Overall, my advice is to skip this place and go somewhere else unless you enjoy bad food, rude service, and long waits.

We ordered peking duck and only got a few slices of meat! The peking porkchop was very tough, the fish soup was bland, fried flounder was way too salty, and the salt pepper squid was really chewy. Chow mein (crispy noodles) was okay, though it seems hard to mess up.The service was horrible.  They brought the wrong dishes to our table twice, and stood awkwardly over our table trying to figure out where they were supposed to go. Our fried tofu didn't come to the table until after we finished the rest of the food. My aunt asked our waiter where it was and he said it takes a while to steam. We said we ordered fried, not steamed, and he said he wrote down steamed, then proceeded to blame my aunt for ordering incorrectly.  We wanted to cancel the dish and he just walked away.Overall, my advice is to skip this place and go somewhere else unless you enjoy bad food, rude service, and long waits.

Our table was set up for us and there was a very short wait time. However, the table was not properly cleaned - we found sauces and unknown bits of food staining the cloth and underneath our glasses. Never mind that obvious overlook. We finally get to ordering - around 8-9 dishes. A 40 minute wait ensues, and when we finally begin receiving our dishes, they are dead cold, and only vegetables. They brought our appetizer - a seafood soup - after a few vegetables, on a PLATE. Why? Why would you do that? Is it not logical to put liquids in a bowl? Needless to say, it was a terrible mess. The entire time while we were eating, the manager was shouting around us. Finally, after around 20 minutes of us just attempting to enjoy our food, he marches over to our table and demand that we hurry to finish because they have a time limit on tables. He then proceeds to argue with my dad over dishes and finally leans over, grabs our check and menu, and vehemently crosses out any dish we had not received thus far (around 4-5). We were then literally KICKED OUT of the restaurant with him shouting that the other family could now take our seats. It was over $300, and we ate 3 plates of boiled vegetables and 1 PLATE of soup. Give me a break. That's no way to treat a customer, even if it's Chinese New Year. The lobby was crowded with families and as we walked out, there were exasperated sighs of ""Oh, finally, another table"". Seriously.

interesting, ""authentic"" (if you're into that kinda thing) and well prepared.  However, you don't eat at Lake Pavillion for the service or ambiance unless you are a masochist.  The bright purple tablecloths and pink ribbons around the chairs almost made me feel like I was eating in a doll house.  Every 10 minutes or so they would blast a happy birthday song at extreme levels, with no apparent relation to anyone actually celebrating a birthday in the restaurant at the time that we could see.  We just learned to avoid conversation until the 3rd chorus came around and the end of the song was near...   After we ordered, the waiter, who was very patient and friendly, took about 5 minutes to hover over our table and write out the check before bringing it to the kitchen, occasionally re-asking us what we ordered.  After the food arrived, one server stood in front of our table for a bit too long and watched my father's own style of adding a bit of rice into his peaking duck steamed buns with amazement.  Despite those occasional awkward moments, and their tendency to linger,  the staff was very friendly and helpful with menu suggestions.  Better service than more places I've eaten in this area.  I've eaten here about 5 times about the food is always excellent and the portions huge.  My father loved the sweet and sour pork.  The Peking duck was well browned, crispy, and after the breast was sliced they brought the rest of the animal back in small pieces to chew at the small tender bits of duck meat around the bones.  The seafood soup with vegetables was very good, a stronger, deeper flavor broth that I usually get with this dish at other restaurants, the squid was exceptionally tender, the shrimp not over cooked.  The shrimp with honey walnuts was great although a bit too indulgent for me.  It is a plate full of fried food, so its understandable quite heavy.  I finished about half and was very satisfied.  The beautiful tender rectangles of sweet fried condensed milk are simply amazing, although i'm not sure I needed a third fried item on the plate.  Steamed flounder is perfect and deboned properly table side.  Crispy fried small fish are delicious and crunchy.  Fried rice with salmon is umami, just a tad fishy, and very comforting.  One of the best dishes they serve is the Triple Crispy (Shrimp, Scallop and Squid) which is fried, salt and pepper style.  Perfect fried fish, not too salty, the squid still tender, the shrimp retaining their flavor as the are cooked in the shell, served with crispy shallots and peppers this dish is highly recommended.  The complementary sweet tofu skin soup dessert we were served once was a great warm ending to a nice meal.  I really love this place.  The quality and preparation of the food far outweighs any awkwardness on the part of the staff.  Prices were fair, portions were huge, definitely recommended!",4.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS,

If you like chinese food and want to hold a party or want to eat at a place that serves more authentic food than typical chinese restaurants, this is your place to go.I personally like the dim sum in the Golden Unicorn restaurant in another ny chinatown, but the dim sum here is good. What i do like, is the stuff they serve for dinner, or at least what we order. They served a variety of seafood dishes from different styles of shrimps to fish to squid to lobster to black snail (or whatever you call them) to jellyfish and other stuff i dont have the courage to try. They also serve this steak that had too much sauce on it (had to remove some) that tastes slightly of oyster sauce and my mom told me later that it had red wine on it which worried me a bit but it came with waffle fries so i was happy. Although it was not as impressive, there was this humungous bowl of fried rice using sticky rice and snow crabs. There was also supposed to be quail but they ran out :(This restaurant actually serves dessert which most chinese restaurants dont do, they serve this sweet red bean soup and orange slices, not sure if they have anything else, probably do though.All in all, i like this restaurant and it is somewhere that one should visit with their family and/or friends.",4.0 star rating,"Roselle, NJ",2,1,0.20000000298,4.19999980927,"sum,times,visit,cousins,queens,family,steak,place,place,dinner,restaurants,whatever,dessert,wedding,reason,one,food,wedding,party,restaurant,restaurant,restaurants,stuff,sum,food,dinner,chinese,variety,stuff,sauce,chinatown,shrimps,styles,seafood dishes,snail,jellyfish,squid,lobster,courage,some,quail,fried rice,rice,red wine,birthday parties,bowl,snow crabs,restaurant,Golden Unicorn,friends,family,all,red bean soup,slices,anything,somewhere,oyster sauce,waffle fries,mom,bit","7,7,4,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,4,4,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,6,7,2,3,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7","0.101740337908,0.071849167347,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0629801899195,0.0603131093085,0.0477837212384,0.044764071703,0.036592900753,0.0344087556005,0.0311959329993,0.0178562067449,0.0173321869224,0.0161993801594,0.0136993806809,0.0134591246024,0.0133624058217,0.0131130144,0.0125432731584,0.0122807892039,0.011055259034,0.011055259034,0.0108880344778,0.00967406202108,0.00925707165152,0.00877955462784,0.0084856627509,0.00806567631662,0.00801903102547,0.00800548028201,0.00769994547591,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00766719738021,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00701656937599,0.00700470944867,0.00639211945236,0.00597295444459,0.00597295444459,0.00585166178644,0.00566414510831,0.00556785101071,0.0052926284261,0.00519023369998,0.00455954391509,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00413025030866,0.00380151346326,0.00361353135668,0.00361353135668,0.00276877917349,0.00262401113287,0.00262401113287,0.0022956347093,0.0022956347093"

They advertise expensive food around the restaurant. I saw soup prices near the bathrooms and the exit to the parking lot. My aunt reserved more than half the restaurant for her wedding celebration. There wasn't as much staff to a table as in the private room, and they seemed rushed. They kept asking us if we needed help dividing the food. I kept saying no, but they eventually started dividing it. I heard another waitress tell the one who was assigned to my table to hurry up and go get the other food.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,48947,"I had dinner at this very large restaurant off the LIE (Long Island Expressway) last evening, July 25th with a large group of women attending a conference at Queens College. We were two large tables of 11 each and a small table of three. This was an experience that will be talked about for years to come. Not because of the food, but for the bizarre and ultimately distressing service.Each person ordered individually, which I understand is not the custom, but most of the group were from out of town and on various diets, so this seemed to be the way to go. Each order was taken, and the ticket laid by each plate. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. To be fair, an order of Peking duck arrived almost immediately and was shared at one table. One order of shrimp dumplings arrived after that. My order of shrimp & vegetable dumplings never arrived; I accepted an order of shrimp dumplings instead. This arrived 20 minutes after the first shrimp dumplings. Efforts to talk to the servers met with smiles and gestures and no food. A captain finally came over, and told us the food was coming. Meanwhile an hour after we ordered, the restaurant was full and everyone was eating but us. The small table of three people, who arrived late (because it took them 40 minutes to park the car as the small valet parking lot was full) was served promptly. A bowl of hot and sour soup, ordered by my friend, finally arrived after much complaining and had to be sent back, it was ice cold. My friend's main dish order--fish--only arrived as we were paying the bill, in other words, over 90 minutes after it was ordered. She did not go home hungry--we all shared the dishes that did finally arrive--but she was extremely disappointed and angry as she had been looking forward to this meal for a week. The few dishes that did arrive were very good. But, because the atmosphere had changed from happy expectation to anger and frustration, it was hard to enjoy them. Also, we were surprised that rice had to be ordered separately. This is not acceptable in a restaurant that is already overcharging. And, in our case, the rice did not arrive till we were finished with our food! I would never go to this restaurant again. I thought it significant that our two tables that did not get food were the only tables in the restaurant with no Asian people. Is this a requirement at Lake Pavilion? This was a very embarrassing experience for those of us who were hosting this group. We wanted to show them the great Chinese cuisine Queens had to offer. Instead, we gave them a miserable, hungry experience.",1.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,12.8000001907,"conference,tables,experience,restaurant,group,LIE,women,dinner,restaurant,table,Long Island Expressway,Queens College,shrimp dumplings,friend,dish order,tables,people,experience,order,food,group,custom,way,restaurant,table,order,order,order,order,table,diets,person,town,plate,food,food,vegetable dumplings,shrimp,shrimp dumplings,servers,captain,dishes,valet parking lot,friend,duck,gestures,smiles,Efforts,everyone,car,group,food,ice cold,ticket,complaining,bowl,soup,words,bill,fish,food,rice,rice,case,most,experience,Peking,requirement,people,cuisine,dishes,expectation,Queens,atmosphere,meal,home,frustration,anger,Asian,Lake Pavilion,Chinese","4,7,7,2,3,7,1,4,2,7,2,3,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,3,7,1,7,4,6,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2","0.0870825201273,0.0735579654574,0.0709865614772,0.0589113309979,0.0516420714557,0.0412076599896,0.0412076599896,0.0412076599896,0.0299776867032,0.0296789575368,0.0244996678084,0.0244996678084,0.0227258782834,0.0209571514279,0.0173917934299,0.015680398792,0.0144056780264,0.0132228499278,0.0112419398502,0.010716390796,0.00937814917415,0.00925765186548,0.00914122257382,0.00849870499223,0.00753739476204,0.00753739476204,0.00752734579146,0.00751826679334,0.00751826679334,0.00748268142343,0.0074651222676,0.0074651222676,0.0074651222676,0.0074440590106,0.00713112065569,0.00712443143129,0.00672983471304,0.00672983471304,0.00672242231667,0.00567572750151,0.00549068953842,0.00545752281323,0.00541239930317,0.00517641240731,0.00498926825821,0.00496607460082,0.00496607460082,0.00496607460082,0.00495707802474,0.00495302584022,0.00491938786581,0.00483878375962,0.00482536945492,0.00459989812225,0.00452911062166,0.00452911062166,0.00452911062166,0.00452583096921,0.00452583096921,0.00452583096921,0.0043128314428,0.00410719076172,0.00385072827339,0.00336904427968,0.00323476898484,0.00314614060335,0.00295401411131,0.00288926321082,0.00266338931397,0.00232690689154,0.00205494277179,0.00200214702636,0.0016773911193,0.00151806604117,0.00148192117922,0.00148192117922,0.00148004118819,0.00148004118819,0.00137918896507,0.00137852900662,0.00137727998663"

No.I head over there and it was lunch time. Place was crowded but we were seated right away as we were just a party of 2. We sat down and was very happy with the ambiance and how the good the place looks. The dim sum carts started to stroll around. Two of the carts that I like finally came around. First cart was the tripe cart and I odered that. Then the classic strimp dumpling and pork dumpling cart. Both of the ladies bought the food to the table at the same time. They marked my card and then I ordered one more dish from the second lady. She came back to the table and marked my card again.I caught her as she was trying to go for the 3rd stamp... again! She looks up and argues with me and said that she didn't stamp my card. With attitude she said well what did you eat before? I pointed out to her that there are only 4 dishes on the table and our plates and utensils are clean cause we just sat down. She finally realized that she messed up. I told her thats ok but just have someone void out the extra 2 stamps. She turns around and tell the waiter behind what happened and he comes back refusing to void the stamps because it causes confusion. They said just order food of the same value and it'll even out. They go about with their job leaving us frustrated and confused. How would the next person come along and know that we've already been stamped? Finally, I waved done the supervisors and explained to him what happened and what our concerns are. He voided the 2 stamps but he was not happy. Not one apology from anyone of them. We went about eating and this is what ended our lunch then and there. We ordered a plate of green vegetables and 2 pieces in..and we find a huge worm! That grossed us out and we had to leave. We lost our appetites and wondered about how the prepared the food. If they cleaned the items properly. Waved down another supervisor and voided that plate too. Paid the bill and left. All they kept doing is try to cover up. The dim sum lady just kept bring me stuff that I don't want trying to cover her mistakes.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,147007,"This is a convenient location for dim sum due to it's location outside of the busy and congested downtown Flushing area. It's right off the LIE highway on exit 23. It was formally Palace Diner for a number of years. There is valet parking behind the restaurant, as well as parking in front and on the streets. Both times I've been here, the wait time has been short despite it usually being packed. As with most dim sum restaurants, expect to be potentially seated with other people at the same table. Ask for the chrysanthemum tea, which is lighter and sweeter than the usual black tea that's served in Chinese restaurants. Dim sum carts are constantly going around so you're never short of waiting for food to come. Just tell the cart ladies what you want or point to it. There is staff that occasionally comes by to change out your plate for a clean one and bring you another fresh pot of tea. Service is quick and on point.

The parking lot was full, but I found parking on the street. As soon as I stepped inside, it was pretty chaotic.Now, I've been to plenty of dim sum places, and they are usually chaotic, with the shouting of numbers and hungry people swarming the hostess. But that's a controlled chaos. Here, it was just chaotic. The hostess was situated sort of in the middle of the front, where people were coming at her from the front door AND the back where the parking lot entrance was. Then she had who I am assuming was her superior yelling at her, basically saying ""what the heck are you doing, give the larger group the table, not have 3 parties share!"". This superior came to yell at the hostess at least 3 times while I was waiting for a table - 15 minutes.When my boyfriend and I were seated, we ended up sharing the table with a party of 3, which was fine. They set plates in front of us and eventually brought the tea, and then a couple of food carts came by. That's when we - all 5 of us - realized they forgot to bring us chopsticks.It didn't take very long for them to rectify the situation, and we ordered a couple of dishes from the 2 carts. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. This place is pretty big, so I was surprised to find that there were only FOUR carts rolling, and they were going so slow. We ended up ordering something from the kitchen instead of waiting for the carts to reach us.  And when they did, the selections were pretty basic. Nothing special, and everything tasted fine. Again, nothing special. What we got from the kitchen, though - pan fried noodles with shredded pork - was excellent.I would not come here again. It was out of the way and pretty ordinary overall.

The Chinese name of this place, ""Dong Yun Ge"" is of a very good Chinese restaurant that used to be at Franklin Ave. and Main St. I think it's because it named itself ""East Lake"" that the restaurant was able to create a buzz for itself. (When it first opened, it attracted a lot of attention from the Chinese community)First off the renovation from the old Palace Diner, which was what this restaurant used to be before it became this restaurant. Not too much has changed on the outside of the restaurant except that they stuck on the ugly restaurant signage and tacky LED lights. The inside of the restaurant however is a hot mess. Other dim sum restaurants like Asian Jewels, Jade Asian and East are tastefully decorated/renovated. Here the inside is a mismatch of ugly wood, weird marble pillars, ugly carpeting, ugly chandeliers and a huge bright LED sign over at their dragon and phoenix wall. It shocks me as to how they were able to change such a beautiful diner like Palace Diner into this particular monstrosity.I ordered the usual dim sum foods that I would at any other dim sum restaurant and it's hands down terrible. The ngau pak yi (Beef tripe) was overly tender, the congee didn't taste good, the cheong fun was blah and their fried rice tasted like white rice with yellow food coloring.Overall, this place is ugly to sit in, the food isn't good and parking costs $2 (Though, to be fair all dim sum restaurant require you to pay $2 for parking. Here, they've put up a sign in Chinese that says that $2 tips are compulsory) and you have to park the car yourself.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,76888,"Okay, so finally I went for dinner... and sorry but it beat out every other cantonese option in Flushing and probably all of NYC. The only reason to go Imperial Palace is for the Dung. Crab, literally Lake Pavillion executed every dish I order at imperial with superior skill. 1. Winter melon soup - 4.3/5, outstanding broth, full of seafood, but would have liked it to be a bit hotter.2. Sauteed Filet of Flounder - 5/5, the fish literally melted in my mouth, it was so soft and full of flavor, it was really enjoyable, it was served over a bed of chinese broccoli and some other veggies which made it very refreshing.3. Salt baked squid - 4.5/5, so lightly fried, it was much less greasier than other restaurants make it, decent sized pieces of squid, extremely tasty and great way to start off the meal. 4. Pan Fried Noodles w/ Beef - 5/5, this might actually be my favorite food on earth, if I was forced to eat one thing for every meal for the rest of my life, it might just be this. I first ate pan fried noodles as a real young buck at East Lake (former restaurant of the owners of Lake Pavilion) about 15 years ago. Since East Lake closed, it was extremely hard to find any restaurant that made this dish anywhere near as good. Imperial's version is not bad, nor is Jade Asian's- even the place on 38th ave does a decent job... but lets face it, Lake Pavilion's version blows everyone else out of the water, perfectly crispy noodles, their sauce could not have been more on point - it was not too starchy but had the perfect thickness to it. Fresh broccoli and delicious beef, perfectly executed.5. Peking Pork Chops - 5/5, I have never in my life had such a juicy and meaty version of Peking Pork chops, even when Silver Pond was still around (used to be at the corner of main and booth memorial across from the hospital and killed this dish), the pork chops were not soaked in sauce like some restaurants do, but rather perfectly glazed, lightly fried, so you could actually taste the sauce and the meat and it was truly a pleasure. As for the service, the lady who waited on us, told us she recognized us from Dim Sum a week ago, she was very pleasant and took really good care of us. I actually felt that the service was much better than any other Chinese restaurant in Flushing, as the service was broken down into different parts, it wasn't the same guy with an upset face bringing you every dish, interesting for such an establishment.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,48947,"I had dinner at this very large restaurant off the LIE (Long Island Expressway) last evening, July 25th with a large group of women attending a conference at Queens College. We were two large tables of 11 each and a small table of three. This was an experience that will be talked about for years to come. Not because of the food, but for the bizarre and ultimately distressing service.Each person ordered individually, which I understand is not the custom, but most of the group were from out of town and on various diets, so this seemed to be the way to go. Each order was taken, and the ticket laid by each plate. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. To be fair, an order of Peking duck arrived almost immediately and was shared at one table. One order of shrimp dumplings arrived after that. My order of shrimp & vegetable dumplings never arrived; I accepted an order of shrimp dumplings instead. This arrived 20 minutes after the first shrimp dumplings. Efforts to talk to the servers met with smiles and gestures and no food. A captain finally came over, and told us the food was coming. Meanwhile an hour after we ordered, the restaurant was full and everyone was eating but us. The small table of three people, who arrived late (because it took them 40 minutes to park the car as the small valet parking lot was full) was served promptly. A bowl of hot and sour soup, ordered by my friend, finally arrived after much complaining and had to be sent back, it was ice cold. My friend's main dish order--fish--only arrived as we were paying the bill, in other words, over 90 minutes after it was ordered. She did not go home hungry--we all shared the dishes that did finally arrive--but she was extremely disappointed and angry as she had been looking forward to this meal for a week. The few dishes that did arrive were very good. But, because the atmosphere had changed from happy expectation to anger and frustration, it was hard to enjoy them. Also, we were surprised that rice had to be ordered separately. This is not acceptable in a restaurant that is already overcharging. And, in our case, the rice did not arrive till we were finished with our food! I would never go to this restaurant again. I thought it significant that our two tables that did not get food were the only tables in the restaurant with no Asian people. Is this a requirement at Lake Pavilion? This was a very embarrassing experience for those of us who were hosting this group. We wanted to show them the great Chinese cuisine Queens had to offer. Instead, we gave them a miserable, hungry experience.",1.0 star rating,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,12.8000001907,"conference,tables,experience,restaurant,group,LIE,women,dinner,restaurant,table,Long Island Expressway,Queens College,shrimp dumplings,friend,dish order,tables,people,experience,order,food,group,custom,way,restaurant,table,order,order,order,order,table,diets,person,town,plate,food,food,vegetable dumplings,shrimp,shrimp dumplings,servers,captain,dishes,valet parking lot,friend,duck,gestures,smiles,Efforts,everyone,car,group,food,ice cold,ticket,complaining,bowl,soup,words,bill,fish,food,rice,rice,case,most,experience,Peking,requirement,people,cuisine,dishes,expectation,Queens,atmosphere,meal,home,frustration,anger,Asian,Lake Pavilion,Chinese","4,7,7,2,3,7,1,4,2,7,2,3,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,3,7,1,7,4,6,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,2","0.0870825201273,0.0735579654574,0.0709865614772,0.0589113309979,0.0516420714557,0.0412076599896,0.0412076599896,0.0412076599896,0.0299776867032,0.0296789575368,0.0244996678084,0.0244996678084,0.0227258782834,0.0209571514279,0.0173917934299,0.015680398792,0.0144056780264,0.0132228499278,0.0112419398502,0.010716390796,0.00937814917415,0.00925765186548,0.00914122257382,0.00849870499223,0.00753739476204,0.00753739476204,0.00752734579146,0.00751826679334,0.00751826679334,0.00748268142343,0.0074651222676,0.0074651222676,0.0074651222676,0.0074440590106,0.00713112065569,0.00712443143129,0.00672983471304,0.00672983471304,0.00672242231667,0.00567572750151,0.00549068953842,0.00545752281323,0.00541239930317,0.00517641240731,0.00498926825821,0.00496607460082,0.00496607460082,0.00496607460082,0.00495707802474,0.00495302584022,0.00491938786581,0.00483878375962,0.00482536945492,0.00459989812225,0.00452911062166,0.00452911062166,0.00452911062166,0.00452583096921,0.00452583096921,0.00452583096921,0.0043128314428,0.00410719076172,0.00385072827339,0.00336904427968,0.00323476898484,0.00314614060335,0.00295401411131,0.00288926321082,0.00266338931397,0.00232690689154,0.00205494277179,0.00200214702636,0.0016773911193,0.00151806604117,0.00148192117922,0.00148192117922,0.00148004118819,0.00148004118819,0.00137918896507,0.00137852900662,0.00137727998663"

First cart was the tripe cart and I odered that. Then the classic strimp dumpling and pork dumpling cart. Both of the ladies bought the food to the table at the same time. They marked my card and then I ordered one more dish from the second lady. She came back to the table and marked my card again.I caught her as she was trying to go for the 3rd stamp... again! She looks up and argues with me and said that she didn't stamp my card. With attitude she said well what did you eat before? I pointed out to her that there are only 4 dishes on the table and our plates and utensils are clean cause we just sat down. She finally realized that she messed up. I told her thats ok but just have someone void out the extra 2 stamps. She turns around and tell the waiter behind what happened and he comes back refusing to void the stamps because it causes confusion. They said just order food of the same value and it'll even out. They go about with their job leaving us frustrated and confused. How would the next person come along and know that we've already been stamped? Finally, I waved done the supervisors and explained to him what happened and what our concerns are. He voided the 2 stamps but he was not happy. Not one apology from anyone of them. We went about eating and this is what ended our lunch then and there. We ordered a plate of green vegetables and 2 pieces in..and we find a huge worm! That grossed us out and we had to leave. We lost our appetites and wondered about how the prepared the food. If they cleaned the items properly. Waved down another supervisor and voided that plate too. Paid the bill and left.

At other places they where masks because they spit. The food was okay though.When we came for CNY Eve Dinner that was different. It was crowded and it was Super Bowl Sunday. The people in my party had repeatedly asked if they could broadcast the game but they said no. I guess it was because they didn't want anyone to just stay and watch the game and wanted a constant flow of people going out and coming in. The food wasn't that good though compared to other places.

Their version of Ngow Churng is noodle wrapped around some nasty jello looking meat instead of a nice thin slab of tender beef.  It tasted like noodle and jello flavored with a ramen packet.  The worst Ngow Churng I have ever tasted in my life!!!  I was afraid to give it to my children and had to make an alternate lunch for them!  The last time we visited the department of health was inspecting the kitchen and people were waiting for nearly an hour for a table.  The manager failed to tell any of us who were waiting, starving to death. Again horrible service. No apologies or explanations.  These people obviously don't care about their customers and put questionable ingredients into their food.  It is a disgrace to Chinese culture that they serve this low quality food!  I have had many amazing and delicious meals at Chinese restaurants and with family and friends.  The food and service here are way below par!  I will not be returning to this place again.",1.0 star rating,"Williston Park, NY",2,0,-0.5,12.0,"lady,place,sum,service,location,disgrace,version,Queens,orders,people,children,food home,midweek,items,sum,noodle,noodle,beef,tender beef,jello,people,mess,slab,meat,packet,life,food,food,department of health,kitchen,lunch,Ngow Churng,customers,ingredients,culture,Ngow Churng,food,service,place,meals,restaurants,family,friends,par,manager,Chinese,service,table,death,explanations,apologies,any","1,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,3,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,1,2,7,7,4,7,7,7","0.141176089644,0.0958696231246,0.0884518623352,0.0884518623352,0.0707409456372,0.052684597671,0.0442295819521,0.0422126315534,0.0394773706794,0.0357988700271,0.0200856197625,0.0142440553755,0.0138029549271,0.0129576101899,0.0109256310388,0.0109256310388,0.0108792306855,0.00993921048939,0.00991630833596,0.0098969861865,0.00901722628623,0.00869787856936,0.0086778299883,0.0086778299883,0.0086609153077,0.00864628981799,0.00834468286484,0.00793958920985,0.00789078045636,0.0073135481216,0.00613347673789,0.00587471062317,0.0058718174696,0.0058718174696,0.00586668774486,0.00585334096104,0.00514889089391,0.00509685277939,0.00463261827826,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405931565911,0.00405619805679,0.00402727210894,0.00338823511265,0.00324389967136,0.00258726463653,0.00258413981646,0.00257867202163,0.00257867202163,0.0018349312013"

I have been here a few times to dim sum. There's always a wait and the wait area gets so crowded. And when you finally get a seat, you wait for the ladies to push around the dim sum carts so you can get food. The food is okay. It's not bad and it's not great. I can never really review dim sum because I feel like it's the same everywhere. Onto a special occasion. We took the family out for a big family dinner for my dad's birthday celebration back in October and it was a Saturday and we made reservations. But they tell us there will be a wedding and we would be guaranteed a table. But when we got here, it was absolutely hectic. We were sort of ignored until they can get us a table. And when there was a table free, they tell us they can't give us a table because they want to hold it for the wedding party because they weren't sure they were going to fit everyone in the main dining area and may have to seat some of them in the private dining area we were in. This was beyond frustrating since we were hungry and cranky already. I just gave them the birthday cake to put in the refrigerator. Anyways, we ordered banquet style and the food was okay. After everything was in order, I guess it was fine. And they took pictures for us so that was appreciated. The bill was pretty expensive though since we had a large table of people.

Needless to say, Palace held a special place in my heart. It was sad to find out it closed. In its place is Lake Pavilion. I'll hold my judgement until I dine here.Well, I dined here. A few notes... Parking - Sucks. Don't bother parking at the lot. Look for parking on the street instead. Waiting for a table - Not bad. We were seated pretty much immediately. This was around 1pm. Service - Mediocre. The ladies with the dim sum cart doesn't always stop at the table letting you know what's available. Wait staff is eh. What is it about refilling tea pots at dim sum places? The waiters see the lid tilted sideways (clear indication that the tea pot is empty), but they always lift it up to make sure there really is no more tea. Why would we lie?? We're thirsty!Food - Speaking of tea pots... They're teeny tiny. Only large enough to fill 2-3 tea cups, also teeny tiny. As for the dim sum, variety is not the issue. There is a huge selection. My gripe is that the food is not hot. Every dish we got was lukewarm. Now, what really got to me were the bathrooms. The bathrooms are located right next to the entrance/exit to and from the parking lot. The men's bathroom door was WIDE open. Women, kids, family walking by can see men standing front of the urinals. I have no problem with a certain level of exhibitionist, but seeing men peeing? Ain't no one got time or tolerance for that!

The restaurant is still very spacious with a good amount of tables. Comfortable setting and seating combined.I must say the food served at night is very good, especially the 1st dish Lobster - extremely fresh - so it was the STAR of the night! The Peking Pork Chops were crispy but did not have enough sour taste to it and sauce covered up. The crispy tofu dish was on point. The veggies were made to perfection. In addition, we ordered the 5th dish, Peking Duck, and it was overly cooked as if they reheated it because the skin was very dark-colored and the meat was semi-dried. The waiter sliced up the duck for us, which was appreciated, but not sure if he cut off all the meat for us. Sadly to say, it was the WORST dish of the night! The husband was craving for a GOOD PEKING DUCK AND WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! In the beginning of dinner, they serve these good tasting sour radish!

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4962,"Came here at the request of my in-laws who wanted to try it out.  I was dubious since fellow Yelpers had really not given this place high marks for what is standard Cantonese fare.  We arrived at peak time, Saturday night at 7 pm and the restaurant was full but with no wait time for a table for 8.  I usually keep my reviews fairly short but on rare occasions, an experience warrants much more than that.  This Cantonese seafood restaurant sits in the shell of the old Palace Diner and the renovation work was well done, if not unoriginal.  First let's get to the good.  Place was clean for a Chinese seafood restaurant, servers were attentive and polite.  Plates changed regularly and without request.  And that's all the good.  Now the bad.Parking is a travesty here.  The lot in the back for customers can probably house enough cars for a third of the restaurant's volume.  To make matters worse, there is little available street parking since most meters are taken and the rest is taken by occupants of the residential homes in the adjoining streets.  No municipal or private lots available nearby but if you're willing to park on the side of the Long Island Expressway service road and walk a long block or two, parking might be easier to find.  To think that anyone would go to this much trouble to eat here however is doubtful and if you do, you need to question your sanity or how much you had to drink before coming here.The food.....what can I say?  First, let's be clear.  It wasn't the worst Cantonese fare I've had by a long stretch of the imagination.  So why the horrible review?  Simply because the owner's here are a bunch of money grubbing cheapskates.  Our one half of a crispy chicken had less chicken on the plate than a 3 piece meal at KFC.  Seriously.  And they  had the balls to charge $12.95 for it.  Oh, and it was dry and the skin soggy.  OK, that wasn't a winner, but hey I'm an optimist.  Ordered twin lobsters in ginger and scallion sauce, a Cantonese staple.  The lobsters were TINY and the pieces so scarce that they didn't even need to stack pieces on top of one another.  There was enough space on the plate for each to inhabit its own space.  It was also kind of bland, which was terribly disappointing when they charged $42.95 for it.  My go to spot for Cantonese in Flushing, Mellie's on Northern, charges around $30, has much more meat, and tastes great.  WTF is all I can say.  Now we move onto the sweet and sour pork ribs.  Sauce was decent.  Problem was that we ordered chicken and not pork ribs.  I'm fluent in Cantonese and the server was clear on our order since she double checked before putting it in.  Lots of bones and a heavy hand with the corn starch didn't help.  What ticked me off was that the server tried to convince me to let them plate it on a regular plate rather than in a hollowed out pineapple in an effort to skimp on the cost.  Seriously, if you're going to charge me $15.95 for sweet and sour turd, the least you can do is spend the money to make it pretty.  I told her I expected our meal in the pineapple as shown.  Oh and by the way, a small order from your local takeout joint was larger.  She also managed to miss my order of Peking pork chops but perhaps that was a blessing in disguise.Finally, the so-called Peking duck.  What a disgrace.  This duck must have been swimming in the ocean when they caught it because it was salty as s^&*(.....all the way down to the bones.  Also, they don't serve Peking duck.  They serve roast duck in a traditional Peking duck bun.  IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.  Those in the know, know that Peking duck has crispy skin, little to no fat due to the unique cooking process and should be lightly seasoned.   This was roast duck with soy sauce on a bun.  I'm insulted.  The duck was fatty, salty and the skin mushy.  WTF WTF WTF.  At least the bun was tasty with the hoisin sauce.  We also had fried rice but it wasn't anything special.  In summation, portions are REALLY SMALL here and they can't justify that with the prices they charge.  There are plenty of other similar and BETTER restaurants in Flushing which charge a reasonable price for much better and more food.  To give you an idea, the portions were all about a third smaller than other similar restaurants like East, Corner 28, Mellie's and Ocean Jewels but charge about 20-30% more.  Our tab for twin lobsters, half a chicken, fried rice, sweet and sour pork, half a duck, and snow pea shoots (which tasted the best by far) was $160 before tip.  This same meal probably runs about $120 in any other restaurant.  And we all left hungry since the portions were so much smaller.  Never going back, this place is a joke.  Don't say I didn't warn you.",1.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,32.4000015259,"optimist,request,Cantonese,in-laws,restaurant,seafood restaurant,renovation

They have free parking in the back.We got there on a Sunday when the restaurant just opened. Thank god we did because when we left their parking lot looked like chaos. Cars were packed in ever possible space and then blocking other cars because they made their own lanes. I wouldn't even attempt to park there on a weekend if I didn't get there early...and then you have to worry about getting out.Granted I don't speak Chinese but I was hoping one of the 3 waitress would understand water in English, poorly pronounced cantonese, and sign language/ charades. 4th attempt worked.Maybe we got there really early but I felt the same 5 carts were circling around.

My family and I came here for a pre Mother's Day dinner. Out of all the food we ordered, our favorites were the shell steak that came with waffle fries and the golden fried rice. The steak was really tender and flavorful. And the au jus was so good I poured it on everything. I don't normally like steak, but this was just so good!! Unfortunately, the waffle fries were cold and tasted stale. The fried rice was really fluffy, the golden raisins added sweetness against the salty shaved cured eggs. And sliced broccoli stems added great crunch. The service was unfortunately non existent. No one came to change our plates or portion the fried rice for the guest, like most Chinese restaurants do. I personally don't mind, but if I have to tip, I'd like some kind of service.

Lake Pavilion bills itself as an upscale Chinese restaurant and while you can get upscale food, the service leaves a lot to be desired. Many times our teapots were empty, we had to ask for clean plates, they forgot when we asked them to bring more bowls, etc. We ordered king crab made 3 ways ($38/lb!

They have valet parking in the back that is pretty chaotic, but they always find you a spot, for it's about $3. It's kinda one of the better places my family chooses to dimsum in. The decor is cheesier than other places - silly angel chandeliers included.  Coming in a large group will probably land you a table on the top part (where the bride and groom typically sit during Chinese wedding banquets), but that's not too bad. You really can't get food if you get a ""private"" room. It's really hard to fetch the cart ladies, even when they come the food is already gone - so be ready to chase them if you end up in a room with only you and your family/friends in it. The wait is seriously shorter if you know someone who works here so use your guanxi skills. lol That waiting area gets ridiculous tho. The dimsum food is ok. Not mediocre - even for a master dimsum hater such as myself. I kinda like their baked pork buns (char siu bao) - which come with the ""pineapple"" top. I haven't had a bad dumpling here - but don't be that guy who gets XLB during dimsum then complains about it not being the best, because there are places for that and you are just trying to fool yourself.

Dear Manager, was it really worth arguing with your customers over $30 tip when they're already spending $1700? Could you not pull your customer aside to discuss this instead of accusing him in front of all his guests that he underpaid? Lastly, please make sure your calculations are right before accusing others. As for the food, it would've gotten 3 stars. Dishes are hit or miss. Only thing I remembered being good was the abalone.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,3760,"Our company invited us here for a free dinner so why not. It's a easy place to get to, it's literally right off the Long Island Expressway. The food, service, and overall experience was alright.Food - Chicken, duck, shrimp w/ mayo sauce and walnuts, and more.Chicken - Pretty good. It wasn't salty and they did not over cook it.Peking duck - We had the peking duck served with the bun and I think scallions. Our colleague from Atlanta calls it ""chinese taco's"". It was pretty good but I wished it was served at a warmer temperature.Shrimp w/ mayo sauce - This is probably one of my favorite dishes in general. I love shrimp and I love mayo. What I didn't like about the one they made here, it was too yellow looking and the way the dish was presented looked unflattering. Usually at other restaurants, they serve it with the plate rimmed with brocoli or some places add shrimp chips just to give the dish some color and a nicer presentation. The shrimp didn't taste bad but I've had better.As for the rest, we ordered some vegetable that was cooked really well. We also ordered Chow Fun? I dunno what they call some of these dishes in english. But for the rest, they were all okay.Drinks - Tsingtao, Heineken, and Budweiser, tea, Coke, Sprite, House wine, and since it's Chinese New Year, they had a table right by the entrance with a display of priced wine, whiskey, and cognac bottles. I'm not even sure if they have a license for that. If I'm not mistaken, I think in New York, beer and wine license is under 1 license and liquor license is separate. Service - Excellent but towards the end, they were kinda pushing us to leave. The restaurant wasn't full or anything and since it was a company dinner, we wanted to sit and chit chat for a bit but the servers kept coming and asking us if we're done and trying to take away our plates while some of us were still eating.Verdict - Not a bad place at all despite the service towards the end of our evening. The food came out in good timing. I enjoyed the portions except for the shrimp w/ mayo sauce. There were barely any walnuts in that dish. Other than that, I really might just come back again some day with my family. They have their own parking lot in the back and meter parking right out front.

I asked for 2 har gow and 1 siu mai. They gave me the two har gow on top of each other, assuming it was the same thing. We finished the first har gow, lifted the bamboo steamer and realized that under there was another siu mai. So i told a waitress...she looked at me clueless, then brought over a manager, who was obviously doubting me. Seriously, would i waste time arguing about an effin dim sum?! So he canceled an order of siu mai and i said he should have canceled an order of hargow since i only got one of them. He then got frustrated and asked me which dim sum auntie served me...he eventually brought her over and she goes i remember! You ordered two har gow and 1 siu mai! I said I know, but i got two siu mai and 1 har gow! She goes no you didnt. (Yes, apparently I am now blind and do not know what is blantantly right in front of me?) So i said there was a siu mai under that hargow she gave me...and then she was like OHHHHHHHHHHHH. That's when the manager took back the siu mai, canceled the one har gow on the bill and realized they were wrong. And an apology? Yeah right, not today buddy....I was most unhappy about the fact that they rushed us out when we were leaving. We just got up to leave and put on our jackets, and the waiters immediately came over to clear our table, even if it meant they were bumping into us (we had 5 kids with us too) so that was very rude.

We spoke to the waiter that serviced our table and asked him why were the contents of the head missing and he said it was cooked within the dish. He avoided our table completely afterwards and another waiter serviced our table for the rest of our meal.  Be very careful with ordering expense dishes that isn't served as a whole.

If you wait till after 11am they will come out with any fried, stir fry, and you can order from their lunch menu. Their fried flat noodles that comes from those dim sum carts is a little spicy but it is amazing! Their dim sums are all legit and great!

YES I said it! The wait wasn't so bad but they seated us in front of all their utensils so it was inconvenient for the waiters to grab stuff. Besides that we order things that we never seen in other restaurants. Like their duck intestines stir fry with green peppers in black fermented sauce. This dish was amazing!

Although the language barrier is partially there, our love for food is our mutual language.Entering Lake Pavilion at 1:00pm on Sunday afternoon, I observed a massive, banquet sized dining room that was empty minus two tables which sat men and women dressed in white at one and men and women in black at the other.As the light went on in my head that food service for lunch was a thing of the past and the people (in black and white) eating were staffers, my neighbor talked to management and we were seated. As I do not know the native tongue nor able to read emotions, I think it was not a major problem. Unfortunately I can not tell you exactly what the four items we were served by name, as my neighbor never looked at the menu, rather he discussed with the waiter what was available and in ten minutes the food was served. One Roast Pork dish, succulent meat with a beautifully crusted outside portion. The fried tofu was sauced and served with a deep green leafy vegetable, similar to escarole. The fried fish, similar to flounder in texture flaky, light and very tasty followed by a chicken curry dish. Each dish was so very unique and authentic in comparison to the small store front Chinese food locations in my area and the surrounding areas.

The ambiance is very nice and the air conditioning is superb but the kitchen staff prepared and made the food too fast. We had two tables and the first dish came out as expected, our appetizer the regular jellyfish, beef, pork, cured meat with pickled vegetables), then our next dish was lobster.We thought that was odd but sure, why not? Lobster is usually dish #5 and it came out as #2. Then, our fish came out as dish #3 which was supposed to be dish #6 came out. Fish should never be eaten cold, it should always be eaten hot-warm. When we tooka bite, it was nearing warm-cold which meant the fish had been prepared and was likely sitting in the kitchen before being brought out. Then, then square fried tofu came out which was supposed to be dish #2. When all of us grabbed one, 10 minutes later the sauce came...too late. Sheesh, talk about timing. Our entrees were all out of sync and the dishes did not come out one by one, it came out 2 at once or even 3 at once. Least to say, we were not pleased by the out of sync orders. We're not paying chump change here, we're paying a good premium and expect premium service. Lake Pavillion manager, step up your game. Your parking lot is way too small, we parked in Guam -- at least get the food right. Just disappointed at how service went last night. Other than that, food was good but we've had better.

Nevertheless, it was still tasty.  -----About the service------I came here a bit past dinner time (around 9pm) and service was great.

And when there was a table free, they tell us they can't give us a table because they want to hold it for the wedding party because they weren't sure they were going to fit everyone in the main dining area and may have to seat some of them in the private dining area we were in. This was beyond frustrating since we were hungry and cranky already. I just gave them the birthday cake to put in the refrigerator. Anyways, we ordered banquet style and the food was okay. After everything was in order, I guess it was fine. And they took pictures for us so that was appreciated. The bill was pretty expensive though since we had a large table of people.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,35664,"I grew up going to Palace Diner - for an after school snack to breakfast to after-boozing-late-night drunk dining. Needless to say, Palace held a special place in my heart. It was sad to find out it closed. In its place is Lake Pavilion. I'll hold my judgement until I dine here.Well, I dined here. A few notes... Parking - Sucks. Don't bother parking at the lot. Look for parking on the street instead. Waiting for a table - Not bad. We were seated pretty much immediately. This was around 1pm. Service - Mediocre. The ladies with the dim sum cart doesn't always stop at the table letting you know what's available. Wait staff is eh. What is it about refilling tea pots at dim sum places? The waiters see the lid tilted sideways (clear indication that the tea pot is empty), but they always lift it up to make sure there really is no more tea. Why would we lie?? We're thirsty!Food - Speaking of tea pots... They're teeny tiny. Only large enough to fill 2-3 tea cups, also teeny tiny. As for the dim sum, variety is not the issue. There is a huge selection. My gripe is that the food is not hot. Every dish we got was lukewarm. Now, what really got to me were the bathrooms. The bathrooms are located right next to the entrance/exit to and from the parking lot. The men's bathroom door was WIDE open. Women, kids, family walking by can see men standing front of the urinals.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,4009,"Lake Pavilion is a throwback to the old banquet halls that have become a rare sight in any of the Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn.  Classic Cantonese cooking is being overtaken by Taiwan, Shanghai, Szechuan and other regional cuisines du jour.  It is remembered as the central style of Chinese cooking in the US for the last 50-70 years mainly because it was the largest immigrant group during that time.  I recognize the manager from the restaurant on Main St & Franklin years ago, but the name escapes me now.  This newer version just off the LIE is a facelift of the old place.Wedding, full-moon, anniversary and birthday banquet style meals are their specialty, especially with rare ingredients that I think the chef relishes in preparing.  The more offbeat, the better to show off the skills and originality.  In addition to the main dining room, several private party rooms are available for 10-30+ people.During a recent dinner, we saw some wild dishes coming out of the kitchen such as spiny lobster salad, seared wagyu beef served table side and winter melon soup still in the melon.  Several Peking (Beijing) ducks were wheeled out on service carts to be sliced and served as well.  Our food was way more pedestrian, but I want to try some of that exotic stuff next time.  The wait staff was a well-oiled machine with food flowing out of the kitchen at a fast clip, water & tea constantly refilled and dishes cleared at a serious pace.Dim sum during the weekends are another matter with a constant crowd from late morning to mid afternoon.  Dim sum dishes are solid, tasty and are also a little larger than those at nearby Good Fortune (formerly East Manor). For instance, the pan-fried pork dumplings are 4 per dish (3 at GF) and the shrimp sprimg rolls are 5 per dish (4 at GF).  Good Fortune might have the edge in variety, but I think Lake Pavilion has the edge in taste.  As others have said, the parking lot out back can't handle the traffic flow, so I always look for street parking and can usually find it.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,6.40000009537,"cooking,banquet halls,Lake Pavilion,throwback,sight,any,pedestrian,Chinatowns,Manhattan,Queens,Brooklyn,specialty,cuisines,meals,ingredients,Shanghai,Szechuan,Taiwan,Cantonese,version,Good Fortune,some,cooking,style,wagyu beef,immigrant group,restaurant,name,dishes,manager,food,dining room,kitchen,wait staff,party rooms,table side,melon,chef,Wedding,LIE,originality,addition,dinner,spiny lobster salad,dish,dish,winter melon soup,service carts,ducks,stuff,US,Chinese,Main St,Franklin,skills,instance,shrimp sprimg rolls,pork dumplings,Beijing,edge,edge,street parking,Fortune,variety,taste,parking lot,GF,matter,others,traffic flow,dishes,East Manor,dishes,sum,kitchen,food,machine,clip,water,tea,weekends,crowd","7,2,2,7,1,7,1,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,2,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,4,1","0.130523085594,0.109744682908,0.0570365041494,0.0544863119721,0.0499390214682,0.0440826937556,0.0300570037216,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0262561645359,0.0258979927748,0.0211093816906,0.0137298135087,0.0137298135087,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.0125302169472,0.009785188362,0.00940237380564,0.00929717998952,0.00919179897755,0.00919179897755,0.00880609173328,0.00856953859329,0.00801503937691,0.00801503937691,0.0077169216238,0.007062332239,0.00669086258858,0.00614296458662,0.00614296458662,0.00584708526731,0.00576611841097,0.00565461441875,0.00562192080542,0.00560730136931,0.0053982688114,0.0053982688114,0.00538581889123,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00537531496957,0.00524252653122,0.00524252653122,0.00491926679388,0.00491095380858,0.00491095380858,0.00490363221616,0.00476573593915,0.00476573593915,0.0047484007664,0.0047484007664,0.00402456102893,0.00365075119771,0.0034266023431,0.0034266023431,0.00290809292346,0.00288631906733,0.00288631906733,0.00288360891864,0.00277861906216,0.00252526043914,0.00252526043914,0.00252288929187,0.00247053010389,0.0024391207844,0.00233809789643,0.00219447934069,0.00216409633867,0.00216382928193,0.0021614828147,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00183471350465,0.00171019916888,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318,0.00160512712318"

But it was only until last night that I treated myself to their banquet style dinner. I was pleasantly delighted.I entered the large hall and sniffed the air. It was clean and cool, not like the normal rancid air of other Flushing Chinese restaurants. Neatly manicured rows of plants decorated the edges. I was impressed by the hygiene of the restaurant -- white tablecloths on every table and the wait staff was dressed in matching purple and white outfits.Then we ordered and the food came. In each dish that arrived, I could taste the ""wok hay"" -- a term meaning spirit of the wok that breathes out of the food. Sautéed sea whelks in fish sauce were juicy and steaming (albeit small). Lamb chops were tender and not gamy and served atop a mountain of onions. Steak with fried bean curd was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and served with an addictive sauce, and the side of bean curd it was served with had crispy edges. I also enjoyed their cold crab served with vinegar sauce, (a specialty from Chao Zhou), a beast I estimated at around three pounds, when most other competitors serve theirs at a meager 1.5-2 lbs. Even the vegetables were fantastic; at one point I found myself shoveling forkfuls of sugar pea shoots topped with dried scallop threads into my mouth.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,158230,"I am surprise at some of the bad comments about this restaurant. So far, I really like this place. Since its grand opening, I've been here several times with friends and families. Regarding food selection, this restaurant has the most extensive Chinese menu that i had ever seen. There are many unique dishes on the menu that i had just never heard of before and looks like seafood is its specialty. Let's talk about dim sum first. They have all the standard stuff such as Shao Mai, egg custard,which are all very yummy.  But they also have unique dishes that I never had in other places nor know the the names in English; :) So far, one of my favorites has been the jelly cakes, :) but most other things were really yummy too. I also like their tea, which seems to be better quality than other restaurants. This is now the must go dim sum place for our families. For dinner, I've been here three times. The most recent one was for mother's day. Knowing that the restaurant scene on mother's day is always so crazy, my sister in-law made the reservation weeks in advance. Our reservation was at 6m Sunday evening and we were seated at 6pm sharp. we had selected a pre-fixe dinner menu with various type of dishes including walnut shrimps, fried flounder, steak etc. The food was served righ away. I must say that I was so nicely surprise how tender and juicy the steak was, which I didn't expect form a Chinese restaurant. And everything else was just tasty. My entire family had enjoyed the dinner very  much and we all had a great time.  One very unique thing about this place is the setting and layout. I love the VIP rooms and that's where we had the mother's day dinner. Its just a perfect place for friends and families gathering and it made the entire dining experience just extremely pleasant. I see most people complained about services. I don't know if we've been lucky or we focus more on the food. :) Of all these times we dined here, we haven't had any bad experience with services. Again, we just keep coming back for the food.

It appears to be very packed but when you go get your number at most you will wait is probably 10 mins. Other place in main st you will prob wait 30-40 mins. In terms of the actual dim sum it's just as good as the normal places in flushing but no need to go all way down to Main Street and stress yourself out finding a parking spot.

New Lake Pavilion,5372,6015 Main St,Flushing,11355.0,144509,"The food is great here but the 3 star rating mostly accounts for the cluster f#ck that is Lake Pavilion on any given weekend day/evening/Chinese holiday. The valet parking out back is helpful if you don't mind waiting in a line of cars that wrap around the block just to get in. Flushing seems to attract the most horrible drivers, so beware. Once you get in, waiting for a table after spending 30 minutes parking will be your next fun task. The front area gets so crowded that it is literally a sea of bodies pressed together as steaming hot plates of food pass by (dangerously close to your head). Crowd control doesn't seem to be a priority for the management, they kind of just ignore it. Remember to bring your breath mints, as you will be breathing about 4 inches away from a stranger's face. When you finally do get a table, don't expect too much in terms of good service from the overworked wait staff. That being said, their dim sum is arguably the best in the Flushing. I've been frequenting dim sum joints in the area since I was a little kid, and this place is delicious. I've also had many traditional Chinese banquets here with family and their dishes are really great. Not too salty or greasy. Wouldn't recommend the Peking duck though.

I was here for dim sum twice(giving it a second chance) and something is wrong with their meats. Shrimps in shrimp dumplings and pork in soup pork buns taste like it's been in the fridge for weeks...I was here for a wedding to try their actual food and it's as worst as it gets. Food is too salty and once again tasting stale...2) Service is horrible. The dim sum cart ladies aggressively hands you the dim sums even when you say NO. I mean I don't want it! Stop shoving it in my face! I asked the waiters 2 times to refill my tea and they never came back.3) This place is super crowded when it first opened up because it's new and tons of people want to try it out, but the hype is now over so it's not as crowded as it use to be.4) My friend had his wedding here and the area they rented out to him doesn't even have a dance floor. Everyone was just dancing around next to their tables...5) They have valet parking out back. Probably have 30-40 spots.6) Very Pricey!

They took our jackets and made us feel right at home. I love the hands on approach and being able to watch the chef prepare our plates. The menu is small yet very appealing. The meal started with a complimentary tapas - very nice! We ordered the octopus, razor clams and gambas (shrimps). All the seafood was tasty and had the right amount of heat. Portions are large and quite generous. To finish, we ordered the cheese plate which was one of the best, I've ever had. The blue cheese was incredible. I loved all of the preparations. We were quite full so we skipped dessert. I savored my glass of cava which was nicely dry while my husband had the kalimocho (red wine and coca cola) and the sherry cocktail. Both of the drinks were excellent. I can see us coming every few weeks to try new tapas,  have a conversation and enjoying each other's company.

They have happy hour everyday until 6:30PM for both drinks and food, which was definitely a nice surprise. I got the red wine sangria and my sister the cava sangria, both priced at $7! To eat we ordered the Spanish tortilla, rosemary manchengo cheese, and Jamon from the hh menu. In addition we ordered the shrimp in garlic oil from the regular menu as we'd read good things on Yelp. The Tortilla is like a Spanish omelette with potatoes and caramelized onions which was pretty good and filling. The manchengo cheese was quite pretty as it looks like it was torched a bit on the outside with rosemary but it isn't that flavorful. However, it's a good option to order from the hh food menu to pair with the jamon. Not sure if I would order it otherwise. Our favorite was the shrimp which consisted of juicy shrimp pieces with flavorful garlic chili oil to dip the bread in!Overall a very cute place to come for dinner on a Sunday night.

My friends and I were happy to enjoy a late-night dinner (AKA in our circle as ""Spanish dinner"") at Lamano. A highlight of the night was the Coca- a Catalan flatbread that featured diverse, rich flavors: vidalia onion, piquillo peppers, manchego cheese, and of course, an anchovy. We also ordered La Mano Olives (olives with raisins, pine nuts, lemon, and clover honey), which were addictive. Lovers of galicky shrimp, I'd recommend the Gambas Al Ajillo to you. The Patatas Bravas was solid (nothing out of the ordinary), but it would've been great to try the Croquetas (the kitchen was out- something to hopefully try another time). For dessert, the crème brûlée is a must-try. A plus: it doesn't have that panna cotta texture (if I wanted that texture, I'd get panna cotta!) and comes in a pretty big size. It's perfect for 2 or 3 people to split. The wine selection was good, and the service was friendly.

The place is still relatively new and hidden, so we were able to be seated right away.This place is tapas-style so we just decided to split a bunch of dishes:Sobrassada (4 stars): This was pretty good and it was easy to share as it was served on three pieces of bread.Pulpo murcia (4.5 stars): This may actually be some of the best octopus I've ever had in terms of how tender it was. Potatoes were nothing exciting, but the octopus more than made up for it.Pan con tomate y queso (3 stars): I felt like this dish had potential, but ended up being pretty bland.Tortilla (4 stars): This was another one of my favorite dishes of the night, though I felt that the aioli was a tad too strong for the rest of the dish.Patatas a la riojana (4 stars): This dish was also pretty good, had a nice spice to it overall.Meat and cheese board (3.5 stars): We ordered the largest meat and cheese board that had some good options on it, but nothing that really blew me away.Peach dessert (2 stars): I don't know what this dish was supposed to be, but it was served to us as warm peaches with some sort of vanilla whipped cream and pistachios. The peaches were hardly soft and not really sweet at all, and the whipped cream did not add much either. Maybe this was a fluke, but I would not bother with this dessert.Overall, there were some good flavors in some of the dishes, but I really was underwhelmed by the food. The portions were all pretty small, as it is tapas, and sort of all blended together at some point. Also, a lot of the dishes were served with the same bread, so it got to be a bit uninteresting after a while. Nevertheless, the service was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly--though I wish they had staggered our dishes a bit instead of sending them all out at once.

Lamano,5374,265 W 20th St,New York,10011.0,61222,"Lamano is a Spanish tapas spot and when it comes to Spanish tapas, I kind of have a weakness for them and here they do it well. Came here with a friend to try it out and at first glance from entering is its cozy yet cool vibe. We ordered a sangria and a kalimocho which are wine-based drinks. The kalimocho was nice with the effervescence of the blackberry liqueur.  As for the tapas, we took three to share: the gambas al ajillo (shrimp with garlic sauce), the croquetas (croquettes with ham), and chorizo (Spanish sausage). Out of those three, the standout was the chorizo which had a spicy pepper slaw and toast. The sausage had a seasoned heat to it with the spices and paired with the toast and peppers, it was a great bite of food. The gambas were good but I wanted the shrimp to have more salt to it while the croquettes were tasty especially with the aioli, the filling was lacking a bit of salt. The seating is communal so if you're not a fan of that, well you're out of luck.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,23619,"Yesterday, I was in the mood for Chinatown Flushing food. I did not know exactly what I wanted, but I wanted something tasty. After, some discussion and debate the wife decided on Lamb Noodle Soup.The journey to this location is in itself its own review. Lamb Noodle Soup is not a storefront restaurant, it is a food stall within the Golden Shopping Mall, address 41-28 Main Street. We discovered this after we arrived and noticed 12 plus businesses with the same address on the main part of building. As we walked in it was a maze of food stalls. I must say that I am not a fan of food stalls, but I was up for an adventure. After wandering around for 10 or so minutes and looking like ""undercover 50"", bingo, we found the place. Tip: go to 41 St. Rd; see computer store canopy; walk in; walk up 8 steps and turn right: Lamb Noodle Soup. It is located on the second level. I think you can only get to this level from the outside, but don't quote me.Walking in you will find a simple and no nonsense food stall. Communal tables, counters with seats, a refrigerator with soda and the counter where you order food. There is a big sign with the menu on the left, now it is in Chinese. No help to this Latin boy and my suburban wife, but the ladies were very, very nice in helping us out.I knew we were getting soup, but did not know what to expect. We both ordered Beef Noodle Soup and we received two huge bowls of broth with beef slices, handmade stretched noodles, cellophane noodles with cilantro on top. Very tasty and delicious. The broth was a beef broth and very standard in taste, but the jewel of the meal was the handmade noodles. There is something to be said about fresh noodles. It is the texture that sets it apart from package noodles.

The noodles have that signature hand pulled texture which just rolls on your tongue and melts in your mouth. They have dark vinegar and chili oil available on the side, which add a new dimension.

I like mine with a heaping spoon of chili oil, few dabs of the black vinegar. This concoction is as good as it gets. The lamb broth is very savory without a strong lamb stench. The fresh hand pulled noodles are very flavorful   and are cooked perfectly. It has a very welcoming texture. They have a bunch of appetizers ranging from large spicy green peppers to lamb steaks. These can keep you busy while you wait for your food, which comes out almost as fast as McD's. Other than that they also have beef noodles if you dont like lamb.

Some days they will sell the bones that have been used for cooking the soup.  You'll probably see the bones stacked up in the back, and can just point to inquire.  There are 2 different kinds of bones.  My limited Chinese hit epic fail here and I couldn't figure out which ones to order.  Also, they put the bones in some additional cooking/flavoring process (maybe to heat it back up?) and you end up waiting awhile for them to be served.  Be warned, there are no English signage *at all*, and most of the staff do not speak (much) English.  Also, as Ryan mentioned, you clean up your own dishes (leftover liquids into bucket, solid wastes e.g. chopstick wrapper into the trash bin, then the plastic noodle bowls go in a stack above the trash bin).  You also pick up your own food from the counter.  They call it out when it's ready, and you walk the food to your own table.",5.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",2,0,0.0,8.0,"lamb noodle,spot,Golden Mall,bones,way,back,Xian Famous Foods,hair salon,level,place,bones,dish,flavors,dishes,way,textures,explosion,bones,side,lamb noodle,bones,beef,beef,back,cilantro,flavoring agents,meat,salad,soup,epic fail,ones,cooking/flavoring process,kinds,dishes,trash bin,chopstick wrapper,wastes,bucket,leftover liquids,food,food,English,noodle bowls,Chinese,trash bin,stack,counter,table,Ryan,staff,most,signage","7,7,2,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7","0.101874150336,0.0876826271415,0.0523220896721,0.0516055636108,0.0480449385941,0.0480449385941,0.0442352481186,0.0420884527266,0.0420884527266,0.0420884527266,0.02703506127,0.0245923064649,0.0201680231839,0.0200948808342,0.0182831473649,0.0160608142614,0.0160025116056,0.0144653217867,0.0138853089884,0.0135421995074,0.0132220452651,0.0123195415363,0.0122911548242,0.0122282598168,0.0107560753822,0.0107560753822,0.0107351094484,0.0107351094484,0.0107169803232,0.00976874120533,0.00976874120533,0.00975798629224,0.00918057281524,0.00914407055825,0.0083177248016,0.00727805308998,0.00727805308998,0.00727805308998,0.00727805308998,0.00681014591828,0.00680457986891,0.00676341354847,0.00625158799812,0.00578589458019,0.00576039496809,0.0050399992615,0.00503559410572,0.00503147719428,0.00430966960266,0.00319623551331,0.00319623551331,0.00299988710321"
Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,168,"True Flushing experts may pooh-pooh the scene as getting woefully gentrified as it gets more exposure from food shows and self-proclaimed foodies. As a relatively new New Yorker and someone who is completely unfamiliar with the area (and doesn't speak Chinese), though, the area's underground malls and unmarked, extremely low-key food stands still spark wonder in my mind and tummy. This Lamb Noodle Soup spot is a perfect example of the adventure of eating here (for me). We were on a search to find this knowing only that it existed in one of the food malls in the area, and knowing what the sign looked like based on photos on the Yelp page. It was not an easy task! We had to ask several people - most of whom had no interest in helping us, and wind through endless narrow hallways and crowded spaces to finally find the small restaurant, tucked in a corner I believe hear a hair stylist. The first thing I noticed was that there were literally piles of raw meat piled outside the place. Those who are more gemaphobic might have seen this and immediately turned around to leave, but I figured I'd take my chances and at least we knew the meat was fresh, right?The ladies behind the counter spoke zero english but we could get across to them that we wanted the lamb noodle soup. How can you go to a place called Lamb Noodle Soup (at least in English) and not order the namesake dish? Plus it was cold outside and just perfect for a nice big hot bowl of soup. It comes in two sizes and as soon as I had my first taste I immediately wished I had gotten the larger one. The broth was perfectly flavorful, the lamb so wonderfully tender, and there were lots of noodles to dig into. I'm not a fan of gamey lamb but this was perfect - must be their special outdoor defrosting method that does it!

The meat is tender, flavorful, and abundant; the different types of noodles and wood ear provide so much texture; and the cilantro and broth round out the rest of the flavors and nutrients.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,132664,"I come to Flushing at least once a month for a haircut and I often stop by this stall for the large lamb noodle soup ($7).  I found out about this place after watching a video by a Youtube entertainer named Simply Dumpling.  I'm glad I watched the video.  This place is a small hole in the wall in a grimy-looking food court but I feel the bowl of noodles here is one of the best, if not the best bowl of noodles in Flushing.  The people who run this place don't really speak English, but all you have to tell them is 'large lamb noodle soup', pay $7, and then wait for it to come out.  There isn't a lot of sitting room here at all and the seats are pretty uncomfortable.  You'll feel cramped but the food more than makes up for it.  So the dish is a bunch of hand-pulled noodles in a hot, milky broth with additional glass noodles, wood-ear mushrooms, cilantro, and pieces of lamb.  The broth is so delicious.  It has a pretty neutral taste and I could sip on it forever.  The hand pulled noodles are definitely the star piece; they're nice and firm, chewy, and don't fall apart on you.  The pieces of lamb are usually solid, but they were definitely overcooked when I got this the other day.  I recommend putting a little bit (but not too much) of the chili oil they have here.  It's so good and makes the broth spicy.  The best part about this bowl of noodles is that it makes you want to keep eating it until you die.  It's a lot of food but I always finish it and enjoy it thoroughly.  At only $7 for the meal, it is definitely cheap and warrants a solid 5 star rating.",5.0 star rating,"Long Island, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,10.3000001907,"place,bowl,lamb noodle soup,haircut,stall,video,bunch,lot,place,broth,Flushing,English,entertainer,people,noodles,Youtube,part,video,best,noodles,noodles,glass noodles,food court,wall,lamb noodle soup,lot,bowl,food,lamb,noodles,pieces,noodles,sitting room,seats,cilantro,mushrooms,taste,Simply Dumpling,hand,broth,bowl,bit,chili oil,place,food,piece,star rating,meal,lamb,pieces,star","7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,3,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,6,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,5,1","0.074260532856,0.074260532856,0.073106713593,0.0641145184636,0.0641145184636,0.0428895242512,0.0398986451328,0.0390745289624,0.0385410115123,0.0370136536658,0.0363549590111,0.0321278907359,0.0307291578501,0.0245968997478,0.0191342215985,0.0182464458048,0.0165224950761,0.0163866057992,0.0146607933566,0.0129336407408,0.0128207830712,0.0117346290499,0.0116735100746,0.0116735100746,0.0111424243078,0.01097700838,0.00990589149296,0.00983598828316,0.00967160332948,0.00916736666113,0.00898687075824,0.00870203599334,0.00784497987479,0.00736369239166,0.00715342350304,0.00715342350304,0.00713323708624,0.00697767408565,0.0069062714465,0.00666890433058,0.00666307937354,0.00531264953315,0.00531264953315,0.00498507451266,0.00461055058986,0.00445967679843,0.00366621278226,0.00366621278226,0.00315570738167,0.00303807388991,0.00266958260909"

Past the stores selling clothing and questionable electronics, and.... you're there! The light at the end of the tunnel comes in the form of a bright orange ""Lamb Noodle Soup"" greets you at the end.Walking in, it's clear that the noodle soup is the thing to order. Heads up that the woman at the counter speaks mandarin, and if you're Cantonese is like mine, pathetic at best, you're best off sticking to English! Order it for here (for optimal MSG and chili oil access), pay (cash only, of course), have a seat, and listen for your order to be called out in the next 5 or so mins. Admire the people pulling and stretching the noodles behind the counter, and do NOT get distracted by the other food that your fellow patrons are eating.Once your food arrives, dig into the steaming bowls of noodles (two types!). Add some hot chili oil - careful.. - and some MSG (that's not salt!) if you want the full experience. It's a delicious balance of thin glassy noodles and thick white ones, fatty lamb and fresh cilantro, and hot chili with rich broth.

When we order to go, they pack the soup & and the noodles separately, which is a great so the noodles do not get soggy, but I'm more sure whether you'd have to ask for it or if they already do that anyway. But if you are brave enough to come in here, its located on the second floor, which you can get to, by walking straight inside the ground floor on main st, or walking in from the side-entrance which would take you directly up some stairs. This stall is located right across a barbershop, if i remember correctly. Be prepared to rub sweaty elbows with whomever you're sitting next to!PS: My mama told me that they've opened a second stall at New World Mall food court, which is a much much better environment than at Golden Mall. So if you want to taste this delicious lamb noodle soup, but do not want to venture into Golden Mall - who could blame ya?!, just head your little bum down a coupla blocks on main and head into New World Mall's food court. Just walk straight once you get off the escalator going down.. and you'll see it at the corner.Happy eating!",5.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,5.80000019073,"lamb noodles soup,mom,flakes,treat,soup,table,side-entrance,floor,noodles,home,condiment container,cooking,noodles,home,food court,ground floor,stall,New World Mall,stairs,barbershop,Mall,lamb noodle soup,environment,stall,escalator,Golden Mall,food court,bum,coupla,head,eating,elbows,mama","7,1,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,2,2,7,2,2,7,7,2,6,2,3,7,1,7,7,7,1","0.299641162157,0.121856488287,0.112928517163,0.0451414622366,0.0450909174979,0.0449119843543,0.0367750972509,0.0310395378619,0.0228309910744,0.019854394719,0.0172217153013,0.0171591881663,0.0156264081597,0.0132469134405,0.0122957490385,0.0120618222281,0.0120383109897,0.0115934545174,0.0105549264699,0.0105343461037,0.00985971745104,0.00985940266401,0.00974717736244,0.00811620987952,0.00764075852931,0.00753730908036,0.00621085893363,0.00543409725651,0.00543409725651,0.00543409725651,0.00542684551328,0.00344802043401,0.00344802043401"
Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,2125,"I like to stick things in little books and make cute presentations. So when I came here, naturally, I ordered some lamb-n-ate-it. (Get it? Laminate it? Laminated? Awesome).What to get: Lamb Noodle Soup, duh... with extra hot chili oil.What else: Don't look at the Ark, Marian. Keep your eyes shut.And what: I'm gonna blow up the Ark, Renée.Lamb Noodle Soup exists for me in that grey area between 4 and 5 stars. I waited outside for a good 20 minutes in my car and still my food tour partner did not emerge with the order. So I left the car parked illegally right in front of the Golden Mall and went inside to see what the hold up was about.It was so busy inside, which is why the orders were taking so long to come out. The people behind the counter weren't friendly at all, but that's okay. They don't provide any of the famous hot chili oil to go (at least they wouldn't, for me), so I opened up the food, sat at the table, and tried some of it (scalding hot) without the oil. Very bland... I would have never given it more than a 4 based on that.Then I added a crapload of hot chili oil (which is my jam, really). It totally took the dish to another level. It brought out all the flavour and made my head explode. Not in a sexual way. But that too, I guess.When I had the leftovers later, I was wishing for more hot chili oil. It floats on the surface when you add it, so sometimes it's nice to add more, as you go. The portion was absolutely huge. The noodles were great. The veggies were crunchy and enjoyable. The broth was very lightly flavoured, and a little bland without the oil. The meat wasn't so great... very grizzly, but I think that's the way it's supposed to be. And of course the oil: was the star of the show. Homemade I hope!?So I'll give this very popular place a tentative five stars for the excellent star dish when oil is added. It's far from my fave Chinese meal in Flushing though. I can think of three or four places which are off-the-charts good, and none moreso than the Lamb Cumin Noodle at Xi'an just downstairs in the basement - one of the best meals I've ever had anywhere.According to Garland, Richard Matt and David Sweat made noodle soup while on the lamb. Maybe it's the same recipe.Still, give Lamb Noodle Soup a try. It's authentic and filling and well-made and yum with great noodles. If you're anything like me, though, you'll want to add a ton of hot oil.Everything's better with oil, though, don't you think? Would you like me to show you what I mean by that? Later. I have friends cumin over in a few mins. I know, it's a bit lamb to make you wait. But you noodle this about me going into this relationship, so... oh, my friends are here. Hey bro!

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,30045,"For Directions please refer to Aryan's review, I would have never found it if i didn't read his review.     On a very Random Sunday, my eating partner and I ventured to Flushing. This is a rare occasion since we both live practically near the Chinatowns in the other boroughs. There really isn't much need to venture to Flushing for us. On this day we hit two noodle shops Sifu Chio and Lamb Noodle Soup. I wanted to try this place since watching the outer borough episode for Anthony Bourdain.      Walking into the Golden Shopping Mall I was fascinated with all the little eats they had in there. The First shop in boasted Huge steam buns ready for the oven. What a gorgeous sight. Lamb Noodle Soup was located almost to the back, walk up 4 steps ""beauty salon"" located on your left. There's a bathroom on the right next to the noodle place. There is nothing classy about this place with the smell from the tiny public bathroom and the full view of a hair salon right across but i was still dying to try it. Since i had previously eaten I ordered the small ($4.50) and my friend ordered the large ($5.50). It smelled really good.       The noodles are pulled and made with each order right then and there. The bowl came with small chunks of lamb and cilantro sprinkled all over the bowl. I love cilantro, Took a sip of the soup... how to describe it? Straight up MSG flavor and has a oily feel. Luckily i can't eat scorching hot noodle soup so i let everything permeate and cool off in the soup before continuing. The lamb itself tasted like beef but you know it's lamb when your face is inches away from the bowl and you smell that game smell of the lamb; but you can't taste it on the meat. It also made me sad that with all the cilantro in my bowl I would have loved the flavor of the soup to have an overpowered taste of cilantro but it didn't. Best part of this bowl was the noodle, it had a chewy consistency like still semi raw. I love it!     This place is not recommend for germaphobes because the ladies there handle food glove-less and handle money as each customer paid, I did not see them once wash their hands; this is not the cleanest place to eat. I like dirty cheap food. My biggest issue is that they speak mandarin and one woman speaks very bad English. I on the other hand speak very bad Cantonese and my English is just as bad; ordering here requires a lot of hand gesturing.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.0,14.8000001907,"Aryan,occasion,lamb,review,review,Directions,noodle,bowl,eating partner,boroughs,sip,Random,place,Flushing,place,Chinatowns,ladies,Lamb Noodle Soup,noodle shops,shop,borough episode,bowl,noodles,eats,noodle place,place,lamb,soup,noodle soup,soup,bathroom,bowl,cilantro,cilantro,everything,beauty salon,hair salon,bathroom,smell,order,flavor,steam buns,oven,sight,left,steps,back,right,view,friend,cilantro,chunks,feel,Sifu Chio,Anthony Bourdain,Golden Shopping Mall,place,taste,semi raw,consistency,germaphobes,hands,money,food glove-less,hand,hand,issue,food,MSG,mandarin,woman,customer,lamb,soup,English,bowl,cilantro,face,flavor,game smell,meat,beef,Cantonese,lot","1,4,7,5,5,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,2,2,5,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,3,1,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.126313060522,0.119217395782,0.0684297084808,0.0647707805037,0.0479755625129,0.0420334562659,0.0341295301914,0.023186950013,0.0229294300079,0.0228124503046,0.0212907586247,0.0200732834637,0.0180225167423,0.0178444180638,0.0127179455012,0.0118422023952,0.0114751774818,0.0107767516747,0.00953332614154,0.00947677716613,0.00927101355046,0.00802325829864,0.00797709077597,0.00755609059706,0.00728470599279,0.00727668264881,0.00698059611022,0.00697523774579,0.00696541788056,0.00696541788056,0.00674973847345,0.00663505354896,0.00648539373651,0.00624833954498,0.00609236350283,0.00580481765792,0.00579142384231,0.00579142384231,0.00579142384231,0.00577507307753,0.00527270557359,0.00509334122762,0.00509334122762,0.00508574442938,0.0050789588131,0.0050789588131,0.0050789588131,0.00507282791659,0.00506723765284,0.00506210001186,0.00465261097997,0.00462019722909,0.00461330544204,0.00449387123808,0.00448349863291,0.00447474746034,0.00423644157127,0.00343990325928,0.00343787507154,0.00343787507154,0.00343408482149,0.00298787723295,0.00298705045134,0.00298705045134,0.00298341852613,0.00298341852613,0.00290930084884,0.00278588291258,0.00273117539473,0.00237506837584,0.00237506837584,0.00234752125107,0.0022816057317,0.00228019431233,0.00222009117715,0.00216719415039,0.0020407459233,0.00184912153054,0.0017912578769,0.00172544876114,0.0015094934497,0.0015094934497,0.00140508869663,0.00116681098007"

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,86254,"Omg, why have I not tried you sooner my love??? Okay so There's a story for the lamb noodle stop, there is another location also in the new world Mal food court and the owner is the same. (The lady owner I'm friends with and she's super nice, but she's usually at the new world mall one) I tried the lamb noodle soup from that location and for some reason the soup was just not really lamb-y and the noodles were super soggy even tho it was served fresh and eaten right away. It was a but disappointing to be honest, but everyone just raves about this noodle place and I thought I had to give it another try in the golden mall location.Ordered take out and didn't eat it until like 2 hrs later, which must've downed the taste a little gut it still tasted amazing. The noodles were hand pulled, or  think knife cut, and there are also glass noodles in there along with shredded tofu skin.THE BROTH: holy mother sheep the broth is so tasty and fragrant that when I tasted it it made me cry  It wasn't MEHHHHH at all (get it? HAHA lamb... meh..? Sound..?... ok nvm)Only complaint is the soup is a bit too salty, but other than that great soup base and I don't date MSG even tho there probably is A LITTLE HELPFUL TIP: since the only language spoken there is Chinese, and there are no pictures. You can say ""yang-row me-an"" and the ladies will understand you.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,68999,"Just as good as everyone else says it is. Me and my friend come to the mall here to try out all the stalls inside. We couldn't find this place the first time because this place is actually up the stairs by the last door of the building and not by the other food stalls. We came back another time, walked in and looked around to see if they had a menu in English but no luck. One of the women was actually hand pulling dough that would become the noodles in the soup. Authentic. There was a language barrier but with a bit of pointing and finger signs and the word ""mian"" (noodle for chinese), we were able to order the lamb noodle soup for two. It took a few minutes and we sat down in whatever space we could find in the small store. There is a very cafeteria-like feel, like the other restaurants in the mall. Nowhere near modern, somewhat urban? Might need to wipe the part of the table you'll be using. We got our orders served in white plastic bowls. The soup. UGH. Too good. It seems to be a lamb bone broth (something close to the korean ox-tail soup). So clean and well seasoned, it went right down. The noodle was just right, chewy and not too lengthy. Everything just went really well together. The cilantro and mushroom and glass noodle. The lamb meat was alright, had a bit too much meat flavor in it for my liking but def was cooked just right. It isn't too bad to try it with the vinegar or the hot oil sauce they have on the tables but its very overpowering and you won't taste the original taste of the soup. and you know, original is always best.

I suggest tasting the broth first before adding anything else in. Then if you feel the need to add the chili oil, go for it. The chili oil are in random plastic containers and is shared between all the tables. Not the most sanitary thing, but you come here for the food. The broth without the chili oil was wonderful. So light but still full of flavor. With the chili oil, it added a very nice kick and still didn't over power the original flavor. There are different types of noodles in the bowl but I know for sure they hand make the flat white noodles in house. The noodles were great! And the lamb pieces were really tender and did not taste game-y at all. Overall a wonderful hearty bowl of goodness. I will definitely come back!

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,34318,"As the weekend winds down and I'm finally getting over my cold I get a craving for something soupy and comforting so I decided to give Lamb Noodle Soup a try since it's been on my to-do list for some time now.   The place is a hole in the wall and is one of many stalls in the Golden Mall.  Some people may remember that the building was once a struggling retail mall back in the day before it was converted into what it is today - a collection of food stalls.  It took me a minute to figure out which one it was since there are two levels to the mall and different entrances but it's the one that's located at street level all the way in the back with the orange sign.I've eaten at these Mainland China food malls before and have been to my fair share of dives but tonight, tonight was a different experience...  I walked down the hall and many of the stalls were gated up, not sure if they were closed for the night or just unoccupied but upon reaching the end I see a man passed out on the floor adjacent to the door I was looking for.  At this point I'm pretty hungry and determined to try these noodles so I look over, see the B grade displayed on the window, and decide to go for it.  I step inside and sitting by door was a guy with his feet up, without shoes OR socks on, talking loudly and smoking cigarettes.  Judging by what he was eating, my guess was that he was either an employee or maybe even the boss.  I ordered the large lamb noodle soup and it was ready in minutes.  The people behind the counter were friendly and although they did not speak English all you really needed to know was ""small"" or ""large"" to order.  The hand pulled noodles were fresh and of the flat and wide variety with good texture.  The chunks of lamb were tender and didn't taste gamey at all.  Also included in the bowl were clear noodles mixed in on the bottom.  While some Yelpers found the broth to be on the bland side I found it to be sufficiently flavorful (yes, there was MSG), though I did add the vinegar and hot pepper oil to enhance the flavor after my initial tasting.More than halfway though my food I noticed the lady behind the counter blowing her nose.  I pretended not to see anything and continued eating.  Good thing she had gloves on and was blowing into a napkin, but too bad she didn't change them and continued to handle the food.  Pretty much anything goes here...As I'm leaving I noticed that the drunken guy was no longer on the floor but instead I see another guy in front of the stall in the hallway butchering raw lamb meat from a box on the floor.  He paused for a moment and spat, not on the meat but into a box next the meat just inches away.  Yup, that did it for me, no mas.  Were the noodles tasty?  Sure.  Was it cheap?  At $5.50, yes definitely.  Am I going back?  Probably not.  There are other places in Queens where you can get hand pulled noodles that are just as good, if not better.  I knew going in that it was going to be cheap and dirty food, and usually I don't mind as long as it's tasty but this level of griminess, it got to me today...",3.0 star rating,"FLUSHING, NY",4,0,-0.10000000149,10.8999996185,"mas,Lamb Noodle Soup,building,place,one,craving,cold,list,something,employee,try,retail mall,stalls,one,people,wall,guy,Golden Mall,many,noodles,guy,food stalls,mall,food malls,street level,collection,levels,noodles,dives,share,sign.,back,way,entrances,noodles,Queens,Yelpers,stalls,floor,people,lamb,guess,hall,door,door,lamb noodle soup,counter,experience,man,B grade,end,window,feet,socks,shoes,smoking cigarettes,boss,stall,order,variety,texture,bowl,bottom,broth,side,Mainland China,guy,floor,lamb meat,floor,meat,meat,food,box,hallway,box,hand,lady,level,front,spat,noodles,English,anything,places,griminess,noodles,food,chunks,food,anything,counter,nose,flavor,pepper oil,vinegar,eating,napkin,gloves,thing,MSG","7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,1,1,7,1,2,1,6,1,2,2,2,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,2,2,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,1,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,3","0.52118229866,0.0544256530702,0.0420914776623,0.0420256182551,0.0378719419241,0.0196440983564,0.015281596221,0.015281596221,0.015281596221,0.0130057502538,0.0108777200803,0.0104377176613,0.00985009968281,0.00903755892068,0.00828754156828,0.00729166343808,0.00631131744012,0.00584278488532,0.00541298696771,0.00486201839522,0.00478524761274,0.0037496346049,0.00373600260355,0.00373600260355,0.00347139872611,0.00343927764334,0.00325841549784,0.00283304485492,0.00276296911761,0.00276296911761,0.00276296911761,0.00276296911761,0.00276296911761,0.00276296911761,0.00265538785607,0.00264591886662,0.00252041057684,0.00251572648995,0.00233742734417,0.00232656649314,0.00227680662647,0.00220809923485,0.0021260548383,0.0021260548383,0.00211700843647,0.0021102768369,0.0021074609831,0.00198746402748,0.00193224637769,0.00192778650671,0.00186015479267,0.00185586116277,0.0018522386672,0.0018522386672,0.0018522386672,0.0018522386672,0.00184910639655,0.00169360393193,0.00168732693419,0.00168528954964,0.00168528954964,0.00168172456324,0.00168172456324,0.00168014550582,0.00168014550582,0.00163605634589,0.00157351663802,0.00157351663802,0.00157351663802,0.00157351663802,0.0015723768156,0.0015723768156,0.00151632376947,0.00143116456456,0.00143116456456,0.00143012776971,0.00142922846135,0.0014034465421,0.0013956342591,0.00125210708939,0.0012511999812,0.00115274079144,0.00109158537816,0.00100346037652,0.000924942607526,0.000861751788761,0.000854609417729,0.000790754507761,0.000729012768716,0.000686617277097,0.000653004040942,0.000629172893241,0.000550421886146,0.000550421886146,0.000550421886146,0.000550421886146,0.000549940392375,0.000549490388948,0.000549490388948,0.000549490388948,0.00034708037856"

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,57200,"Let me first admit I don't know what ""style"" of noodles this is called - I'm Chinese but these are fairly uncommon, and I've only had them a handful of times. They're not the more traditional hand pulled ones you see at some other places, where they come out thin, stringy and somewhat uniform. They make these by flinging the noodles around, and it comes out non-uniform, with some strands thicker than others, some ends have fat globs of dough, etc Basically, think of a kid that tried to make noodles out of Playdough. It doesn't ""look"" especially pretty, but holy-noodles-batman are these good!They have great texture, the noodle is a bit dense with some good chew, and the thicker ends will remind you of a dumpling dough rather than Chinese noodles. It's different, in a good way, and I like it.  Combine this with cilantro, a very flavourful broth, some tasty lamb and add a pinch of chilli sauce and you have a winner.I'd give it 5* if they gave a slightly bigger portion of lamb.

When I finally sat down with my heaping bowl, I immediately grabbed the spicy concoction they have available at every table. I mixed several heaping spoons of the spicy stuff into my bowl like any other Viet, and right before I dove in, a worker brought over a pile of dinky little napkins for me. I thanked her but was initially confused by all the free napkins.....after about 1/3 through the goodness, I realized my mistake. The spicy concoction didn't burn, but it made my sinuses pour like Niagra. I went through the entire pile of napkins faster than my 2 servings of noodles to the point where I had to clean myself with self-made wet naps. I will be armed with Bounty next time.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,45305,"Ok.  I have to admit, I am addicted to the Lamb Noodle Soups here.  Ever since I first discovered it on the ground level in the very back of the crummy looking building that is the Golden Mall, I've been craving these soups every time I am at Flushing.   If they had a location in Brooklyn, where I live, I swear I might be slurping these noodlely goodness every other day.  Although they have other types of noodles with other toppings, I would go with these since it's what they are known for and it's their name shake.  It's also one of the dishes and places that a little known show called ""No Reservations"" starring some guy named Anthony Bourdain ate at.Delicious and cheap, the noodles costs only $4.50 for the regular serving or you could double the noodles for a buck more.  Served in a cheap take white container whether you eat in or take out, the noodle soup would take a few minutes since they cook it fresh when you make the order.  The hand pulled flat noodle is stretched by hand by one of the workers there and slammed a few times on the table in front of you to give it a springy/chewy texture when eating.  It's then boiled quickly in a homemade broth mixed with a Chinese mushroom called mook ee (sorry, don't know the English name) and cilantro, goji berries and mixed with some regular egg noodles and cellophane noodles, then topped with small chunks of soft lamb meat.  Everything works in harmony with each other, creating a rich, fragrant yet very light and smooth tasting soup. It's one of the few noodle soups that I drink almost to the last drop after eating everything else.  It's that good.Although good by itself already, if you prefer a little spice to your life like I do, there is a chili oil with actual crushed red peppers pieces  on each table that would give it some kick.  There is also vinegar for those that prefer more of sour taste o the broth. I've brought a few friends here over the last year and almost everyone always agrees that these are among the best noodles they ate anywhere regardless of price.  Ok, ok.  One of them said it was only alright.  Still, that's not a negative, right?  I am currently doubting that he have any proper taste buds at all after that comment.Sodas are cheap at $1 each.  Just grab it from a nearby fridge near one of the walls and pay for it.This place also sells some side dishes to accompany your noodle soup such as lamb meat, beef tendon, beef tribe, haggis, tofu, skin, peanuts, and cucumber. I couldn't understand the pricing for these items so the best I could tell you is to point to what you want, and pay what they tell you. Talking about pointing, expect to do that often and you might even need to mime some of what you might want to order unless you speak mandarin.  That's the only language they speak here.  The service is quick and efficient if a bit confusing since there is no line and everyone gathers around the cashier to make their order.  Don't wait for them to ask you to order.  They might not realize you haven't done so among the gathered people waiting for their food.  Just tell them what you want when you see that one of the workers is free.  The interior of the place is small, cramped, with cheap folding chairs and tables with a  non existent decorated interior.  5 star dining this is not.  Don't be afraid to excuse yourself and squeeze by one of the patrons already enjoying their food to get to one of the limited free spots to eat in.  There is very little space between each person and the table or wall behind them.  Two points of advice:-Don't, and I repeat, don't try to look for this place on the lower level where most of the food stalls are located at in this mall. I did that twice when looking for this place before realizing my mistake on my third attempt.  As mentioned, it's on the ground level in the very back of the mall right next to a barber shop.  You will see a Crappy sign in Chinese with a hastily slapped on cardboard signage in English with the words Lamb Noodles written with black markers.  I know.  Classy right?-Don't order the lamb noodle for take out unless you live really close by.  It's best eaten when it's hot and when the hand pulled noodles is still springy when bitten into it.  The longer you wait, the more the noodles absorbs the broth, making the noodles soggy and limp.  Lamb Noodle Soup:  yelp.com/biz_photos/-L7j…",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",5,0,0.0,19.2000007629,"name shake,one,types,ground level,building,Brooklyn,noodle soup,noodles,soups,one,goodness,friends,noodle,pieces,noodle soups,food,location,toppings,Lamb Noodle Soups,Golden Mall,best,vinegar,place,noodles,noodles,one,patrons,Flushing,level,cellophane noodles,egg noodles,noodles,table,hand,dishes,more,serving,times,workers,hand,tasting soup,language,guy,buck,show,one,container,front,mook ee,noodle soup,Everything,each other,table,everyone,order,everything,some,broth,sour taste,broth,place,chili oil,noodles,lamb meat,name,more,price,one,one,English,Lamb Noodles,lamb meat,side dishes,walls,pricing,chunks,mushroom,cilantro,goji berries,harmony,drop,spice,life,peppers,anywhere,taste buds,lamb noodle,noodles,noodles,Chinese,table,cucumber,peanuts,skin,fridge,beef tendon,beef tribe,haggis,tofu,items,mime,No Reservations,Anthony Bourdain,mall,space,wall,people,texture,kick,squeeze,spots,person,most,food stalls,advice,points,attempt,mistake,one,mall,broth,sign,cardboard signage,Sodas,hand,barber shop,markers,right,service,interior,everyone,place,tables,line,star,workers,interior,mandarin,bit,cashier,folding chairs,Crappy,order","7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,5,1,2,2,7,1,7,4,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7","0.137252479792,0.0689128562808,0.0595747195184,0.0404320321977,0.0363876894116,0.0356454886496,0.0243752170354,0.0239531137049,0.0184739120305,0.0178102310747,0.0169552173465,0.0162103660405,0.0128205185756,0.0123856179416,0.0119440453127,0.0117221632972,0.0116695649922,0.0116366613656,0.0110077494755,0.0108106946573,0.00955657474697,0.00924816820771,0.00916834920645,0.00914288591594,0.00914288591594,0.00725071597844,0.00719686225057,0.00693840533495,0.00641771126539,0.0061422502622,0.0061422502622,0.00610796082765,0.005974419415,0.00555095635355,0.00506739132106,0.00506739132106,0.00506739132106,0.00504894927144,0.00504894927144,0.00470777414739,0.00469577684999,0.00459548365325,0.00443358859047,0.00443358859047,0.00443358859047,0.00443096691743,0.00442493427545,0.0044174506329,0.00435530254617,0.00426226155832,0.00407324871048,0.00402193935588,0.00401265453547,0.00400482071564,0.00392499007285,0.00391651457176,0.00387177546509,0.00374173745513,0.00372433452867,0.00372433452867,0.0036505786702,0.00363376969472,0.00349823758006,0.00340321590193,0.00340321590193,0.00338738621213,0.00338420481421,0.00329260108992,0.00329260108992,0.00315940217115,0.00312284822576,0.00308481813408,0.00308481813408,0.00308481813408,0.00308281253092,0.00297741126269,0.00297741126269,0.00297741126269,0.00297741126269,0.00297343637794,0.00296984496526,0.00296657020226,0.00296657020226,0.00296657020226,0.00296077714302,0.00295135728084,0.0028568985872,0.00285494048148,0.00285494048148,0.00276408297941,0.00271140760742,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269882520661,0.00269707036205,0.00269540236332,0.00262464629486,0.00262464629486,0.00251803803258,0.00245531764813,0.0022911184933,0.00224639452063,0.00211732159369,0.00210646167397,0.00200525298715,0.00200525298715,0.0020043910481,0.0020035575144,0.0020035575144,0.0020035575144,0.0020035575144,0.00200275098905,0.00200275098905,0.00177121756133,0.00174175249413,0.0017386386171,0.00164492183831,0.0015835048398,0.00150027498603,0.00147483637556,0.00138582859654,0.00138530391268,0.00138429983053,0.00123479380272,0.00123228481971,0.00120816647541,0.00119051337242,0.00119051337242,0.00108022836503,0.00107753614429,0.00100639951415,0.00100591778755,0.00088280608179,0.000881787855178,0.000881787855178,0.000879995990545,0.000819844019134,0.000782085524406"

The small uses one noodle, and the large uses 2-3 (I forget). I recommend the large because it's under $7, and you will want to eat as much of this stuff as you can. Large portions, fresh noodles, and amazingly clean and flavorful broth. Tastes delicious with or without the house made hot oil. Every time I've been, no one speaks English or Cantonese.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,132504,That was some pretty awesome noodle soup! I decided to try this place after reading all the yelp reviews and it was definitely worth the trip out to Flushing. Handout noodles served with small chunks of tender lamb in a rich broth. I tried it first without the chili oil but then added it for spice. This was good but a little greasy - I probably added too much.

And that's exactly the case at Lamb Noodle Soup.Well, to be fair, they serve lamb noodle soup (naturally) AND beef noodle soup. Don't bother looking or asking for a menu. That's all they've got. The soups only come in small ($4.50) or large ($5.50)... the small uses just one rack of hand-pulled noodles, while the large uses two. Drinks cost a buck each.I ordered the small and it was the perfect size for me. Plenty of noodles, tasty lamb chunks, and a flavorful broth. I added a couple of spoonfuls of hot pepper oil for some extra heat and flavor. I felt the soup could have had more lamb, but hey, you're paying less than $5 for it, so can't be greedy.This place is a complete hole in the wall.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,28549,"Winter is coming. You can feel it by the chill in the air, the shortness of the days and the creaking of your bones. Okay, maybe that last part is just me but... Winter is coming. That means that more days than not you will find me walking into a dingy entrance on the left hand side of a mall where its golden days are the days long past as its exterior has not been cleaned in ages. Walking down a bustling hallway and up a short flight of stairs where there are vendors selling dumplings and scallion pancakes. As if you were transported to another place and you were just another character in a Wong Kar Wai movie. You saunter slowly past them because you know that winter is coming. That means the only sure cure to arm yourself against those seemingly endless cold nights is a bowl of warm soup. Not just any bowl. But lamb noodle soup. Balls of dough lay on the counter oiled, resting and glistening as if they has just been expertly massaged by magic fingers they are soon to be given a dizzying dance of stretching and pulling and whirling and rolled into a pot of hot boiling water suddenly tranformed into the perfect chewy hand pulled noodle as long as the days of summer. With a swirl in the salty bath they are then seized and plopped into a bowl awaiting your pleasure with a friendly cast of characters of wood ear mushrooms, black cloud ear fungus, jewel red goji berries, translucent vermicelli noodles, strands of thin long noodles, a handful of chopped emerald green cilantro and flavorful chunks of lamb. This bowl holds a lot of personality. These flimsy white plastic bowls are full to the brim with a flavorful broth that carries the warmth of spring and hearty enough to give you the strength of a lion and the confidence that you will get through another bitter winter night with a clear head and full gut and cure sluggishness and whatever may ail you. Before seating yourself on a plastic table paired with mismatched stools and diving in and immersing yourself in the comforts of your bowl take note of the hot chili oil that is offered. It is as hot as dragon fire and one little sniff a little too close and it will send a shockwave to your brain. They say that a good bowl of soup is like a warm hug and there is a warmth that pervades your being as you drink down the last spoonfuls of the soup. Maybe if the Lannisters and the Starks hugged it out over a bowl of lamb noodle soup then there would be less bloodshed and tears. If you like mead with your lamb meat this place is also BYOB. There's nothing like pulling a cold Sapporo tallboy out of your jacket pocket to complement your warm soup but other cans of popular sodas and soy milk can be had in the freezer next to the garbage. In case you need to whet your appetite they have trays of crunchy, chilled, pickled dishes like the pickled potato and pickled seaweed that you can order as an appetizer. In case there is some miracle that you do not finish your soup pour it into the strainer next to the garbage can and chuck your bowl into the other garbage. It would help if you spoke the language, mandarin that is, which I do not, but a few hand gestures and pointing at the sign above the counter, they pretty much know why you are here anyways. For the lamb noodle. Just let them know if you want to go big or go small.I believe this tiny shop in such a squalid, unremarkable place is what started the popularity and demand of lamb noodle due to their tv fame which has prompted a price hike but it is still very inexpensive and any person who saves a few coppers will be able to get a bowl. What draws people like Anthony Bourdain to places like this is that there can be good authentic regional food to be found in even the grittiest of settings and has me wandering in here for more each winter, spring and fall. No idea where these flocks of lambs are being raised to supply meat for this new demand but I am glad that I can come here to this unpretentious place for a good solid bowl of soup noodles. Come in here for a bowl of lamb noodle soup because..

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,4766,"Another one of those hidden little spots that gives you a little taste of heaven. Proceed with caution though, because they do not have an English menu and the staff members barely speak anything else other than Mandarin. On the other hand, you know you are in for a treat when you see a very elderly Chinese man stumble in for ""the usual"", and learns that he stops by on the regular basis.I finally had the chance to try out the signature Hui Mian the other day, and I was blown away. The dish was served in a single-use bowl, filled with three types of noodles and small pieces of lamb. The soup, which in my opinion is the most important part, is undoubtedly one of a kind. It's supposedly cooked with lamb bones for hours, which caused the natural fat/oil of the bones to come out and create the milky base, then mixed with spices/Chinese herbs for an unique taste. The wide noodles are great in texture, and I'm usually not even a wider-noodle fan. Then there's the clear vermicelli and perhaps thin egg noodles, which were not present when I tried the same dish in its hometown Zheng Zhou so it was definitely a nice surprise.I'm glad I wandered in on my errands-while-sick day and spent a well worthed $5 that made me feel a whole lot better.

God this place is good. First, a little how-to get to the place:Walk into the first floor of the Golden Shopping Mall and proceed to the back. Across from the beauty salon, you should see a sign that reads: ""Lamb Noodle Soup,"" on it in English.Order the lamb noodle soup upon entrance (you'll want to get the large, trust me) and take a seat. The soup should be ready rather quickly. Load it up with chili oil and Chinese vinegar to your heart's content.The soup is a brilliant mixture of lamb, lamb tendon, cilantro, and various hand-pulled noodles. It's genius. I can't describe it any other way. The broth is thick and you'll be using that spoon in your left hand (you remembered to get a spoon, right?) to slurp up the goodness.  Once you bite into the noodles, you can tell they've been hand-pulled by their texture.These noodles and their broth are simply the best thing on Flushing/Main St. and there are tons of delicious restaurants to try so that's saying a lot.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,194361,"You can tell that the people in this neighborhood work hard to make ends meet, and that quality shows itself, among other ways, in their laboriously hand made noodles. I'd never had hand made noodles (or real, non-gringoized Chinese food) before I came to this place. I'd heard about it on No Reservations and decided that I owed it to the culinary gods to branch out a little and try something that I was unused to. I'm really glad I made the trip. I got the 'small' lamb noodle soup for $4, although the bowl was big enough to fill me up for the entire day. I had the benefit of eating with a friend who had experience with this sort of thing and he suggested that I put in the Chinese vinegar and chili peppers. I sweated, I cried, my nose ran, but all of that was worth the wonderful goodness contained in that bowl. The lamb cuts aren't the best, but given what these people have to work with, I think they pulled off a miracle in soup form. Note that you need to clean up after yourself (my friend and I embarrassed ourselves by leaving our food on the table and then getting yelled at as we tried to leave), and you need to bring cash (we were prepared on that one at least).

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,194136,"My friend and I were in Flushing feeling adventurous, a tad spontaneous, and quite hungry. Since we both visit Flushing a lot and didn't feel like going to our regular spots, we decided to go to Yelp to find a good place to eat. We selected this place due to its location, its one $, and it's 100+ reviews accumulating to a 4.5 star. Thinking we were in for an amazing and inexpensive meal, the hype slowly died down as we got lost trying to find the restaurant. Actually, I'm not even quite sure if this place qualifies as a restaurant. It's more like a shack in the back of a ""flushing mall"". We were so, SOOOOO let down. This place is shabby beyond words, unorganized, and ridiculously dirty. I got on line and attempted to order my food. Attempted because though I spoke in English, the cashier made no attempt to communicate to me in English. Maybe it was because she saw that I was Chinese or maybe it was because she didn't know how to speak even a word of it, but I had a very hard time ordering. Luckily, I ended up getting what I wanted, but I was a bit horrified when I looked over at the cook and kitchen. It was insanely unhygienic, to the point that I was actually worried I would contract some stomach virus as I ate my noodles. At least the price was cheap at $6. As for the food itself, it wasn't horrible but far from fantastic. The broth and lamb were good, but I was bombarded with cilantro and parsley, detracting from the bowl's intended flavored. Unfortunately, I wasn't full from eating and I was left with a very unsettling greasy feeling. As I went to throw my trash out, I saw a bucket on the floor with a strainer for customers to drain their bowls before disposal. Yet again, I was disgusted at the amount of debris in the strainer and the lack of need by the bored cashier to clean anything.

Emphasis on the word MEAL because this soup will fill you up just as much as any hearty entree. The lamb is cooked perfectly, the broth was incredibly flavorful (easily the best broth I've ever tasted) and the handmade noodles were perfect and plentiful. Even the minor details were spot-on. The bowl wasn't overloaded with cilantro, which is something I haven't liked in other similar soups. It also came up really quickly and you just can't beat the price. And at $5, this soup is some of the best bang-for-your-buck food in NYC.About halfway through, I decided to put a tiny bit of chili sauce in my bowl, which was a mistake. It was a little overpowering and the soup is so good by itself that it simply didn't need anything else. Shortly thereafter, though, I dabbed a bit of vinegar in and that balanced the chili out nicely. Still, call me a bland eater, but I preferred the first half of the soup without any of those extras. This was my first trip to Flushing and I, with my bad sense of direction, had some trouble finding it. Make sure you go to the entrance to the Golden Shopping Mall on Main Street.

From TV segments to tours to blogger overload, the ricochet effect is already happening: rising prices, greater use of English in interaction and menus, famous stalls, cleaner digs, and lots of new patrons. One place that has managed to avoid the hooplah, all while remaining consistently wonderful has been Lamb Noodle Soup.Situated in the back where few tend to go, this tiny little stall has just enough seating for 6-8 and has an all Chinese menu. The Chinese name, ""Zibu yangrou huimian"" roughly translates to nutritious/nourishing lamb meat braised noodle, but the name handwritten across the sign,  ""Lamb Noodle Soup"" as its affectionately known, fits much better..Hailing from the Chinese province of Henan, the ladies behind the counter prepare a handpulled noodle their Zhengzhou counterparts would be proud of. Combined with an aromatic broth, the noodles freshly cooked with bits of lamb meat finely chopped and garnished with cilantro and pickled vegetables to create the ultimate $5 noodle soup dish perfect for a winter palate.It is noticeably light and airy, which is quite the opposite from other handpulled noodle spots specialties from other Chinese regions. Leave the rice noodles untouched for a moment, as they have a tendency to soak in the broth and to give a new dimension to the denseness of the noodle and overall flavor. Gaminess isn't a factor in the lamb meat, instead the tenderness complements the dish wonderfully, providing a new dimension in what is already a myriad of texture and taste.Fear not lamb haters, there is the option of beef, chicken, and veggie if the alternative palate can't handle the sheep protein. The noodles are worth it alone, but if the sign / restaurant name wasn't already an indication of what they do best, then one would be hard pressed to find reasons not to try it.",5.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,5.09999990463,"lamb meat,change,plenty,foodie world,ricochet effect,Golden Mall,broth,TV segments,tours,blogger overload,prices,place,back,ladies,Lamb Noodle Soup,bits,Chinese,rice noodles,noodle,stalls,menus,all,noodle,lots,use,interaction,patrons,noodle,hooplah,counterparts,stall,name,noodles,menu,sign,counter,opposite,noodle soup dish,seating,province,cilantro,vegetables,Lamb Noodle Soup.,English,myriad,dish,option,palate,tenderness,noodles,palate.It,reasons,sign / restaurant name,veggie,chicken,beef,lamb haters,Fear,texture,few,dimension,Zibu yangrou huimian,Henan,Zhengzhou,noodle,indication,sheep protein,factor,tendency,specialties,regions,flavor,denseness,dimension,Gaminess","7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,1,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7","0.0750411972404,0.0570234246552,0.0570234246552,0.0570234246552,0.0524539686739,0.0385256372392,0.0324993208051,0.027324674651,0.027324674651,0.027324674651,0.027324674651,0.0264449417591,0.0264449417591,0.0250552035868,0.0235591717064,0.0199137739837,0.0191354136914,0.0178078822792,0.0122835710645,0.0119635239244,0.0119635239244,0.0119023509324,0.0112114232033,0.0104703390971,0.0104703390971,0.0104703390971,0.0104703390971,0.010421491228,0.0104167768732,0.00980982836336,0.00959959533066,0.00880724657327,0.00827539712191,0.00804094877094,0.00801172014326,0.00801172014326,0.00793448835611,0.00731160724536,0.00703630177304,0.00701071741059,0.00639790855348,0.00639790855348,0.00625229440629,0.00620367703959,0.00590451341122,0.00587036600336,0.00583019526675,0.0054407287389,0.0054407287389,0.00541650969535,0.00530366692692,0.00519318925217,0.00493793003261,0.00476048886776,0.00476048886776,0.00476048886776,0.00476048886776,0.00476048886776,0.00476048886776,0.00445959856734,0.004169636406,0.00415207771584,0.00415207771584,0.00415207771584,0.00367029337212,0.00350608350709,0.00286727864295,0.00259071798064,0.00239170598798,0.00209727929905,0.00209727929905,0.002092435956,0.002092435956,0.0016982764937,0.0015141821932"

Here is what you need to know:First - throw your iphone away. It's useless for finding this place. LNS in located inside the Golden Shopping Mall but it's not in the food court which is accessible by two other entrances on the corner of 41Rd and Main St. The way to find this place is to enter through the main entrance of the Golden Shopping Mall which is  on Main St. just about half way between 41Rd and Sanford Ave. Walk all the way towards the end, a couple of steps up the short flight of stairs, and LNS will be on the right, just across from the beauty parlor. Check out the photos I took for reference. I tried to make somewhat of a photo journal but it was dark outside so apologies if it's not too helpful.As for the noodles, they are great. I have never had lamb in soup form and I loved the lamb flavored broth. My only small complaint is the apparent lack of menu. However if you speak Chinese, you can ask them what else they have and they will tell you. Otherwise you are pretty much limited to ordering the lamb noodle in either large or small size. It would be nice if this place was a little more English-friendly, but the noodle soup makes this little discomfort worth it.",4.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,5.90000009537,"place,Golden Shopping Mall,lamb noodle soup,starsBefore,LNS,iphone,place,place,entrances,way,way,complaint,food court,way,couple,entrance,41Rd,corner,right,stairs,flight,end,steps,photos,lamb noodle,beauty parlor,reference,photo journal,apologies,Main St.,place,menu,Sanford Ave,noodle soup,size,discomfort,noodles,lamb,lamb,Chinese,broth,soup form,English,helpful.As","7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,5,7,2,7,5,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7","0.178392142057,0.131911024451,0.106888651848,0.085498355329,0.0755471810699,0.0410522036254,0.0333265550435,0.0224667154253,0.0178357753903,0.0164252389222,0.0162189621478,0.016082894057,0.0156111773103,0.0132112428546,0.0128776794299,0.0120525388047,0.0107739092782,0.010547385551,0.0105176409706,0.0105176409706,0.0105176409706,0.0105176409706,0.0105176409706,0.00966977700591,0.00963011570275,0.00962583720684,0.00960364658386,0.00958492420614,0.00899700261652,0.00805225037038,0.0079555446282,0.00714032584801,0.00624787714332,0.00619064969942,0.00493215210736,0.00492671597749,0.0042510740459,0.00424388470128,0.00424388470128,0.0042225709185,0.00325923226774,0.00313758896664,0.00291675445624,0.00186035514344"
Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,14022,"After not being in this part of Queens for a while, I decided to re-discover places I went to when I was a teenager.Running down from high school into a cyber cafe playing Counter-Strike with 10-15 Asian boys and being the only vagina bearing adolescent there. ""Headshot mader-facker!"" ...ahh memories.....       Anyway, remembering the cyber cafe was inside a mall, I went into the Golden Mall, I walked in and looked around at everything. Other than the smell of body odor amist, I walk up the stairs and smell the pungency of vinegar and chilli oil. I walked upstairs and down a short corridor.       Needless to say, there was a small area, with little to no space, since I apparantly came on a 'busy night' according to the man behind the counter. To my surprise, this place offers quite a bit for the first timer.  I ordered the largest bowl of lamb, broth with everything, and two types of noodles, (no, I have no control when it comes to delicious soups in a bowl). I ordered hand pulled noodles and long noodles together. When I got my order, I shoved the Coriander/Cilantro deep into the bottom of the bowl. I like to eat it last. I added my dressings of vinegar and chilli oil until I was satisfied.     This soup did not fall flat of expectations. The clear vegetable broth, almost like a Consomè, has such an earthy fllavor to it, the lamb is tender, and the noodles are not undercooked. I mean, how could they? Handmade noodles of any sort take 30-60 seconds to cook in boiling hot water. I thought to myself, eating through the bowl halfway, ""I have to get another bowl!"" There is no need my friend. This was so satisfying. I have to come back next time intentionally and try the rest of the items they have to offer.     I never really found the Cyber Cafe that I played Counter-Strike at years ago. Then again, I never really cared to look after I ate the lamb soup.

Lamb Noodle Soup,5375,41-28 Main StGolden Mall,Flushing,11355.0,33418,"Simple, easy, and to the point. As with many other food shops in Flushing, this one particular lamb spot located inside the Golden Mall (you have to walk all the way to the back) boasts a no-frills exploration of just one tiny facet of Chinese cuisine. Lamb holds an important place in the long culinary tradition of Chinese culture. Muslim populations from Northwestern China no doubt contributed greatly to the popularization of lamb in Chinese cuisine, and you can follow this trail of lamb-related deliciousness from Xinjiang to Xi'an, and all the way to the lamb kabobs of Beijing. When you walk into a place like this, the key is to not feel intimidated and order whatever everyone else is ordering. I assure you that it'll be delicious.

The moment I walked in and was seated we were greeted by a woman who was very friendly and sat us down. We had started to order when she started suggesting other things and kept pushing us to try something else saying how much better it was and that the smoke would be thicker and smoother. She told us it was only $3 more so we said ok an ordered it. (it was not only $3 more) It took a while to get the hookah and when it finally arrived and we tried it, it was nothing like she had said. The smoke was barley coming out and it was terrible. I also ordered a brownie which came with ice cream on top of it and I have to say it was the most disgusting brownie I have ever eaten. It just did not taste right. When the waitress came over to see how I liked it, I told her honestly that it was terrible and I did not like it. The waitress just gave me a dirty look an walked away. From then on her whole attitude changed and she was no longer friendly with us. The prices are also a little high. A brownie with icecream was $4.99....

The fries that accompanied our meals had been fried and refried several times, some dark and crunchy, all were badly overcooked.

The decor is different and the seating is also really comfortable. We were greeted as soon as we entered, and the menus were brought to us immediately. Since it was our first time here, we decided to try something simple, and ordered a watermelon mint hookah ($10). The hookah was amazing, the pull was thick and smooth, and it lasted us over 2 hours without getting harsh. Coal change is a problem I face in most lounges, however someone was constantly making rounds to see if we had enough coals. They were playing decent music throughout the night and I like how it didn't get too loud. My only complaint would be the fact that their wifi wasn't working.

But anyway i was so happy i finally got to try this place, the owner was so friendly. It was packed no shock, but he called me personally on my cell 10 mins later with a table ready for me and my girlfriend. The place itself is small but the seats are arranged in a way where u wont feel too cramped, unless u have a large group. The place has good music, very cute decor, a clean bathroom, a very friendly waitress who always checked on me to see if i was okay. The coal was being refilled without me asking until after 1:30 am the worker sat down and chilled, i guess since many people had left at that point he didnt wanna be bothered, but overall the hookah itself does last long. The cold hose is totally worth it, it really makes a smooth difference. The fresh fruit options are endless, gives a nice kick to the flavor! I never tried the food here, but the teas are done perfectly here! It sucks that they dont have any cocktails it would definetly bring them more business but since theres so many young teens anyway who are definetly under 21 maybe its not such a good idea after all lol . A totally young crowd in sweatpants and hoodies while the girls are dressed up in heels, theres totally no dress code requirement here.

Yes, I was determined to not be disappointed, and after the day I had, I needed something good, so I took a drive here to chill and smoke. When I arrived, parking was easy, so that was a plus.  Once I walked in, the decor was very hip, as well as pretty relaxing too.  The waitress came up and greeted me right away, had me seated quickly, and I sunk into the comfy seating area.  One of the things I love about this place is that they serve hookah on a watermelon head or pineapple head, and I was curious to try how a watermelon head was going to be, as this is something even I haven't tried.  I've had many a fruit heads with hookah before, and I was delighted it was so good!  This place also has what's called ""cold hose.""  I've seen it once or twice before, but never tried it.  Until now.  I am in love with the cold hose, and yes the extra money you have to pay is sooooo worth it.  Especially if you are unfamiliar with smoking hookah, or it makes you cough frequently, or you just don't like the burn of the hookah smoke, then please, try cold hose.  I had mint watermelon in a watermelon head, with milk, and cold hose, and yes indeed I was in hookah heaven, and after a puff or two, well maybe three, I was the most relaxed I had been in quite a while.  This was some of the best hookah that I've had in quite a long time, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. I had taken a look at the menu, but wasn't really hungry, so I just ordered hot tea, and sat back to enjoy the ride. I got just the right amount of attention from my waitress, and when I was ready for more coals, I didn't even have to ask because there was a very nice guy roaming around with fresh coals, he just came up and refreshed my coals. Now that's something that most hookah places just don't do anymore, which I miss terribly.  Here, gone are the days for waiting ages for new coals to come out, and by the way, they don't use the round crappy self lighting coals either, which are bonus points in my hookah book.  Overall, great place, decent location, and wonderful hookah.  Try the watermelon head, its great for summertime, with a light, refreshing flavor.  And definitely, try the cold hose, even I was pleasantly surprised at how much it takes the smoke burn away.  I'll be back!!",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,12.8000001907,"battery,someone,parking,hookah,recommendation,hookah expert,bonus points,phone,review.,course,something,place,something,something,hookah,some,waitress,watermelon head,cold hose,smoke,watermelon head,waitress,hookah,decor,hookah,smoking hookah,drive,hip,seating area,pineapple head,watermelon head,cold hose,cold hose,watermelon head,cold hose,mint watermelon,hookah smoke,money,burn,cold hose,things,coals,coals,hookah places,milk,heaven,puff,fruit,hookah,guy,way,ages,self lighting coals,place,smoke burn,light,hookah book,location,summertime,flavor,coals,look,experience,menu,tea,attention,ride,amount","7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,6,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7","0.144979968667,0.12054015696,0.0628719553351,0.0624436698854,0.0427657626569,0.040953360498,0.0377673208714,0.0358831472695,0.0358831472695,0.0358831472695,0.0295729693025,0.0237567126751,0.0227719452232,0.0196477901191,0.017618695274,0.017288338393,0.0131916347891,0.0123523529619,0.00943621154875,0.00886349566281,0.00882340595126,0.00819486100227,0.00805083289742,0.00775890098885,0.00763843487948,0.00758649455383,0.00725477514789,0.00649861618876,0.00648027891293,0.00626892456785,0.00626892456785,0.00624612672254,0.00622098706663,0.0056811561808,0.0056811561808,0.0056811561808,0.00535548850894,0.0053057516925,0.00507274921983,0.00485040154308,0.00436558853835,0.00423391023651,0.00407596863806,0.00398399261758,0.00395605433732,0.00395605433732,0.00395605433732,0.00374238821678,0.00357206631452,0.00314076221548,0.002943465719,0.002943465719,0.00292723812163,0.00275461282581,0.00270678452216,0.00232618977316,0.00203783949837,0.00203644274734,0.00203511863947,0.00195915042423,0.00185722764581,0.00150656769983,0.0014802608639,0.00129386340268,0.00129386340268,0.00129280472174,0.00127755582798,0.000953500217292"

If you watched Rugrats when they were all grow'ed up, Lamoza is NOT the place for you given the minimum age of 18.I have been hesitant to write this review, largely because I grew up 1 of 9, am NOT a middle child, and yet am selfish with my personal space. That said, I have been frequenting Lamoza on median 5 - 6 days a week for the past 2 years, so as a reader you may consider this review apropos. Or late, but in that case, f* your couch.Management is impeccable, particularly Amir who literally rolls up his sleeves to ensure everything is running seamlessly. The focus is always on ambiance and service, even at the risk of new business (so if you are ratchet so to speak, please look up hookah places in the city). Coupled with the fact that Lamoza has been voted best hookah place in Bay Ridge, yet it took some cajoling to get Amir to display this accomplishment - it speaks volumes to the humility and business sense he exudes.But that's not what you have come to Yelp to hear. Not only does the quality of hookah eclipse that which you would get from the City (""regulars"" from all boroughs frequent Lamoza), Sunday - Thursday there are deals above and beyond the lower-than-standard average price per person. Coal change is generally quick / available upon request, and the menu for Lamoza has been expanded beyond the standard bar fare. In fact, I recommend the Jalapeno Lamoza Burger, which will assuredly make you feel weirdly satiated but like a cow afterwards - sometimes you are what you eat!This establishment has Wi-Fi and largely plays Top 40 / Hip Hop, making it ideal for work, conversation and / or general leisure.

Lan Ting Hotpot BBQ,5377,705 59th StSte BC,Brooklyn,11220.0,41668,"I came here with a big group and all of us can say that we enjoyed having hotpot here. This is one of the better AYCE hot pot spots around the 8th Ave area. Something that makes this place stand out from other hot pot spots is that their hot pots are covered with decorated Chinese porcelain. This made their food taste that much better ;). The soup bases come with mushrooms and other miscellaneous ingredients that gives it a homemade feel. A plate of free appetizers (chicken feet, edamame, seaweed salad) is also served before the soup and other stuff gets to the table. The ingredients that they serve here are very fresh. Their fatty beef is the perfect cut and has the perfect thinness, but one complaint I have is that they did not bring out enough. We ordered other things from the menu and didn't get the fatty beef until 30 mins into the dinner. The veggies and frozen items came out fast. The first plate of fatty beef was gone in a second and they would not send out another plate for another 20 minutes. I made sure to emphasize that we wanted more than 1 plate, but they didn't get the message. This won't stop me from coming here because they do have a good selection of items to choose from. One unique item they have here is the slippery shrimp (I know, funny name. Even my friends and I laughed every time I ordered it). It is essentially shrimp paste and is delicious. We probably had at least 6 servings of that. They also have my favorite 3 second fried tofu skin. Many places charge extra for this. To end the meal, they give a scoop of ice cream for free. The total per person without tax and tip is about $22, which isn't too bad.

Our servers were on point, they checked on us regularly, refilled our soups etc. The food was so fresh, and the clams were massive. Honestly the biggest clams I've ever seen and they were quite tasty. The Chinese herbal soup was also great, they definitely have been stewing that soup for a while and the quality reflects that.

My friends ended up getting there way later than estimated and the staff was very accommodating in making sure I would have a table once my friends were there, regardless of when they got there. you should definitely call ahead to make reservations bcsometimes they cannot accommodate walk ins (or your wait time would be very long). i saw them turn away people when they arrived as a party of 2, bc the only tables they had available were for 6. They did ask people if they would be ok with sharing in case a smaller party came by and as long as you were ok with that, they would seat you. Food - fresh and good portions. Yes, this is all you can eat, but some places will give you really small portions so you have to constantly order. this was not the case here, they gave out sizeable portions each time and will tell you how many pieces each order is so that you can decide if you need to order more. Taste - fresh, and soup base was good. Friend ranked his pork bone base 7/10 and my herbal was more of a 8.5/10. Flavorful and did not taste like water, the taste intensified with the more items I put in my pot. We got the individual small pots for our hot pot.

When it comes to AYCE hot pot, I always look at 4 things - the broths, the dipping sauces, the freshness of ingredients, and the variety of ingredients. Starting with the broth - there are different types and I tried the spicy one as well as the original pork bone one. I liked both. Although the broths at Lan Ting are not significantly better than other good places', I'd say they are all very decent.I love some of the special dipping sauces that you cannot normally get from other hot pot places, like the mushroom one and the green pepper one. I do hope the sesame paste could be a little less thick though. What makes Lan Ting my favorite is the freshness and the variety of the ingredients. The cut of the fatty beef is spot on and the crispy pork tastes very good (yes you can eat it directly too). Seafood is very fresh. To my surprise, unlike other places, the shrimp spread (虾滑) and crispy tofu skin (响铃) are included the in the AYCE menu here. Also, my girlfriend really likes the Taiwanese pancake (台湾手抓饼).Besides food itself, the service is also top notch.

So definitely make a reservation!!!Finally came here after making reservations and we sat downstairs. Its a pretty spacious restaurant. The design of the restuarant is alittle confusing (lots of fruity colors mixed w dark colors..). One unisex bathroom downstairs.Their menus have pictures (yay!) and i always get spicy soup base. The spicy soup base here is actually spicy so i loved it! My gf got the pig bone base which she said wasnt much taste.The sauce station is awkwardly located where the TV area is. And they didnt really have a signature sauce. They did have a hot pot sauce but it was thick and only had soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil to thin it out.

If you arrive at prime dine time or even a little later than that, the wait can be long. Since it's AYCE, everyone is trying to eat their money's worth. You put your name down with the hostess and she'll give you a number to hold onto. Once your table is ready she'll call your number.For $22/person, you get to choose your own personal soup base, as much meat, seafood, dumplings, noodles, and veggies as you want, and access to the unlimited sauce bar. The variety of hot pot goodies may not be as diverse as other hot pot places, but at least they have all the basics - sliced meat, fish balls, etc. They don't have my ultimate favorite, fish ball stuffed with roe, but the slippery shrimp paste and fish tofu sufficed. If there's one thing to know about me, it's that I will never say no to sauce. Lan Ting has an impressive spread of sauces, which you can customize to fit your taste. I like the mix of Chinese BBQ sauce, sesame oil, scallions, cilantro, and raw minced garlic.This is a Chinese-run establishment, so knowing how to speak either Cantonese or Mandarin is helpful. Our waitress spoke to me in Mandarin and some broken English. While I understood her, I don't speak Mandarin well so I resorted to a lot of pointing, which was fine.

You get individual pots and they assist with skimming the oil out of your pot. The food was fresh enough, though sometimes they could have given more pieces based on how many people.

The place may seem small through the window, but they also have a lower level so don't be afraid to reserve for big parties here.  For $22 pp they offer a nice variety of soup base and food. They offer items that are not available at other AYCE hotpot places as well. Such as fried tofu skin rolls, shrimp slip, and huge clams. Soup base was tasty and food was fresh.  Service was 5/5! Our server, the guy with the silver hair, was super attentive despite our hectic table of 18. He came back multiple times to check up on us making sure we had everything we ordered. He was also super quick with giving me another wet nap after I had just finished eating my shrimp and crab. The rest of the staff was also super friendly and the best part was they speak mandarin, cantonese, anddd english! They also offer free hair ties for the females that struggle with their hair in their faces.

Lan Ting Hotpot BBQ,5377,705 59th StSte BC,Brooklyn,11220.0,6504,"Came here at the beginning of this month to celebrate my lil bro birthday. My cousin treated us here and gave a really generous tip I heard. Anyways, since one of my bestie lives around the block, I saw this place renovating before it ever opened for business and knew I had to go try it. My bestie went here without me to try and said the food was so so and told me to not bother going. however, I am head strong and like to be my own judge.  Some of the points he told me does hold true, however, I have a different opinion than him. I actually give this establishment 3.5 stars but since there are no half star ratings so they get 4 stars. Yelp should start adding half star ratings into their system. The inside decor is contemporary yet small. Looks like downstairs have more. But didn't go look to see what was there. Maybe a party room? Karaoke? Not sure. Upstairs is where we ate at. It rain the day we went there. The waitress asked if I wanted to place my umbrella in the outside pail, I declined and said I wanted it next to me. They seemed okay with it although hesitate. The staff was friendly and even came to ask us how we know of the place and what we thought of our meal. Maybe cause they overheard that I am a yelp reviewer. But I did enjoy the friendly chitchat. Overall service however needs some improvement hence they lost one star for that. When my soup was overflowing with oil from the meats, servers didn't come over to remove the foam layer. Other places like Laojie (老街) does come to check often and remove; and 99 flavor taste provides the scooper and pail for you to do yourself and does sometime do it for you too. This place should at least provide that if they can't be attentive to remove for the customer. In addition, the servers only came to remove after they over heard us talking about it. I even did a test to see if they would do it without me asking. Well they failed that test. Next came the soup base, as my bestie complained to me that one of the things he didn't like about this establishment was that the soup base is not flavorful like 99 flavor taste. He was right. Their soup base is a little lacking. In addition their spicy soup base that my cousin order is way too spicy. They probably should offer mild spicy and provide additional spicy sauce on the side for the customer. That would be a better way to do it. The sauces they had was very nicely presented, however they were not abundant like 99 flavor taste and Hangout 58. They should provide more varieties. But I did enjoy their own herb created sauces. That was genius! The food looked and tasted fresh. My favorite was their tofu skin rolls. They presented it very well in rolls while other places presents it in big slice pieces. I prefer the roll presentation. Taste better and easier to cook in the hotpot. So that was my favorite of all the foods offered. Overall it's a very basic hotpot place. Would I come again, probably. P.S. I did have stomach pain and had to use the bathroom after eating. But I am not sure if it's from the food at this place as I do have a sensitive stomach.

Anywhos they have a pretty decent amount of selections for AYCE but of course if you want certain types of seafoods and etc there would be additional charge. Because the pots were so small, the server literally refilled our soup base about 5-6 times which by then you can barely taste your soup base. The waiters were pretty friendly.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles,5378,136-20 Roosevelt AveNew World Mall Food Court,Flushing,11354.0,194038,"I am very impressed. For $6.50, you get hand pulled noodles cooked at perfect texture and chewiness, a rich, herbal-ly flavorful (anise) broth- yet not too salty, a good 1/3-1/2lbs portion slices of beef flank and tendons- stewed to perfect savory tenderness... The pickled collard greens and hot sauce are free, both very very authentic taste, lots of rich garlic and colorful spices in the hot sauce, something I rarely see outside of Asia. They also use them up very quickly so it's replenished and freshly made everyday. Only minor complaint is the sparse amount of vegetables in the broth, bit more bok choy and scallions would be nice... Still, for $6.5, I should really stfu with any complaints. This is arguably one of the best dishes in one of the best booths from within one of the very best Chinese food courts that exists in the US.I've tried just about every booth at New World Mall Food Court. The only comparably excellent booth to Li's Lanzhou is Zheng Zhou Lamb Noodle Soup. And this is more of a personal opinion, but I like Li's Lanzhou's beef noodles over Zhen Zhou lamb noodle. They're both really really good, and both $6.5. It's mind boggling when you think about how much other places in NY, Boston, or SF charge for a good bowl of noodles (if you read my other reviews, ramen for $30!? Yes there are such places...

Went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was very crowded and a little overwhelming but once you get acclimated it's time to find the cleaner looking stalls and start eating. You cannot think about how clean it does or doesn't look; just accept it. We found this noodle spot which looked decent and had a man hand-pulling the noodles near the register. Ordered the beef fried ramen dish for I believe $7.99. It was enough food for two people. I had already planned on avoiding the meat chunks because I didn't know how legit the meat would be. I was totally surprised that the meat was of a good quality and so I was able to fully partake. The noodles were sautéed in a brown sauce and combined with the beef and several veggies, red and green peppers, tomatoes, exotic mushrooms, and boy choy.  The dish was really scrumptious- the noodles were so fresh tasting and had the right elements of chewiness.  We ate the whole damn thing.

At first, I didn't mind that they forgot, I'd just prefer that they pick it out with chopsticks at least, but in this case, I would've picked it out myself. So, the girl at the register reminds the lady in the back that I ordered with no cilantro, so they take it back, pour the soup out, add water, pour more out so that the cilantro is poured out with it (I lost some veggies from this). I guess all of that wasn't good enough because she used her hand with the glove and picked more out (who knows what that glove touched), then she saw more, so she took a towel that was sitting on the side and wiped more cilantro out (we all know that towel wasn't clean). And, I guess there was still more so she used her fingernail (no glove) to pick them out (definitely not clean). I am disgusted at how they handled the simple ""no cilantro"" request. It could've easily been handled with chopsticks, which I would've just done myself if I had known she was going to use all of those methods to get the cilantro out.I gave them 2 stars because I ordered their dumplings and tried my sisters dish, which was a cold noodle dish with beef.

Judging from that, this place's beef noodle needs some work. (Sorry to be harsh) This review is for those who have been to at least 10 different Lanzhou noodle shops in China. If this is your first or your first few, you will be okay with it.Beef pieces are the best in the dish, well seasoned and flavorful, but NOT the type of beef you would be given in a traditional lanzhou noodle. Traditionally, the beef is simply seasoned with salt and spices, should be pale in color and thinly sliced. They overdid this one by going through some sort of soy sauce bath... the color is way too dark for a typical Lanzhou beef noodle.Noodle is not bouncing/chewy, although they are constant in shape (noticeably thicker, probably need to push dishes out in a hurry due to the constant quene). Dough recipe needs a lot of work, or the line cook cooked them for a tad too long. Noodle was the first thing that needs to be perfect, because its texture accounts for 90 percent of the dish.Now to the soup that needs to take up 100 percent of the flavors: def not slow cooked, salty, and not clear in apperance.At last, where is the daikon radish, and why am I seeing green Shanghai bakchoy?

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles,5378,136-20 Roosevelt AveNew World Mall Food Court,Flushing,11354.0,11150,"Located in the basement belly of New World Mall, where the cavernous and cacophonous food court lies, Li's Lanzhou Hand Stretched Noodles is a stall that provides a dinner and a show. Before ordering, I spent a few amused minutes watching the noodle master stationed at the front wrestling with an enormous ball of dough, stretching, slamming, and whipping it into submission until it was shredded into noodles and boiled for a new order of noodles. I was impressed enough to get in line to place my order of vegetable noodles in soup, with amounted to a paltry $5 and was ready within minutes. Three condiments are available at the pickup counter - a jar of pickled vegetables, a bowl of spicy chili oil, and a bottle of vinegar. As the picture of my bowl might suggest, I helped myself to some generous spoonfuls of the spicy oil.  At first glance, the vegetable noodle is a disappointment. Neither the toppings (wood ear mushrooms, a handful of baby bok choy, slices of tomato, and a hardboiled egg) nor the serving size seem particularly notable. For me, the light and uninteresting broth was helped enormously by the addition of spice and it wasn't until I reached the noodles at the bottom of the bowl that my taste buds woke up. Hand pulled noodles were a first for me and I found the texture toothsome - pliable and all of the stretching worked the gluten in the dough to make the ramen uniquely chewy. There was a good amount of it hiding below the broth, so that by the time I reached my last bite, I was pretty full. Service here is quick, if a little unfriendly. The cashier in the front who takes orders calls out to those passing by in Chinese, presumably to lure them to the stall. But once you get there, she is unsmiling and the interaction is about as warm as a glacier. Still, efficiency is to be appreciated - money gets handed over, she screams your order to the cooks in the back, and high turnover of noodle production ensures that your food will come out quickly. Though the noodles themselves were delicious, I found the broth and the accompanied toppings just okay. For the price, it was a decent meal and I'd love to come back and (based on other Yelp reviews) try some of their fried noodles and dumplings.",3.0 star rating,"The Woodlands, TX",3,1,0.0,7.30000019073,"Lanzhou Hand Stretched Noodles,New World Mall,noodle master,stall,broth,food court,vegetable noodle,basement belly,show,cashier,dinner,Li,wrestling,noodles,noodles,vegetable noodles,noodles,meal,order,order,dough,noodles,jar,submission,ball,soup,line,vegetables,bowl,bowl,handful,toppings,orders,bottle,chili oil,bowl,oil,Hand,bottom,dough,food,pickup counter,vinegar,picture,spoonfuls,glance,serving size,hardboiled egg,tomato,slices,baby bok choy,wood ear mushrooms,light,spice,addition,condiments,all,order,taste buds,stretching,ramen,texture,gluten,some,noodles,interaction,efficiency,turnover,stall,glacier,noodle production,money,back,cooks,broth,toppings,price,reviews,dumplings,noodles,Service,amount,bite,front,Yelp,Chinese","6,2,7,7,7,3,7,7,5,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.198374807835,0.093780964613,0.0916212424636,0.044197384268,0.0438526943326,0.0433559678495,0.0350452624261,0.0313266515732,0.0313266515732,0.0309853851795,0.0240700393915,0.0186334438622,0.0149750709534,0.010329850018,0.010329850018,0.0102770598605,0.00917989667505,0.00830114353448,0.00774662336335,0.00770699372515,0.00654835999012,0.00627711135894,0.00582594750449,0.00573035655543,0.00573035655543,0.00570101756603,0.00570101756603,0.00481950724497,0.00481950724497,0.00480590667576,0.00478547113016,0.00457915198058,0.00455299997702,0.00438389647752,0.00438389647752,0.0043720616959,0.00437152292579,0.00436554383487,0.00397682795301,0.00397089868784,0.00394873367622,0.00383585132658,0.00383585132658,0.00382502237335,0.00382502237335,0.00381619716063,0.00380875146948,0.00380875146948,0.00380875146948,0.00380875146948,0.00380875146948,0.00380875146948,0.00380231323652,0.00380231323652,0.00380231323652,0.00360038876534,0.00351871550083,0.00349125708453,0.00347960041836,0.00347441108897,0.00347441108897,0.00347441108897,0.00347441108897,0.00338603835553,0.00322046456859,0.00316471001133,0.00316173932515,0.00296760722995,0.00295620458201,0.00258383015171,0.0025814040564,0.0025814040564,0.0025814040564,0.0025814040564,0.00224407343194,0.00204105046578,0.00178421963938,0.00178421963938,0.00178421963938,0.00139599863905,0.00139112805482,0.00135792780202,0.00113701168448,0.00113438547123,0.00105609674938,0.000671381596476"

That's when I venture to Lanzhou Handmade Noodle. Their most popular dish is listed as #1 on their menu: the beef noodle soup. I've only tried one other noodle soup there (wonton), and it doesn't compare to the wonton noodle soups I've had elsewhere. But the beef noodle soup here can give that of other restaurants a run for the money. Each bowl comes with a lot of noodles, which you actually can see the guy in the stall make, and a good amount of ingredients. The only reason I'm taking one star off is because of the lack of order at this place. Their receipts aren't numbered, so there is always a crowd of people at the stall waiting for their order, and I'm sure people have walked away with someone else's order once or twice just because they ordered the same thing. Also, because the receipts aren't printed, sometimes customizations (like no scallions) are overlooked, but I think that mainly happens when it's so busy that they're just crunching out the orders routinely.

The first time was after they switched over to new management and were offering $3 noodles with chicken. Wifey was all over this deal but I skipped it to get food from another stall. I did try some of hers and it was pretty good so I bookmarked them to try later.Next time I was in NWM, I headed straight for their stall and ordered the spicy beef w/ sliced noodle. As soon as the soup came out I noticed how good it smelled. I could smell the cilantro stems and the star anise even before I got near my tray. Tasted pretty good too. The wood ear mushrooms and the beef went well together. The beef was very tender and took a lot of flavor from the broth.The noodles themselves were chewy and tasty. I usually prefer the sliced version rather than the pulled version cuz they hold up their texture better in the hot broth. I think I would have been fine getting the pulled noodles here because the broth wasn't crazy hot and had cooled down a lot by the time I was done with the dish. I just wish it was less oily though that didn't stop me from adding more chili oil.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles,5378,136-20 Roosevelt AveNew World Mall Food Court,Flushing,11354.0,154949,"Way overrated...People talk as if the hand pulled noodle soups here are just shy of miraculous. Not.Don't get me wrong; the noodles in and of themselves are good. As any fresh made noodle should be. It's a craft; they're pretty good at it in the industrial sense. Decent texture, nice chew, etc.. Nothing to write home about though. Pasta/noodles are simple once you learn the basics. Elevating it to the artisan level takes a profound effort and you don't find that here. This is blandly pedestrian.The broth? Eh. My homemade pho blows their standard beef broth away. I know it's not a Vietnamese place, but the soup is in the same ballpark, with that touch of anise, therefore I'm comparing it to pho.I sampled both the mutton soup and the beef soup.

This is NOT Li's Lan Zhou Hand Stretched noodles.  They are actually located right next to one another.  I believe this site was a more recent arrival and I'm clearly a bigger fan of this one. The noodles are about equal for the two restaurants. Very chewy, home-made and just the right amount of bite.   Lanzhou Hand made noodle had better beef and broth though.   The beef was more savory and obviously tender.  The tendon was cooked to perfection.  The broth was also richer, more flavorful and a darker color. Definitely my style.Would recommend the knife cut noodle slices.The picked mustard greens are too tart and pungent for my liking.

It is a huge food court in Flushing that opened maybe this year or last year. There are definitely A LOT of people who go to this food court because of the location. And especially since there are so many food choices here in this food court. And the food are all affordable too for the community. Of course, they are all Asian food choices, specifically Chinese food from different villages and ethnicities in China. So this Langzhou Handmade Noodles have some delicious and cheap noodles! And they are handpulled noodles made fresh on the spot. Where else are you going to find that nowadays. It's a skill and art to be mastered. I've tried the beef and the lamb noodle soup. The meat is chewy, but still good.I just don't like the fact that there are way too many people in this food court at all times, especially dinner time. And it's hard to get seats even with the large amount of seating there are here.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles,5378,136-20 Roosevelt AveNew World Mall Food Court,Flushing,11354.0,5849,"New World Mall Food Court has had a flurry of Lanzhou hand-pulled noodle establishments set up. It sort of became to the point where they were all the same and none had an advantage over another. But since I haven't been to the newly established Li's Lanzhou Hand-Stretched Noodles yet, I decided to give it a try. The food court had just opened at 10:30 AM and I was one of the first customers to order.#7 - Lamb and small sweet red bulbs with choice of Shanxi sliced noodles, Lanzhou hand-stretched noodles or steamed noodles for $6.00. I opted for the hand-stretched noodles. The broth was clean and refreshing, yet very flavorful. The abundant portion of noodles did not muddle the broth at all.  It included green vegetables, seaweed shaped in noodle form, cloud ear mushrooms, chopped cilantro, noodles, and several thin slices of lamb. The lamb was tender, some pieces slightly salty while others were under seasoned. But despite the slight difference in seasoning, the lamb was very tasty. The seaweed and cloud ear mushroom helped to give it some crunchy texture.#4 - Spicy Beef with choice of Shanxi sliced noodles, Lanzhou hand-stretched noodles or steamed noodles for $6.00. I opted for the hand-stretched noodles. Ingredients were the same as the Lamb Noodle Soup (green vegetables, seaweed, cloud ear mushroom, and cilantro). The broth was slightly richer, through the addition of the chili oil which did add a decent amount of spice to the broth.

You can get the noodles spicy or mild, but I'm not a fan of overly spicy foods. The mild is flavorful enough.

I did a spin around all the stalls in the New World Mall Food court and decided to get some of Li's noodles. After watching the free show, with the noodle meister pulling clumps of dough into noodle, I felt compelled to try the fresh pasta. It was obviously authentic, unlike some of the Chinatown places that I've witnessed use a machine for their ""hand pulled"" ! This dough was pulled by a man who must use Ben Gay Gel at night, and made with passion and endurance. Noodle chef must have made a batch a minute. He'd stretch and stretch and then run to the kitchen behind him every time a handful was finished.Li's noodles are the real deal, chewy, delicious strands of wheat in soups, in stir fries. Take your pick from the many choices. Most people ordered some kind of beef in a broth, decorated with cilantro. I watched the people who bought, everyone seemed happy. And sated. I bought the tomato and egg, and received a huge bowl of noodles, topped with a heaping portion of shredded cucumbers. Add your condiments. To the right of the stall is a little table with chili oil, a pot of pickled vegetables, and a vinegared soy sauce. One lady, only speaking Spanish, kept pointing to the chili, with a question, picante, picante? Hey, this is Flushing where all ethnicities reap the benefits of each other's cuisine, and English is not required. And my noodles? Delicious. I surmise there is always a wait. Put in your order on the left side, wait on the right for your meal to come out. Watch the performance and the wait seems to shorten. Or eye the crowds to scope out your next meal. Be patient.

We had noodles and the giant dumpling that's really 8 regular sized dumplings fried together. The noodles were alright but the fried dumplings were the best fried dumplings I've encountered in NYC! Aside from Japanese gyoza, most fried dumplings I've had are too doughy, or at the very least the dough wrapper is too thick for my preference. I love delicate, thin dumpling wrappers that only serve to encase a scrumptious filling. So I'm often disappointed when I try other dumpling shops that people rave about. Not even Vanessa's dumpling shop or Prosperity dumpling gave me what I was looking for. But when I tried these dumplings, I knew I found exactly what I've been looking for. The wrapper is thin but enough to hold the filing. And the filing is delicious. It's really just pork and scallions but it's so tasty!

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodles,5378,136-20 Roosevelt AveNew World Mall Food Court,Flushing,11354.0,2104,"As much as I love New World Mall for its incredible variety of regional Chinese cuisines, I loathe its lack of consistency for food, service, and even price (sometimes just subject to change) (#1). Lanzhou Handmade Noodle has remained surprisingly consistent - few lines if ever, street stall worthy prices, and decent quality for a majority of their noodle dishes.It may be easy to dismiss it because it's probably the nicest Lanzhou in the area. That's not really boasting, it's merely highlighting how divey the rest of them are. Seeing as every handpulled noodle joint wants to be associated with the Lanzhou name, I can't vouch if this stall is part of the same family in Golden Mall or Manhattan/Brooklyn Chinatown.What I can vouch for is a solid beef noodle soup (niu rou mian). The broth seems light yet flavorful and the noodles tasted fresh, somewhat al dente with a nice texture. While it's not the greatest zha jiang mian (uh ... Chinese bolognese?) I've ever had, $5 was all it took for a nice helping that filled me up nicely. It was a good plop of stewed beef bits, lathering up the bed of noodles underneath with a few slices of cucumber on top for presentation props.

We ordered a spicy cumin lamb burger, lamb pulled noodles, beef noodles, and garlic eggplant.The spicy cumin lamb burger was standard and fair. The bun was way too crunchy for my liking. Crunchy to the point where the gums would hurt a bit from chewing. It would be like a 3.5 stars. Eggplant was pretty bomb. The eggplant was cold but the sauce had garlic, oil, soy sauce, scallion, and sesame seeds. Tasty. The sauce was warm (temperature wise). It was a contrast of hot and cold...interesting. This was good because the garlic also wasn't overpowering. The chili sauce on the side of the table wasn't too great...The beef noodles were nicely flavored. The beef was tender.  The noodles were chewy. The soup was also nice. However, I feel like they skimped a bit on the beef  (as well as the lamb). The lamb noodles soup was a bit fattier. The lamb was a bit gamier. However, when asked tea or water, we sad water but were given tea. It's like the tea they give you at sushi places... All in all, not bad. Would I come back?

Thinking it came with the order, I said fried egg, then when I got the receipt it said noodles ($7.50) and fried egg (+$1). And the egg wasn't all that appetizing looking. The act of doing that was just not cool, could've just said an extra dollar and you get to pick your choice of egg. I still would've gotten one but this made me feel like I was cheated. Anyways, there were a lot of beef tendons but they were all cut in thin small slices/pieces. A lot of cilantro and scallion over the little amount of noodles in that bowl of soup.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,5379,4128 Main StGolden Shopping Mall,Flushing,11355.0,194122,"So for my first review I have chosen this place because it is very special to me. I actually disliked authentic Chinese food for the longest time. But since I have been dating a Chinese guy, it has consistently been a part of my diet. It's definitely an acquired taste to be eating food from another culture and eventually it clicked for me. Now it's all I ever crave. After going to New York City 3 times this past year, I have to say this is by far my favorite restaurant. I highly recommend starting off with some kabobs with meat of your choice. My fiancé always orders for me in Chinese so I've never actually talked to the owners or cooks. But the menu is big and not hard to read. Next, go with the beef noodles. Add a little of the red pepper sauce on the table to make it spicy and you're good to go. You'll never be the same. It's amazing. Now, this place is not clean. There's no lie that the golden mall needs a touch up. But it doesn't even freaking matter because once you know there is amazing food in there you will do anything to get to it.

I was repulsed by the overall appearance and location of the place, downstairs, tucked away along with some other small eats, in a shady looking basement underneath some shops in a tiny strip mall. I recall saying, ""Bro, if I contract bird flu down here, I'm gonna kill you.""I remember sitting down in a rickety old chair amongst a group of people, and this woman comes up to us and asks what we're ordering. My friend says in Chinese, ""2 bowls of daoxiaomian please!"" At first, I was like.. daoxao? (knife-sliced) O_o Never heard of it.  Then I see this brolic Chinese guy with a round piece of dough in his hand and using a sharp blade, actually, for lack of a better word, slice thin strips of dough into the pot of boiling water. Hmm...Interesting. There's also another variation, where they knead, twist and pull the noodles..but I've never tried that; I've always had the knife-sliced noodles. A few mins later, 2 bowls of piping hot daoxiao noodles with slices of beef, were set in front of the 2 of us. I started eating..and holy sh!t.. It was love at first bite.. $5 for an amazing bowl of noodles and generous slices of tender beef.. Wow. I was so impressed with the food that I forgot how appalled I was at the appearance!

Awesome. If I was making this, I would be wearing the noodles. The guy behind the stall was definitely an artist in my book. The guy reminded me of the old school pizza guy who would toss and twirl the pie in the air when I was a kid.I saw this art of making fresh noodles on one of the cooking shows. The basic combination of flour and water with molding, stretching and pulling to make a delicious noodle may be a lost art one day. The precision and detail was definitely a big wow factor.On my first visit, my wife and I ordered two dishes which I thought was a soup base dish. Instead, we received two plates of noodles with veggies and pork. A small let down, but not the end of the world.The dish was delicious. Fresh noodles is awesome in any form. The texture, flavor and freshness sets it apart from process package product you buy at the supermarket. The dish was huge, enough for two people and we ordered two plates. We where stuffed. While I enjoyed the stretched noodles, the veggies and pork in the dish was on the small portion side. Oh well.On my next visit, I got it right. A delicious bowl of lamb noodle soup. Across the board a well balance dish with a flavorful broth, tender lamb and very tasty noodles. Add some heat and I was very happy camper.Overall, Lanzhou Handmade Noodle is a must try at The New World Mall Food Court. Get a table near by and enjoy the art form of stretched noodles being made.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,5379,4128 Main StGolden Shopping Mall,Flushing,11355.0,194119,"I haven't been to Flushing too many times in the past so my food culture/experience here was still rather...virginized (is that even a word?). I'm not saying I haven't dipped into different cultures and tried new things, but it's different when you come to a place where you're actually getting freshly prepared food, especially noodles. Before I continue with my review, I just want to mention how awesome the New World Mall is (I'll probably end up doing a separate review after this one). They literally have everything, but the food court is the best part and I've been told to visit it on numerous occasions from coworkers and friends, so I figured why not.When you ride the escalator to the bottom floor, it's hard to not get overwhelmed by the variety of restaurants to choose from. There's hotpot, noodle shops, cafes, places that specialize in drinks, stir fry stations, and even live seafood stations. I was pretty blown away by my choices, and it took quite a while to find the perfect place to eat. I came with a group of friends, so not everyone wanted the same thing, and we figured we'd all get something different so we can share among ourselves. Two of my friends and myself chose Lanzhou Handmade Noodle. Right away, you'll see one of the chefs preparing the noodles by stretching it and slicing the dough into boiling water for dishes. It's the first time I've seen that happen in front of me and it was a pretty awesome procedure to watch. We placed our orders, one of my friends getting the Roast Duck Ramen, the other ordering the Ox-Tail Cold Noodles (which inevitably was wrong and he ended up getting the beef stomach one instead, which was still equally as good), and myself choosing the Pork Cold Noodles. Our food was done in less than five minutes, cost under $10, and came out as huge portions, totally worth it. The taste of the cold noodle dishes (since I tried both) were similar, it was just the meat option that was different. The dish almost substituted itself as more of a salad than a noodle dish due to the cold aspect and refreshing sauces used and was almost as if the sauces were considered salad dressing to the noodles. Definitely a new experience for me, but a delicious one at that. Besides the noodles and pork, it also came with cilantro, tomatoes, bean sprouts, and zucchini as veggies complimenting everything else in the dish very well. The noodles were pristine and easily the best I've ever eaten. They had a chewiness to them, which I've never experienced with other noodles before, and I loved them for this reason honestly. You actually get to chew them and taste them instead of swallowing them whole and having them take on whatever broth/sauce you eat them with. It was incredibly enjoyable.Highly recommend this place if you're in the New World Mall, or just around the Flushing area.

We found the address easily enough and only after reading one of the Yelp reviews did we realize it was located in the basement through a separate entrance. We ventured down stairs into a maze of little stalls until we found Lan Zhou. I was happy to discover that their menu was in English, that they had an ""A"" rating from the board of health and the person taking the orders also spoke pretty good English. My wife ordered duck with noodles soup and I had the beef. We were told to take a stool at a long low stainless steel counter and a few minutes later our bowls of soup arrived.Big steaming hot bowls of noodles in a delicious broth chock full of beef, bok choy, cilantro and of course those perfect handmade noodles. My wife told me her duck was perfect. I can't wait to go back to try some of the other things on the menu. I noticed that they also have a sushi bar and the sushi chef was also having a bowl of noodles for his lunch.So if you find yourself on Main Street in Flushing's Chinatown go check out Lan Zhou for a tasty bowl of noodle soup.",5.0 star rating,"REGO PARK, NY",2,0,0.5,5.0,"wife,noodle soup,reviews,cigarette butt,soup,place,place,one,reviews,Chinese,Manhattan,Cottage.,Yelp,try,Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,address,menu,noodles soup,sushi chef,reviews,bowls,orders,some,stool,duck,beef,Lan Zhou,entrance,basement,stairs,stalls,maze,health,board,rating,person,duck,counter,menu,English,noodles,things,sushi bar,noodle soup,bowl,bowl,noodles,noodles,soup,bowls,beef,course,cilantro,bok choy,broth,lunch.So,Main Street,Chinatown,Flushing,Big","1,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,5,2,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,2,2,1","0.222649976611,0.0816588774323,0.0753468871117,0.0699567049742,0.0638159736991,0.0510331057012,0.0510331057012,0.0395608060062,0.0292613580823,0.0266756154597,0.0266756154597,0.0266756154597,0.0185298006982,0.0122704776004,0.0102359652519,0.00822060182691,0.00750961853191,0.00721152825281,0.00717999134213,0.0069758570753,0.00677601387724,0.00648914091289,0.00619278475642,0.00583416922018,0.00574070960283,0.00574070960283,0.00567764509469,0.00555299920961,0.00555299920961,0.00552456453443,0.00552456453443,0.00552456453443,0.0055044782348,0.0055044782348,0.0055044782348,0.0055044782348,0.00510063534603,0.00501176714897,0.004264626652,0.00420188996941,0.00389837217517,0.00373144843616,0.0037258840166,0.0037053541746,0.0034893436823,0.0034893436823,0.00248297792859,0.00248297792859,0.00235997419804,0.00222232658416,0.00187791476492,0.00164293812122,0.00164293812122,0.00164293812122,0.00164293812122,0.00152728904504,0.00152728904504,0.00152728904504,0.00152728904504,0.000647999520879"

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,5379,4128 Main StGolden Shopping Mall,Flushing,11355.0,2524,"I was over in Flushing today and decided to head on over to the Golden Mall after hearing about all the delicious food down there.  Arriving into the food court was like arriving in Asian Food Heaven.  There were so many good choices and I'm sure anything I had would have been tasty and delicious. I made my rounds looking at everything first because I just like to enjoy myself like that.  I finally came to the decision on trying Lanzhou Handmade noodles in my first excursion to the Golden Mall.  2 Main reasons...1- They were making fresh noodles and displaying the process. ( I am a huge sucker when restaurants do table side showmanship of their crafts. I.E. Mandoo Bar! ) 2-The line was ridiculously long and more people kept piling up. I mean people were ordering hot soups in the middle of the summer! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? It must be that good. Those two reasons are enough for me to get some and I was hungry!ATMOSPHERE: Being a food court style place it was very casual yet nice and clean. The little store had a nice homie vibe to it. It really reminded you of a little mom and pop store in Asia yelling out into the street to get buyers to come.  They worked fast showing that they had their stuff down as well as everything being made on the spot to keep up with the massive orders. Fresh is always better!FOOD:What else is there to say? Home made soup noodles made on the spot and on display? Is there anything more fresher, tastier and delicious than that? The veggies/meat are all tasty and presented to you right as they finished cooking so you are getting a hot meal fresh from the fryer figuratively speaking.  And the best part is that it is cheap!!! I can not believe they charge that little, but with that much popularity and customers its no wonder! It ranges from 5-9 dollars. What a buy! A lot of the noodles are 5-7 dollars only.  I went with the classic beef noodle soup and it was pretty good. Not many stack up to this. If you are my Texas people, it's just as good as King's Noodles + some.  DELICIOUS! You people have to try this place.  Just imagine having this in the winter time.........Line must be up the escalator and out the building!SERVICE:People literally are non-stop lining up for this one. You know its good when the line is long and people still line up. The service is fast though in my opinion. They get that stuff out quick! They have their stuff down and they have fast AND good service/food preparation. They worked like a fine tuned engine firing on all cylinders. You may think it takes a while to get your food but they pump it out. SUMMARY:Overall I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.  It was great and I definitely will go back and have more! The food is authentic, tasty, hot, fresh and delicious.  They live up to their reputation and you will not be disappointed.

The lamb was soft and moist. The soup was great. And their hand pulled noodles were great. You actually get to see someone behind the counter pull the noodles on the spot. This spot also has very limited number of seats so you have to wait for people to leave before you can sit down and have the noodles fresh on the spot. Definitely recommend that.

For me, these hidden gems are the best places to grab a cheap eat and also the best places to meet some interesting peopleOne time I was here, this old lady complained she didn't get her food yet (rather loudly too) only to realize she hadn't ordered yet. She then sits down in the vacant seat next to me and asked what I ordered. When I told her I got the lamb noodle soup, she informed me in disgust that she hated lamb (awesome..). 15 min later, when she was halfway through her noodle bowl, she offered me the rest of her bowl because she couldn't finish.

To be honest, this is the first time I've ever heard their name. But I know their taste anywhere. The noodles are chewy, but not rubbery and their broth has a strong kick to it. The meats are soft and complimented well with the crunchy bok choy floating around in the soup. Throw in some siriachi hot sauce and your good.Many people say this is the most authentic tasting noodles you can get in the states, but I've never been to china, so I can't tell just yet(hence the 4 stars), though I would be quite pleased if this were the case.

Beef and a lamb noodle.  The lamb noodle looked questionable.  I never seen lamb that looked like that. It looked more like chunks of pig feet. It was mostly bone and fatty skin.   About halfway through, I noticed one of the pieces of fatty skin still had a bunch of hair on it. I'm pretty sure it was pig feet that needed to have the hair removed.  The beef noodle was okay, but you can get a better experience in Manhattan.  The noodles themselves were good, but nothing worth leaving Manhattan for.

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,5379,4128 Main StGolden Shopping Mall,Flushing,11355.0,43150,"THE HOKAGE'S FAVIES: OX TAIL HAND PULLED NOODLE SOUP, MEAT SAUCE HAND PULLED NOODLE SOUP, WONTON HAND PULLED NOODLE SOUP. I have been obsessed with the flavors of this place since I was 13. It still delivers my dreams, over a decade later. This is my Ichiraku. I rarely give a place 5 stars. There was a dark time in my life where I lived in Brooklyn and I commuted 2 hours to eat here once a month. I moved to be closer to Lan Zhou. Yes, it's that good to me.For most of the noodle soups like wonton, dumpling, duck, and ox-tail noodle soups: The broth is light, but savory and deep, so you can customize it to your tastes--hot chili oil, Chinese vinegar, pickles. I like to eat my bowl half as is--and then add the chili in later, so I get to have both flavors. I also always bring a friend so they can experience the magic, but also so I can try their noodles too. That's 4 flavors dattebayo. I have eaten at hand pulled noodle places across Manhattan Chinatown and none of them compare. The broth is really where it's at, other places add too much soy sauce or too much salt; the base broth is just...in a different realm. The noodles also have more bounce to them here. Homeboy with the glasses always making them fresh in front of you. He's got the holy justu.The ox tail has the best purest broth, but it depends on the day sometimes, the meat itself is good too, but it's soup meat, so you know it's been sitting cooking and letting out its juices for your soup to be delicious. And I am grateful. The wonton one is good too. Thin wonton skin with shrimp, chives, pork inside. The dumpling has more skin on it, and tastes similar but is bigger, more pork flavored. The wonton wins it for me. The best one though--is when you go with a friend and take some of their dumplings from their noodle soup and put it in the meat sauce ramen. I've never ascended higher. I cannot live. If you don't have friends, it's time to reconnect bc this is worth it. The meat sauce ramen tastes like Americanized tacos. I mean that in the best way. It's so odd a parallel but so perfect in execution. If you like ground meat and spices, you'll like this. It's savory-spicy, not too spicy imo, but if you don't eat spicy food, don't get it. My friend Gaara only ever gets the duck or dumpling hand pulled noodles. Which is great bc we always swap.If you're eating here, it's really cheap. $6-7 a bowl, mostly. And it's filling. So you know, it's bare bones seating, just little stools and plastic everything. HOW TO CLEAN UP: empty the contents of your bowl into the bucket with the mesh so it drains the soup. Put the bowl in the bucket next to it. Throw out regular dry trash in the regular green trash box. Tip these guys for the amount that it's ""cheap"" to you. It's a place meant for the community, and people come to just grab their daily lunch or dinner after work here. They might not tip, but they also live here. Don't think that it's OK to treat this place as a cheap exotic stop-in. Don't be rude or loud with a big group. Tbh, I wouldn't come with a group larger than 4 if it's rush hour. I've been here when a group of white Americans asked for ice to put in their noodle soup bc it was too hot, and got angry when the chef said they didn't have ice. Which they don't bc this is more like a food stall. Unless you're gonna fairly tip the chefs who put up with you even asking that, take your jokes elsewhere. All the ""wait staff"" there are the amazing chefs too, don't forget that. I've seen a lot of disrespect here, and if you feel out of place there, be respectful and think about how this establishment was not made with you in mind. And how this place was made to serve its community bc society at large did not keep this community in mind. You are blessed to be able to taste the food here.

Ordered:#1 Beef and #13 Duck - I'm not sure if they use the same broth base for both but after comparing we thought there was a slight difference in the two (could've just been the protein that added diff flavors). Similar to Pho broth but those noodles.....so goood.  The beef slices are generous and the duck is as well but there was a lot of bone to pick thru on the duck FYI.We also got an order of dumplings from the place right across (12 for $4 are you kidding me??!!

Lan Zhou Handmade Noodle,5379,4128 Main StGolden Shopping Mall,Flushing,11355.0,107321,"I went here today because of a picture on facebook from a friends page. The bowl of noodles looked great! so I really wanted to try since I'm a noodle fan. I had a forewarning that this place was located in the basement .. but it was definitely far out from what I had imagine. lol Let's just say it had made me think of Asia..interestingly enough, I kind of enjoyed it since it was something new, hidden, and out of the ordinary. The basement was full of different food stalls, (very cramp, crowded, and humid-although I went on a rainy day) but the smells of the different foods did make you want to linger around. Lanzhou was the crowded one so my friend and I were like oh okay ..that is it .. the hand-pulled noodle stall. Luckily we had seats right away since a couple was getting ready to leave. Let me be honest, this place is def. not clean but what do you expect for a hefty bowl of noodles for 5 - 6 bucks only right? The people were very nice also and not hasty. foodI really didn't know what to order so I asked what was what but the workers weren't fluent with english so my friend had to be the interpreter for the both of us (everyone there seem to be speaking mandarin) and after all the confusing talks and awkward smiles.. I think she ended up giving me the number 2 which was the ox-haslet hand pulled noodle...lol I had no idea wtf ox-haslet was but whatever it is, it was pretty good. For some reason, I think individually the noodle, meat, broth is good on its own but when all mixed together it turned out to be just an okay bowl of noodles. Maybe I had a high expectation of it? but i was a little disappointed or maybe I just didn't order the fitted one for my taste. The meats were my favorite and they were the tastiest. Every piece was tender and flavorful. The broth could have been a little better, it needed a bit more of a kick. As for the noodles, I personally thought they were pretty good and chewy, but I wish they were a little thicker (but I saw someones review that they offer that now, just I didn't know how to order?)

One of the people here speaks English fairly well, but the rest don't. I recommend ordering a ""number one"" (the beef noodle soup), and maybe a water, and finding some place to sit.This is the best beef noodle soup I've ever eaten. The broth is rich, delicious, herbaceous. The noodles are delectable, and made right in front of you. The interesting thing is, many Chinese people eat only the noodles, and leave the left-over broth. You won't see me leaving any broth. I'm slurpin' out the side of that bowl.I generally help things along with a few too many dollops of chili oil, and if it's on the table, the vinegar they use makes everything so much better. I've also had their duck noodle soup; if you don't mind eating around the bones, it's pretty great. Their cattle tendon soup is also delicious, and as you eat the tendon you very much understand from whence the broth came. Their cold noodles are also great, but difficult to order given the language barrier.If you don't mind the slight grittiness -- better yet, if you enjoy the grittiness -- this is the place for you.

I wanted to try a new place so Lanzhou handmade noodle was it. I order the oxtail noodle soup which cost only $6. It only took a few minutes when my noodle came out. I added the chili oil and the marinated cabbage and some vinegar. Oh man did I love this noodle and it was even better then the other food stall that alot of chef made famous(Xian Famous Food). The broth was better and the oxtail just melt in my mouth. I was thinking about giving it 5 star but I am going go again and then if it taste exactly alike then I am going change my review to a $5 star.

I like the fact that they have food service-size 5 lb. packages of prechecked kosher salads, like Postiv romaine lettuce. Very convenient. Anything sold as prechecked from within the store itself I tend to avoid. They oddly enough have a very large selection of kosher grape juices, and they sell kosher wine within the store, which I'm not sure is legal in NYC or NYS.

Landhaus at Berg’n,5382,899 Bergen St,Brooklyn,11238.0,29930,"OK...let's be honest, people...Is there anything better than a) bacon or b) things on a stick?! Come on: popsicles, corn dogs, lollipops, cake pops, blue cheese stuffed olives, corn on the upright cob...I could go on (don't even play, you know you could too). Well, now you can have the best of both worlds in the blissful marriage of, you guessed it, bacon on a stick. And no, this isn't that ordinary bacon that's been packaged and shot up with salt, preservatives, pulled in and of the freezer section, no this is the real deal. Big green pastures real; pork belly from the far corners of Pennsylvania outer NY regions real; slow roasting until these slabs of bacon could honestly stand alone and sell out real.And it's not only in one place but several, gaining traction all throughout Brooklyn, thanks to the brilliant minds and seriously talented chefs behind the Landhaus team. This all too portable sinful meaty treat  is just the beginning though as Matthew Lief, owner and veritable mastermind, has taken Landhaus through to great success and ample praise at the Brooklyn Flea/Smorgasburg and has finally made moves to put some legs under this 'farm to sandwich' eatery--expanding to brick and mortar real-deal locations in Park Slope (People's Pops off-season stomping grounds) as well as moving into The Woods in South Williamsburg as a fully operational sandwich and small bites shop that unabashedly brings new flavor profiles and rich unctuous takes to comfort foods no one thought needed a boost at all. The BLT is out of this world and the clam chowder can bring you to tears--the best part though are the small seemingly siomple updates to what seems like the same ole sandwhich staples like chicken salad--Um ya, here that's jerk chicken to you with lip smacking chutney or the even more impressive kick-ass additions of sharp cheddar sauce and pickled peppers to the short rib sammie...Yep, I said it.Whatever you do though, do not, I repeat, DO NOT pass up their house-made fresh mint lemonade--not always available in all of their locals but when and if you see it. Nab one (or 5) for yourself--it'll not only quench your thirst, but prepare you to go right back in for another bite of--well--whatever meat-driven nibble in front of you, just daring you to dive right in.Do not miss visiting this location...it truly speaks to the determination and unabashed, unapologetic abilities of Leif and his partners--who have let the quality of their seasonal ingredients shine and their innovative menus and creative fare speak louder than words....or at least send fans to not be able to speak at all--because their mouths are full...with good, honest food (and or a little, or a lot, of bacon).

That is not the case with this review.  I used to take the train from Midtown to Brooklyn just to get some rice balls at Landi's.  They were so good!  Now that Landi's takes orders online and ships them in the US, I decided to order some rice balls last Thursday.  The owners are very honest and upfront.  I really miss that.  When ordering from them, I selected two day delivery, thinking I would get them on Saturday. I then called Landi's and confirmed the order placed online and asked when I should expect them.  They told me next week.  I asked them why and they told me if they shipped it Friday, it would sit in storage at a UPS place until Monday, since UPS doesn't run on the weekend.  Because of that, they ship orders Monday through Wednesday.  I am glad they were honest and conscientiousness about it.  Now that it was cleared up, I was planning to receive them Wednesday. Wednesday comes and  I tried to find a way to track the shipment, but no luck.   I called Landi's and asked about the status of the shipment.  The guy on the phone told me everything is being shipped within the hour.  I was shocked because I thought it was shipped Monday.  I told him I wasn't going to be around Friday when the shipment would arrive.  I asked him if he could FedEx them overnight and charge my credit card so I receive them before leaving town.  The guy told me he will overnight them to me and cover the cost himself!  I have not had that top of the line, professional, superior customer service in a long time!  I was so shocked and stoked!  Thank you Landi's!!!",5.0 star rating,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,1,0.0,6.09999990463,"review,star reviews,review,something,lot,insider,people,orders,case,guy,conscientiousness,rice balls,train,rice balls,way,town,order,Landi,orders,place,storage,owners,Midtown,Brooklyn,US,shipment,UPS,delivery,credit card,line,customer service,top,FedEx,shipment,shipment,guy,luck,status,everything,phone,cost","5,5,5,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,2,2,2,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7","0.244900986552,0.0758354142308,0.0758354142308,0.0688024014235,0.0563538447022,0.0563538447022,0.0563538447022,0.0378432422876,0.0334117487073,0.0176642183214,0.0158664379269,0.0151231968775,0.0119628980756,0.011668686755,0.00981906056404,0.00918345060199,0.00904734432697,0.00874226726592,0.00784259382635,0.00682842219248,0.00682842219248,0.00645877979696,0.00608875602484,0.00608875602484,0.00604948215187,0.0058266366832,0.00521214446053,0.00499485386536,0.00457570748404,0.00320474547334,0.00320474547334,0.00320474547334,0.0027435477823,0.00256393104792,0.00256183370948,0.00232822750695,0.00204011308961,0.00203844392672,0.00203687720932,0.00203687720932,0.00198054872453"

One of my stops is Landi's. Since my first review of Landi's 2 years ago I'm still thrilled with the store. Yeah, I love the Italian specialties, cheeses, prepared dishes and all that charming stuff but my review is primarily for the MEAT. The butcher counter service is great.

Lane Pizzeria,5385,7519 Jamaica Ave,Woodhaven,11421.0,102912,"Number of times I've been here: Countless of times since I was a kid.My family has been ordering from Lane Pizzeria since I was a kid, living only a few blocks away. I haven't really eaten a ton of pizza around the city, but Lane is good enough for me to come back regularly. The most common topping we order is sausage, and it's my favorite from them. For $16 for a large pie with a topping, it's an okay price, especially feeling satisfied every time. Their eggplant topping is also another favorite of mine, being breaded and a little crunchy. I don't prefer their mushroom topping as they're a little too big and moist, as if raw or having come out of a can. The ""house special"" topping that costs about $22 with everything on it is a feast to experience. I have a big stomach (and I enjoy good food), and I get full with 2 or 3 of these special slices. Having all the toppings allows me to observe that their vegetables are fresh and their toppings are quality. Occasionally, their pizza would arrive a little under cooked, soft, and soggy, instead of being crunchy. It wouldn't stop us from eating however.Their garlic knots suck though, being over-sized, tough, dry, and bland. I love my garlic knots oily and moist, very garlicky, and recently, crunchy! The ones from Lane are the exact opposite. My most recent order of garlic knots from them tasted rancid as if they were old, and I've avoided them since then. Because this was the first really negative experience I've had with them, my overall judgment of this place didn't change much. I know they do better, and I experience it consistently. Their garlic bread is a better alternative, and their pepperoni bites are my favorite side order. I love a pizzeria with great garlic knots though.I haven't really had a lot of experience with the rest of their menu, but from what I've had, I remember nothing amazing. In other words, their pasta, burgers, and mozzarella sticks are forgettable. I do remember them having some good chicken tenders that come with marinara sauce.Whenever I order in-store, I'm usually greeted warmly. The guys here seem to be friendly. I wouldn't eat in sometimes because it is near a school with some loud kids, the loud elevated J train, and because I live close by and could eat at home. It doesn't look like the cleanest place in the world and I'm sometimes wary of the food that's on display. Ordering over the phone is sometimes a different story. The same (elderly?) man who has been taking my order for years answers, and sometimes you can tell that he's in a bad mood. Sometimes it's a turn-off. Sometimes I'm scared to order. Sometimes it pisses me off. Usually when I tell him I want the free drink to be a Diet Coke for my diabetic father, the same Sprite arrives instead... every time. Despite my experiences ordering over the phone, their pizza leaves me and my family satisfied every evening we order from them.Lane Pizzeria's pizzas are good. One time, we ordered from them three times in one week when we were feeling too lazy to cook at home. We find them to be a reliable source for dinner.

I wouldn't have given it four stars. If only I could give it 3 and a half because that would be more accurate.

A nice assortment of green and red peppers, cucumber, onion and some string beans. The peppers added a nice spicy kick and it was interesting to see some stir fried cucumber in this simple dish. The spare ribs were nice size pieces of thin sliced pork chop pieces. Actually there was very little if zero bone to be found. The jing du style is the red style sauce that covers the pork with a hint of vinegar. I really like jellyfish so I will definitely will coming back to this place or some place close by.

Came here for dinner with the family (not my choice). Place reeks of cigarette smoke.

I could not stand this place, the noise level was overwhelming and even with No Smoking signs all over, the owners and the customers didn't care a single bit.

This place offers you a deal, but don't you go if you're starving and expect a lot out of this deal. The food itself was alright. Again, nothing special about this place.I also ordered a thai iced coffee. Why I am specifically mentioning this? Because it was served in a comically large glass. Like for a root beer float. Not sure why, but it was really weird. All I wanted was a simple thai coffee and I got that but in an insanely large glass.

My friends order a Massaman Curry ($10) and a Garlic - Vegetables ($10). They were very satisfied with their food. I on the other had had water downed curry. The waitress came back and asked me if it was spicy enough and I looked at her and said no. I found out later that they put cut up bird chili in the curry to make it spicy...

For appetizers we got fried calamari and friend tofu. The calamari was light and crispy. Must try. The tofu was bland. It wasn't crispy. For tofu I didn't expect much. It's probably all about the sauce. This time around I ordered the Green Curry (recommendation from a friend). The green curry was delicious af! The curry is semi-sweet and savory. It is spicy but not so spicy that you'll have a runny nose. The green curry comes with a side of rice. But I had to order two because there was just so much curry left. (Currently craving it.)For drinks I ordered a watermelon martini. I associate watermelon with refreshing so I was really looking forward to it. When it came it was far from it. I did not taste watermelon at all. It tasted disgusting like the cherry cough syrup your mom made you down as a kid. The waiter came to check on us and asked us if we liked the food and drinks. I hated my drink but didn't want to trouble them to change it. If I order it and don't like it, it's not their fault. Just won't order it next time. But my friend convinced me to ask them to change it. They changed it no problem and took the drink away. I asked for a safe bet mojito. Can't get that wrong. It was really good. It was strong but not overpowering. However, both drinks showed up on the bill. So that's really annoying. I didn't notice until later. I give it three stars based on this experience.

Lantern,5389,101 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,90541,"And for my 400th review, Lantern Thai Kitchen in Brooklyn Heights....Actually we enjoyed Lantern so much we dined there two nights in a row! I usually don't do this, but on the second night we were hot and tired and found ourselves looking for somewhere to eat right in front of Lantern. I just chose it again as it was an easy selection to make our party of five happy. Also our feet were killing us.First, Lantern is a really pretty Thai restaurant. There are some beautiful woodcarvings, even on the doors of the restrooms, and hanging lanterns. The ceiling has cool exposed beams and there are also exposed brick walls. I really liked the interior, it was causal but elegant. Service was also very good both nights we were there. Lantern has a bar with decent selection of Asian and local beers.Over the two nights we dined at Lantern we had a small variety of dishes. The fried calamari appetizer was very good, and cooked perfectly.  The Tamarind Whole Fish was a crispy whole red snapper with spicy tamarind sauce. The sauce was fantastic without bringing too much heat. The Pad Thai was also quite good and served in a unique way. Instead of the egg being cooked in the stir-fry, the egg was served as a thin crepe and then mixed in with the peanuts and lime. The Massaman curry, one of my favorite dishes, was also excellent. Everything we had at Lantern was good to very good to excellent.For dessert we ordered fried bananas with vanilla ice cream and Green Tea cheesecake. Both of these desserts were also great and not overly sweet. The prices were very reasonable, our bill for 4 people was just over $100.00 with two beers and 2 desserts and we had a lot of food. Lantern Thai Kitchen is in a great area on Montague Street. The restaurant is only a few blocks from the Brooklyn Promenade, Brooklyn Bridge Park.

The shumai appetizer was bland and the consistency of it was all-around a mushed mess - no texture.

We only spoke to what looked like the hostess but I definitely wish a manager was present. Came in on a Friday night on a whim after watching the movie IT. Shouts out to Bill Skarsgard. LolThe restaurant was fairly full, but there were empty seats. We were sorta hungry and craved something in the neighborhood. We were seated and water was instantly brought out. We looked at the menu, had questions and was really excited about eating Thai food. Since my guy is allergic to all nuts, this would have been an interesting venture. The hostess kept looking at me cause I would look at him every time he passed by. We sat there making small talk about the menu and an upcoming trip. But,  in the back of my mind I'm asking where's our server. A strong 10 mins passed by and we were still sitting there. No server came to take our orders or field questions. However a couple who's of...might I add, ""Caucasian persuasion""... listen...They were white alright. And was seated right next to us. The same hostess came with a haste just as he did us, and poured their water. But what followed was extremely peculiar.Low and behold a server showed up! This was like seeing a damn unicorn! But no he didn't show up at our table. He showed up and the white couples table. After we done sat there waiting for someone to take our order! I did a double take at my guy and both got up like synchronized swimmers and walked out of that restaurant. I shall never returned to place where me or my money isn't respected. And for those who may say. Ooh you're pulling the race card or they simply just forgot.... Uh yeah, about the only few black folks that were in the restaurant from jump? Go eat a dumpling with that thought.

The pad thai was my favorite out of the dishes I've ordered (including pad kee mao and pad se ew) in previous visits. Most items on the menu are appropriately priced -- a chicken pad thai will run you $10, for example. Where this restaurant lags is the seating arrangement. About half of the available seats at Lantern are at the large, groan-inducing communal table in the middle of the restaurant. I have yet to meet anyone that actually enjoys being seated as close to complete strangers as they are to their own friends. Unless they're hot. The service has also been consistently south of mediocre; not awful, but a bit slow and definitely cold. For example, my latest visit was encouraged by an advertisement in Time Out NY that read ""15% off your order when you mention this ad on your next visit."" When I did just that, they would not honor the discount without me actually handing over the ad. For the average person, this situation would be FUBAR because the ad was not intended to be a coupon and yet the restaurant is treating it as one. Luckily, I tore out the ad before dinner and was able to call their bluff.

OMG to die for.  I would suggest not eating all the sauce and saving some for your rice (thats what I do and its worth it).  Main Course Wise, I either go for the Thai fried rice (with Shrimp/beef) or their Angel Hair Noodle... it just depends on what kind of starch I am in the mood for.  Drink wise their Mai Thai is very good but I like the Thai Mojito.  It comes witha Leeche nut in it which gives it its own unique flavor (and the nut is edible).  For desert I am all about the Banana Lampi... its sweet and the texture is a mixture of hard and soft which to me makes it more enjoyable and less overbearing.If you are someone who is a stickler for customer service... well this may not be the spot for you.  The servers move quick and they arent always the most polite BUT if you can look past that and see how much more this place has to offer... like food, the intimacy of the decor, its not crazy pricy, the fact that not to many ppl know about it and the fact that after the date you can take a walk to the pier and see the city lights...you should be fine and this is the place for you and i cant wait for you to go there and tell me what you think.Food that sets your mood.Michelle B",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,8.30000019073,"dinner,food,spot,gentlemen,sister,intimacy,posts,Leeche,nut,scenery,Shrimp Fritters,decor,stickler,Main Course Wise,FOOD,spot,servers,HANDS,Food,candle,CANDLE,mixture,feel,eyes,food,being,spot,nut,places,Mai Thai,Michelle B,Mango Sauce,rice,fried rice,Shrimp,sauce,mood,place,opinion,name,NONE,some,beef,Angel Hair Noodle,food,starch,kind,desert,fact,pricy,flavor,Song,Parkslope,Chelsea,OMG,Thai Mojito,walk,fact,spot,city lights,pier,ppl,customer service,texture,Banana Lampi","7,7,7,1,1,7,5,3,6,7,6,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,2,2,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,5,2,2,3,6,4,7,2,7,2,1,7,7,1","0.129218548536,0.0945383906364,0.0786891430616,0.0704829543829,0.0576960332692,0.0382173098624,0.0333201028407,0.030721379444,0.0271118842065,0.0246196165681,0.0221724174917,0.0186852365732,0.0170898567885,0.0164228696376,0.0164062734693,0.012666516006,0.0123366024345,0.0115763824433,0.011142638512,0.0106677198783,0.0102411871776,0.0102078830823,0.0097315851599,0.00933477375656,0.00902565941215,0.00868333783001,0.00849974900484,0.00797108374536,0.007897535339,0.00759713677689,0.00755001045763,0.00716700125486,0.0071409274824,0.0071302796714,0.0071302796714,0.00696225836873,0.00652512628585,0.00635933736339,0.00628537684679,0.00628537684679,0.00628537684679,0.00624805409461,0.00623873574659,0.00623873574659,0.00608172779903,0.0057091540657,0.0057091540657,0.00568837719038,0.00483984453604,0.00423442199826,0.0040442137979,0.00372137106024,0.00372137106024,0.00372137106024,0.00370552949607,0.00346221565269,0.00341341807507,0.00335089839064,0.00308246747591,0.00304528349079,0.00293161068112,0.00233329506591,0.00212830910459,0.00186193780974,0.00110307731666"

The thai mojito and lychee martini are divine and still the best i've had anywhere (props to the bartender)! For the apps get the mango salad (it comes with yummy grilled shrimp, mango, mint and lime cilantro dressing), fried calamari, spring rolls, and curry puffs. Also ok are the vegtable dumplings and the shrimp shumai. As for the entree, sometimes they have good specials (ive had some good fish and my husband had some good chicken) but from the everyday menu stick to the Wok items, I like shrimp or vegetable eggplant basil, garlic dish is also pretty good. I'd streer clear of taking anything with chicken as its usually not very good (dry and overcooked). Their montegue fried rice is deelish with beef but sometimes a little too greasy. Also my husband said their noodles are ok. So if you know what to get you'll enjoy your meal, it took my husband and I about 4 years of coming here to figure it out but we finally did.

But it was your regular thai restaurant menu with average prices. I was impressed with the beer prices for the imports, pretty cheap.Service: No greeting by a waiter, didn't ask if we wanted drinks. Eventually she showed up, didn't say hello, made some sort of noise and nodded at my friend to order. Was kind of rude. We ordered and she rushed away. During the service she also touched my fork, which is a no no and rushed plates off our table when we were barely done with them.Constant flow of water - which i hate, total waste of energy.Food: I had the masaman curry...more like the mas-o-bland curry. Portion was normal but clearly missing some spices. Tasted watery. Potatoes were also cooked too much to be in a curry. Bottom of the pot maybe?

Lantern,5389,101 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,20994,"I waggled between two and three stars for Lantern, because it's largely dependent on what you order.  Since no one has reviewed it and I had to add the business to Yelp, I'll go on the more optimistic side of the review.  However, understand this: your experience at Lantern will vary widely depending on what you order.  I haven't been here more than three times, so can't rank the menu fully enough. The good:  Curries and Soups sections of the menu.  Particularly, the panang curry is delicious.  The average: ""Hot from Asian's Wok"" section of the menu.  The ginger dish was good, but left me craving even more flavor.  Too many onions and not enough other base spices or aromatics with the ginger.  (I wanted galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime; any other additional flavoring.) The bad: some appetizers or specials can be marginal. We tried some mushrooms that sounded good from the menu, a special of lightly breaded and fried mushrooms with flavorful honey-chili dipping sauce.  The result was abysmal.  The mushrooms were indeed battered and fried, but this had been done with them totally raw so the result was a crispy batter into a cold raw mushroom.  There was no seasoning or salt in the batter.  The dipping sauce was good but too pre-processed and not fresh flavors.  The unknown: 95 percent of the menu.  I'm convinced there are good things in here but it's trial and error to find them.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,-0.10000000149,10.1999998093,"stars,menu,mushrooms,Lantern,business,no one,Yelp,trial,side,review,experience,panang curry,flavor,ginger dish,Curries,sections,flavoring,section,things,appetizers,ginger,Lantern,Soups,good,average,aromatics,base spices,onions,result,dipping sauce,mushroom,lemongrass,galangal,kaffir lime,specials,bad,batter,seasoning,batter,salt,menu,Hot from Asian's Wok,flavors,unknown,error,menu,result,mushrooms,dipping sauce,special","7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.106522269547,0.106018610299,0.0792991966009,0.0725483819842,0.0511468797922,0.031702324748,0.0303906798363,0.0227271858603,0.0196211002767,0.0196211002767,0.0195207986981,0.0182901509106,0.0163623113185,0.0155507428572,0.0149739077315,0.0149739077315,0.0149335321039,0.0149103002623,0.0145964939147,0.0145388301462,0.0136031210423,0.0132209230214,0.0131039125845,0.0131039125845,0.0130482288077,0.0130067924038,0.0130067924038,0.0130067924038,0.0120708709583,0.0120504843071,0.0119615737349,0.0118880448863,0.0118880448863,0.0118880448863,0.0118737099692,0.0118737099692,0.0107709374279,0.0105534363538,0.0101012950763,0.00883874483407,0.00877613108605,0.00772922486067,0.0076848603785,0.00611115200445,0.00610672682524,0.0055861058645,0.00530309090391,0.00526034412906,0.00444521941245,0.00388907222077"

I ordered a shrimp Pad Thai and the vegetable roll appetizers. My husband and friend's ordered onion noodle something and tofu appetizers and they liked everything except the tofu appetizer. lolBesides ""Sea"" and ""Beet"" I had never gone to any other restaurants for Thai food before.    I wasn't a big fan of Sea and I'm hopelessly devoted to Beet so this was a gamble for me.  Thankfully, the food was actually very good!!!  It arrived hot, well presented and fast!  We were all satisfied with our meal that evening and with the service.  The serving staff are very nice, attentive and funny.  We were treated very well. Since then I have ordered the shrimp Pad Thai several times for lunch and dinner delivery and so far it has always been delicious!   They're also very nice on the phone.  That might not matter to some people but often times when I call into nice or okay restaurants they shout and get frustrated or sound terribly disinterested in my order and existence.  That really bothers me since my patronage is what helps them grow; it feels like they just want my money and don't want to give quality service.I have become a loyal fan of Lantern.  They offer what matters most to me, quality food, a kind staff and consistency in both.

Having move to the Midwest I would visit the area every few weeks and get lunch delivered once a week.  I noticed a dip in quality but I wrote it off as busy lunch issues. I came back to Lantern on a business trip and came in at 6:30 for an early dinner.  Not busy so there wouldn't be the attention to detail issues. Being a one trick eater I ordered the thai dumplings and chili basil with chicken.  ""Extra extra spicy please.  I like my mouth to burn when I eat thai food"".   Ok the waitress said. The dumplings were on the table before I came back from warding my hands - note good hygiene - which I found odd.  They were bland beyond compare and the sauce was even worse.  I was still holding out hope for the entree but when it arrived I thought the kitchen was somehow connected to a thai restaurant in Springfield, MO. It was sweet.  No spice except a little black pepper.  No chilies of any kind.  It is called chili basil!I asked the waiter why it was sweet, not spicy.  She pointed to the spices on the side and said ""I brought you spice on the side"".   I said ""I asked for extra spicy"" and she said ""we make medium spicy"".  She then basically asked me to go somewhere else if I wanted spicier food.  The manager, who remembered me from hundreds of visits, asked if she could make it again as I requested.  Again it was not hot and had barely discernible chili flavor.  After dumping a ton of chilis in fish sauce and ground red pepper I came close to the flavor I remembered.  The manager said if you want it spicy you need to ask for fish sauce and chilis to be added.  Bottom line - if you want a cozy wood atmosphere with great lighting and a nice Pinot with mild thai food come on down.   If you want a little fire look elsewhere.  I know I will be.

When it comes to thai food I tend to get spring rolls and pineapple fried rice with cashews. It was pretty good. Not the best but everything was definitely fresh. They have great lunch specials. I did not order off of the lunch special but my meal was not too bad. Spring rolls were 5 and my rice meal was about 10. The lunch special however is 10 dollars for a good sized portion and a small apetizer. Their portions are amazing (especially considering the price).

Lantern,5389,101 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4975,"During jury duty, the judge gave us a little over an hour for lunch one day. Which is just enough time to get some lunch at Montague Street. Lantern advertised their $9 lunch special on a marker board just outside their restaurant. For $9, I was curious so I stepped in. It was too dark inside for the lunch rush. Did they forget to pay their electric bill? It is not necessary to make a restaurant so dark in the middle of the day. Are they hiding something in the dark?! I sat down anyways because I made it that far and I was running out of time. I ordered the Grilled Pork Chops lunch special.  I was presented with two pork chops laying on top of a bok choy and american broccoli medley vegetable mix and white rice. The pork chops were not dry, the vegetables were a perfect side and it's Asian, so you need some white rice to round off the meal. For $9 it was worth it. If I could give Lantern 3.5 stars, I would. The flavor was okay. Nothing out of the world. I wished there was more ""grilled"" taste but it was okay. For the price, I was happy. It was just not enough flavor, lighting (ambience) and service to push it to a 4 star. Please turn on the lights!

One being "" Thai Style Shu Mai"" (Chicken & Shrimp Dumplings) and If there is really one or two complaints about this restaurant is that -- I've tasted better at Japanese Restaurants and there is definitely something wrong with their portion sizes. I understand appetizers are suppose to be a sample small dish from a restaurant, but seriously 3 shumai's!? The other appetizer we got was ""Chicken & Shrimp Fritters with Honey Chili Sauce"" and oh great, another dish that only came with 3 fritters. Overall, the texture was crunchy and I did love it.Entrees, I got a ""Grilled Chicken Breast Marinated Chicken Breast Oven.Served with Garlic Mixed Vegetable"" and I loved the way the chicken was  cooked to perfection and the way I like it and It was nice, tender, soft and delicious. The vegetables, were perfectly cooked and season and pretty good ,although I feel the dishes could have been filled up more. The bf, go""Grilled Pork Chops,Marinated in Thai Herbs, & Served Sauteed Greens"" and The pork chops looked amazing, definitely different and  it was cooked to the perfect texture and very sweet and tender.

Lantern,5389,101 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,90656,"This is a good place to go to for lunch, since they have a $9 special, which includes an appetizer and an entree. There are four appetizers to choose from and a greater selection of entrees.That being said, I have had better Thai food. The chicken and shrimp fritters are flavorless and the meat inside is dry - it crumbles when you bite into it and you really need the sauce it comes with to vamp it up. The pad see ew is not spicy despite the chili next to its name. However, it tastes decent mild and if I pretend that it's not supposed to be spicy, then it's satisfying. I usually order my entree with chicken, but I decided to be adventurous and try the shrimp. I am really glad that I did. The shrimp really made the meal jump from two stars to three stars. Many Thai places overcook the chicken slices that go into these dishes so I was a little worried that it would be the same with the shrimp. These were fresh, cooked just right, and a decent size. They weren't jumbo, but they weren't tiny either.If you're in the area, and looking for a cheap lunch around $10, then give Lantern a try.

The curry has a wonderful flavor, slightly sweet, a hint of lime, and a little bit of heat. I say ""little"" because even when I asked the good people at Lantern to make my curry extremely spicy (complete with dramatic hand gestures, I'm sure) they fail to do so. Still, the dish is very much above average, and a little chili paste goes a long way. Lantern does their vegetables very well, which is key; perfectly crisp, not overcooked at all, really just wonderful. And did I mention the portion is massive? Always two meals. The virgin rolls ($7) are a great choice for an appetizer. They're stuffed with baby spinach, celery, alfalfa sprouts, tofu, and avocado, and served with a very tasty brown honey-citrus sauce. Delicious, but also very light. Goes well (what doesn't?) with a bottle of their Pinot Noir ($32). And the mango mojitos? Yes, I know they're $9 but they are fabulous.Also, Lanten has great deals for their lunch special. Just $8 for an entree and appetizer. Just don't get the hot and sour soup.

Lantern Hall,5390,52 Harrison Pl,East Williamsburg,11237.0,86132,"Lantern Hall has literally best burger I have ever had. Hands down. I came in for the $9 burger and beer special and was blown away at how incredible the burger was. They run the special Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and if you see it, don't miss it! The burger is super juicy and grill-charred on the outside with a soft bun and a drizzle of their house burger sauce--sort of a classy Big Mac sauce? Fantastic. Seriously. They usually seem to have three beer choices for this special too, and they're always great. Normally a little variety in the type of beer which is a nice touch for different tastes. You can add a side of tots for $2 if you're feeling a little hungrier.The rest of their menu looks fantastic and I keep meaning to come in for it, but it's a little pricier (pretty standard Brooklyn prices) and the beer and burger special is just too good. The decor is beautiful--exposed brick, wood, artfully done graffiti, clean bathrooms--and the bartender (owner perhaps?) is friendly and accommodating. You can sit at the bar and play Mario Kart (Super Nintendo!) which is a great touch. They were playing 90s hip hop last time I was in which was great. Good beer selection which changes on a pretty regular basis.Occasionally I glance in on my way home and it's pretty empty, which has to just be due to the fact that it's still so new. This place is right up the steps from the Morgan stop and I'm hoping that works in their favor that they stay steady.

Lantern Hall,5390,52 Harrison Pl,East Williamsburg,11237.0,618,"Entering an empty public space feels like a transgression. Here is a beer hall, designed for mass merriment, but devoid of people. The last customer files out just a few minutes after we arrive on a Saturday evening. I continue to be mystified by the traffic flow in Bushwick. A perfectly nice, new bar just above the Morgan L subway entrance is but the latest example. The previous night I went to Yours Sincerely, a draft cocktail place much further out than this place. It was packed. Perhaps because New York magazine hadn't written a blog post about the restaurant, the hordes didn't show up. Or perhaps things really get going later in the evening.Whatever the case, the beer selection in here is varied enough to find something interesting, if not revolutionary. The bar snacks are greasy and heavy in an appealing way. My friend ate some fried pickles while I worked my way through a set of tatter tots.

Lantern Hall,5390,52 Harrison Pl,East Williamsburg,11237.0,194300,"I moved to NY for grad school a while ago.  This is the first time I'm reviewing a bar because I had such a great impression.So I'm a bit over the whole bar / lounge thing in NY, because everyone does the same thing, and if you're not treated like crap by a bartender, you're not in a cool place.  I hate that.  It's stupid.  I didn't work hard in school and at my job, then go out to relax, have some fun, and spend my hard earned disposable income, so that the kid who drank too much and never read any books in his adolescent years could treat me with no respect (run on sentence but I don't care because I'm rambling in frustration at the NY bar scene).  I thought about venturing out to Brooklyn with a couple friends, and we checked out Lantern Hall.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS are important.  And this place made a great impression.  WHY?  Because it didn't have the stuck-up jerks who don't treat you like a peon when you're ordering a drink.  AND THEN THE MAGIC:  Nintendo!  SNES!  N64!  Are you kidding me?  I met one of the managers Jeff, and he was super chill.  When he saw that we were checking out the games, he encouraged us to play some Goldeneye.  Mad respect Jeff.  Sadly, I got owned just like I used to.  AHHH that feeling of hanging out with buds and getting trashed on.  So some facts:  prices are reasonable for bar food.  Even though I didn't try many of the finger foods, they looked pretty good.  Especially the tater tots with all the craziness on them.  Definitely going to have to try that the next time I'm back.  They said it can get pretty crowded during the weekends, but I totally get why.  They do ""cool"" in a genuine, fun, and nice way.  Not the stuffy cool in Meatpacking and LES.  Hope it stays like that.Only drawback is that it's in Brooklyn.  Wish a place like this would open somewhere in Manhattan.  Hmm now that I think about it, it's probably better to keep it there, away from the douchey crowds that eventually ruin a bartender's attitude.  Disclaimer:  I know not all manhattan bars have that stuffy feel, I just haven't found one that I felt comfortable in.  To each its own.",5.0 star rating,"Cerritos, CA",3,1,0.10000000149,14.8999996185,"bit,time,grad school,kid,NY,Jeff,impression.So,bar / lounge thing,thing,bar,everyone,crap,jerks,place,bartender,school,job,fun,disposable income,books,place,impression,crowds,IMPRESSIONS,respect,one,Brooklyn,respect,feeling,bar scene,frustration,sentence,friends,peon,drink,MAGIC,managers,buds,facts,place,games,way,cool,drawback,somewhere,Disclaimer,Nintendo,SNES,N64,AHHH,bartender,feel,Lantern Hall,many,attitude,Manhattan,manhattan bars,Meatpacking,LES,bar food,finger foods,craziness,tater tots,weekends,prices,Goldeneye","7,7,3,1,2,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,2,1,3,6,6,7,1,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,1","0.338100522757,0.102074719965,0.0511558204889,0.0499473027885,0.0295319780707,0.0280183777213,0.0268939491361,0.0244755204767,0.0244755204767,0.0239511150867,0.0214293990284,0.0214293990284,0.0138084441423,0.0103006893769,0.00937045738101,0.00926242116839,0.0081053301692,0.0081053301692,0.0081053301692,0.00741787068546,0.00719143496826,0.00683621689677,0.006457131356,0.00642758328468,0.00625543761998,0.00616898946464,0.00579427694902,0.00563655700535,0.0056286198087,0.00547341117635,0.00547341117635,0.00547341117635,0.00546078244224,0.0054255547002,0.0054255547002,0.00541900703683,0.00539775425568,0.00492484727874,0.00492164725438,0.00460110139102,0.0043481294997,0.00366679183207,0.0036649692338,0.00366321625188,0.00366152799688,0.0035579551477,0.00320860603824,0.00320506864227,0.00320181786083,0.00291584804654,0.00289631076157,0.00289506604895,0.00284834741615,0.00267669395544,0.00253392849118,0.00247758673504,0.0024382986594,0.00216960092075,0.00216960092075,0.00184345990419,0.00184231961612,0.00161080097314,0.00161080097314,0.0016090242425,0.00151364889462,0.0014183424646"

Walking in, you see long wooden benches and local art work hanging on the exposed brick. The shelves above the bar are filled with mini kegs, a cool touch and fitting for their concept. My boyfriend and I sat down in the back and then we ordered the chicken sandwich from a bartender named john. John was incredibly well informed about the beers but unfortunately I wasn't planning on drinking that day. The food took about 7 minutes to arrive which was acceptable as the place was half filled (this was a Thursday at 6pm). The fried chicken sandwich was amazing. Perfectly crisp on a potato roll. A bit expensive for a chicken sandwich ($9) but this is NYC. Also, the burger was the same price which is strange. We stayed for a while and it was a chill atmosphere.

Lantern Hall,5390,52 Harrison Pl,East Williamsburg,11237.0,574,"This review is based on the food-Knew Lantern Hall had TV's so went to watch NFL game late Sunday afternoon. Place was dead, no one else was inside when I arrived at 3:30. Place was freezing cold and very dark. That was ok though bc I went to have some drinks and food so despite it was super uninviting I pressed on. Food was just terrible: -Fried Calamari: Very Mushy, somehow was fried but just soggy and not at all crispy. LIght coating on it was falling off and just unappetizing. -Wings: Had a 50 cent wing special. Wings were smallest ones I've seen. Size is not a big deal but they were completely dried out. The ""Buffalo"" ones were not buffalo, it was some sort of cheap pepper hot sauce on it. Sauce wasn't even hot just this odd pepper like flavor. Wings seemed to be a combination of grilled (there was some sort of grill marks on them) then fried.  Maybe they were just frozen and came with faux grill marks on them who knows. They were AWFUL. No coating/ breading on it which normally I would have liked but they just sucked. They didn't come with any blue cheese or ranch so had to ask if I could be  brought some. Finally for 6 wings a tiny thing of some sort of salad dressing came out, I guess it was OK that it was so tiny since wings were micro. -Burger: Asked for medium rare, came out well done. Definitely a frozen patty. Meat was poor quality and had zero flavor. Only flavor was the runny special sauce they put on it that made the whole thing soggy. -Had to ask for water, couldn't get a refill. When I asked for salt and pepper they told me they didn't have any. Finally someone was nice enough to bring me a little thing of each once they ""found it.""Overall it was a really bad experience. I had been here once before and it was just OK. Based on this I will never go back. I'm surprised it got s uch good reviews thus far.

It's great also that you can order however many you want. Like order of 4? No problem. Order of 40? Sure. Burgers: BEST burger in Brooklyn. And if you don't agree then it's one of the best. This is what originally hooked us into coming a lot. Wing night was just a bonus. Also check out their chicken sandwich. They usually have a big water thing for you to just self serve, but if not the staff is always great and kind! Great selection of beer too. Highly recommend you check out all their local selections. Coffee: Seriously stop by in the morning for a latte. It's amazing. I've worked in the beverage and food industry for almost 10 years and a big chunk of that has been with coffee. I don't drink coffee a lot cause I'm picky. This is great coffee. Cheesy tots: just order them and share with friends. It's pretty delicious. Everything about lantern is just great.

Lantern Hall,5390,52 Harrison Pl,East Williamsburg,11237.0,194260,"After reading mostly great reviews, I was a bit disappointed with MY experience of Lantern Hall.  I was surprised at how much bigger the space was inside from the appearance on the outside, and was super excited to play Super NES once seated.  I approached the bar to place my order like fellow Yelpers suggested, but was a bit put off by the bartender who continued her rather lengthy conversation with another patron before acknowledging my friend and I - strike 1.  Once she finally came over to us, I was happy with her recommendations of beer to have with my meal and she even gave me a sample (the beer was delicious).  I ordered a cheeseburger (medium rare) with tots, my friend decided on a cheeseburger (well done) with sweet potato fries.  We found the Super Nintendo at a table and chose to sit there.When my friend plugged the system in, we noticed there were no game cartridges.  They keep them behind the bar (for obvious reasons) so I asked the bartender for the games.  She was a bit busy at the moment so I made sure to let her know to take her time.  By saying ""take your time"" I didn't think she would then start scrolling/typing/messaging/Facebooking on her cell phone prior to getting the games.  I asked a second time and a short while later she gave them to us.  Strike 2Once we were brought our food, we paused the game to dig in.  We were both pretty hungry and excited to try the ""Best burgers in Brooklyn"" only to be disappointed.  His burger was as rare as mine, but not wanting to bother he just ate it. The burgers are pretty small, not much bigger than a slider to be honest, and nothing to write home about.  They're barely seasoned or anything special.  The tater tots were most likely from a frozen bag and neither of us were fans of the sweet potato fries.  Because I had an appointment to get to my friend asked for another burger (well done) to go before we left. When the burger arrived he bit into it (mostly out of hunger) to find yet again another medium rare burger.  He sent this one back and got another - this time we were running late so we took it and left.  When he bit into this THIRD burger - YUP! - you guessed it, medium rare.  Strike 3.I can't say I'll be returning, especially not with this particular friend, mostly out of embarrassment.  After reading such stellar reviews, I really hyped this place up, to be reaaaaallly let down.  Whichever Yelper it was that dubbed this to be the ""Best Burger in Brooklyn"" should really get out more, I promise you it is not.",2.0 star rating,"West Babylon, NY",3,0,0.0,9.19999980927,"friend,bartender,reviews,bartender,bit,experience,burgers,bit,Lantern Hall,bar,space,outside,appearance,order,Yelpers,beer,I - strike,burger,burger,beer,cheeseburger,tots,sweet potato fries,time,conversation,patron,sample,meal,recommendations,games,games,game,food,cheeseburger,bar,Super Nintendo,burger,system,table,reasons,cell phone,messaging,Facebooking,time,Strike 2Once,mine,slider,Strike,friend,reviews,hunger,burger - YUP,Brooklyn,Best Burger in Brooklyn,burger,sweet potato fries,embarrassment,place,neither,game cartridges,Yelper,nothing,home,anything,bag,appointment,tater tots","1,1,5,1,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,5,5,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,1,5,7,7,2,5,7,6,7,7,1,6,1,7,2,7,6,7,7","0.308330565691,0.0778000950813,0.0570596270263,0.0483473837376,0.0464228615165,0.0370412841439,0.035134036094,0.0235339514911,0.0220209453255,0.0216887518764,0.0211123954505,0.0176948010921,0.0176948010921,0.0176044870168,0.0119290659204,0.00915373396128,0.00845950376242,0.00800307746977,0.0078699272126,0.0076673720032,0.00764574389905,0.00764574389905,0.00713161565363,0.00705903954804,0.00673382496461,0.00673382496461,0.00670933909714,0.00670933909714,0.00670933909714,0.00608319789171,0.00606386596337,0.00553527381271,0.0054088733159,0.00516319088638,0.00514122843742,0.00509972171858,0.00498848594725,0.00450719380751,0.00450719380751,0.00449839839712,0.00448409607634,0.00448409607634,0.00448409607634,0.00410743430257,0.00409304024652,0.00408438406885,0.00408054981381,0.00380917266011,0.00331435259432,0.00325003196485,0.0030389635358,0.00303490716033,0.00276672514156,0.00249576685019,0.00219007208943,0.00210827612318,0.00209861760959,0.00209743482992,0.0019568533171,0.00195225968491,0.00141829636414,0.00133702193853,0.00133702193853,0.0013358524302,0.00133475940675,0.00133373343851,0.000660507881548"

My parents brought a haul of nearly half the menu from Lao Chengdu to my apartment for Chinese New Year lunch, takeout style. Here are the goods, ranked in order:(1) Diced chicken with peanuts and chilis(2) Water boiled fish(3) House fried rice(4) Husband wife beef tripe (I did not just make up this name - that's an exact translation)(5) Glass noodles in chili sauce(7) Crispy beef (8) Mapo tofu Everything was delicious but at the same time, everything tasted strangely uniform. The mapo tofu, husband wife beef tripe, and water boiled fish came with the same skin of red chili oil.

Lao Chengdu,5393,37-17 Prince StUnit A,Flushing,11354.0,8733,"We were very happy to find Lao Chengdu open on Saturday night after a long drive from PA.  It is not a big house, but plenty large for the three of us. Only one other table was occupied around 8:30, and we have plenty of kind attention from the server and manager on duty. The menu was bilingual with photos to make ordering pretty easy if you have any familiarity with Szechuan cuisine. We ordered four dishes: Fried Noodles in Soy, Sliced Beef in a soupy chili bowl, Chongqing Chicken (always a favorite), and Lamb & Scallion.  All were very good to excellent, although truth be told, none were as spicy as expected as the flavor of numbness never occurred.  Still, no complaints as our small crew had varying degrees of tolerance for Chendu heat. The chicken was the hottest with a load of red peppers and a few of the extra zesty star black peppers in attendance. Nice and crunchy, with peanuts galore.  Loved it.  The lamb was tender with only mild heat, but a nice contrast to the chicken. Very good. The sliced pork was likewise soft and moderately spicy, but not alarmingly so.  Liked it.  The noodles seemed handmade.  They were thick and chewy, and the simple soy based sauce, delicious. Gulped them down. We sat around picking directly from each platter/bowl with our chopsticks until around 10 pm, when it was time for us to move over to the hotel for the night.  Enjoyable repast and evening, with a solid dinner and service. Introduced my son to authentic Szechuan cooking, and he definitely had fun with it.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,2049,"Came here and ordered the spicy beef stew hand-drawn noodles, meat & bean source (according to receipt) hand-drawn noodles, and pork & leek fried dumplings.The pork and leek fried dumplings were very delicious. Tons of meat and leeks. I did think the dumpling skin was too thick and as a result, a little soggy, but the inside was very flavorful. It tastes even better when you add the hot chili oil in the big plastic container on the table. The beef noodle soup was not spicy at all. The broth was just alright but once you put a spoon full of the hot chili oil, the dish became complete in my opinion. Yes the broth is a little oily and the chili doesn't help but I don't think you're coming here for healthy food. Despite adding a real spoonful of chili, the dish wasn't spicy at all. It was just a little kick and that was it. I am extremely surprised that the chili was not that spicy at all. The watered down rooster sauce was a little spicier, but not by much. The noodles were really good. A little al dente and it was thick enough. I think if the noodles had been thinner, it wouldn't have been appropriate for this dish. They give you lots of meat/ingredients.The meat & bean sauce noodles was okay. It's not a soup based noodle. You just have to mix the bean sauce into the noodles really well. I was surprised that this dish was not spicy at all. Usually this dish is. Again, just add the chili oil to this and it'll taste 10x better. They also have potatoes in here which is a little different from what I'm used to but that's probably because the origin of this dish comes from a different part of China than what I've eaten before.Service is just okay. You have to ""fight"" for your own table. You place your order, pay for it, then hope that there's a table open for your correct party size. You basically share tables with other guests. Once you're done, you bus your own table with soup going into one trash can and the rest in another. It's exactly what it's like in China in certain noodle houses.

Now, about this place, it's very different from Take Out; it's actually much healthier. Their signature creation is their warm, juicy, and delicious dumplings; and if you're lucky, you might hear a crispy crunch to your dumpling, yeah, good fried stuff.The Hand drawn noodles is their secondary signature creation where they make the noodles and they display it through glass. The noodles are hearty, tasty, and slurpy =) quite nice.My personal favorite item on their menu is the scallion pancake; it's special from all the other pancakes because it has meat and honey in the pancake which makes it terrific. I completely recommend this place, it's not a good sit down place, so order it to go. Also there are no parking locations, so if you drive, drop off someone to get the food and then meet them in the corner, the street in front of this place is rather narrow and congested, so prepare.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,43273,"This place is a total gem in this area! Great food and great price,  I cannot ask for a better Chinese food quick fix restaurant.  The only downfall is that it's a cash only place,  it's not a huge deal,  Im always prepare with cash when I am in this area. Hehe.  So how it works here:1) choose item from menu2) pay by cash3) keep your receipt and listen out for your number 4) pick up food at the counter and pig out!! Anyways,  they are known for their dumplings which are ridiculously cheap! I preferred the steamed ones,  but there are fried dumplings as well.  The steamed ones take a little bit of time to make while the fried ones are served right away.  It was my friend's first time there and he wanted to tried the fried ones.  The reason why I don't really like the fried ones is because they have way too much dumpling skin,  it's too thick for me and not enough meat to make up for the difference.  The steamed ones are more light and airy and tastier in my opinion.  I also don't understand why they don't have normal soy sauce... But a vinegar liked soy sauce,  which I don't quite enjoy as much.  So on to the good part,  their hand pulled noodles.  If you haven't tried hand pulled noodles,  this restaurant is a good place to try!! My favorite is either the beef or the lamb hand pulled noodles,  which cost me $7. Not a bad price for a really hefty meal! Let me tell you,  they don't go stingy on the Portion at all! We ate around 7pm and I was beyond full even after 2am! The soup comes with beef,  obviously,  and some vegetables.  The broth is absolutely delicious and so freaking flavorful.  You can't help but slurp your entire bowl!

It was down to Prosperity and Vanessa's both on Eldridge St. Prosperity we thought had better and cheaper dumplings while Vanessa's had better sesame pancake sandwiches! But Now!!! The dumpling king in my book is Lao Bei Fang dumplings!!!!!! Oh Man were they tasty!!! The pork filling inside was so much tastier with huge pieces of chives and a thin and perfectly cooked skin, crispy on the bottom and thick enough not to fall apart but not overly doughy! The steamed dumplings are just as good too!You gotta dip then into soy sauce and their hot oil pepper flakes!! (they offer 4 or 5 different condiments! And they don't water them down like they do EVERYWHERE else!!!!) And I haven't even gotten to their HandMade noodles yet!!! Each batch is made to order! So you'll see a short show of stretching and twisting dough and it magically becoming thin noodles!! So with the handmade noodles there's a bunch of noodle soups to choose from, I tried the beef noodle stew while my girlfriend had the beef noodle soup. Both were pretty similar however the stew had huge pieces of meat as opposed to strips of beef in the soup. Portion sizes are huge!! It seemed as if the noodles were never ending!

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,123468,"You know what? i actually thought this place was going to be a total dump after reading a couple of reviews stating that it was dirty and cramped. Instead i was very much pleased as i received a graceful salutation as i entered the joint. I was served by a very pleasant woman who youthfully and graciously took my order. Yes the place is very cramped, but you can get around, its not mission impossible, the only thing i didn't like was that they have their sauces  out in the open, very accessible to anybody to play with, not very sanitary. To top things off there was a bum ( yes a real street peddler) eating a meat dumpling, and carrying on talking to himself saying that he was the character Frank from the movie Scarface. Mind you he had only one good tooth in his entire mouth, and he was laughing blissfully after every other word he spitted out. For that reason i don't give them the five stars.

I had just moved to Jackson Heights and decided to explore the surrounding neighborhood, and this place was packed so I figured I would see what was up. I got the wonton noodle soup, and it was fantastic. I've never had a better wonton noodle soup. They make their own noodles and you can tell that they're fresh, not out of a bag. The wontons were itty bitty, which was fine for me because they had put in plenty of veggies like bok choy and green onion, which for me is preferable to having a few huge wontons and no veggies.

A little dirty and lots of chinese going on. When you walk in. The overwhelming smell of noodle shop will hit you and opens up your appetite. A little dirty but what good & cheap asian spot doesn't have a little grit and dirt around? It's a walkup counter to order. CASH ONLY. Seat yourself. Enjoy a piping hot bowl of noodles. Big bowl of noodles for under 9 bucks. My go to is the Beef Stew & Tendon for only 7 bucks. I also usually get a cold appetizer as I wait. The dumplings are popular also and reasonably priced. All noodles are freshly made. You can watch on the side as they make it. I wish I didn't live so far from this place but it's a good bowl of noodles. Just look at the other reviews. Portions are large Noodles are fresh. Appetizers are good. Dumplings are good. Cheap. PRO TIP - eat it there! spend the 5 minutes and down your bowl there. It is that much better when you have it there because the noodles are fresh and soup is hot. PRO TIP #2 - Related to the tip above - 25 cents per take-out container. CASH ONLY. Eat it there.

Expect some complications when you order.#1 RULE when you come here,Just because your total adds up to less than what you expected, doesn't mean you didn't order enough food. I make this mistake all the time. I look at my receipt and think, no way can $8 dollars fill up me and my 200 pound meat eating boyfriend. Guess what? Oh yes it can. It probably has something to do with all the MSG.With that being said, don't save your unfinished food for the next day, its sort of like eating left over McDonalds.

You can get a big bowl of hand pulled noodles with a choice of toppings all at a whopping price of $6 or less depending on what you select.  How can you go wrong?   Once you decide what you want you get online and put your order in and pay (cash only). They give you a receipt with a number on it and you go and find a place to sit.  When the food is ready they call your number and bring it to your table.  Everything came out very fast, under 5 minutes.  I started with their pan fried dumplings.  They were really tasty little suckers (8 pieces for $2.75).  The skin was a little thick but to me they were packed tight with pork and chives.  I also ordered their hand pulled noodle soup with wontons and fish balls.  It came topped with some vegetables, bit of seaweed with scallions and cilantro.  I was a little disappointed that their wonton's really didn't have that much filling. The rest of the soup was good.  I would have to say if I had finished the whole bowl of noodle soup I would have gone into a carb coma.  Next time I'm going with the beef tendon noodle soup.  Just a quick FYI, if you can't finish your soup and want to bring the rest home they charge you $.25 for each take out container.  By far this is not a fancy place.  If it was a bar I would consider it a dive but I can only say that this place literally offers really a cheap eats.  I can absolutely can see this place really getting packed we just got lucky because of the terrible weather.  This place offers good food, plus they have a decent menu which will definitely have me coming back.",4.0 star rating,"Sunnyside, NY",3,0,0.0,13.3000001907,"sister,noodle soup,hand,place,table,place,paper menus,takeout,plan,bar,counter,number,place,noodle soup,buffet style,hand,people,tables,receipt,people,suckers,noodles,meats,soup stock,face,smell,space,chairs,menu,food,hand,place,place,place,food,numbers,menus,number,some,table,eats,noodle soup,beef tendon noodle soup,soup,skin,dumplings,Everything,glass,walls,pictures,price,choice,toppings,cash,order,bowl,pieces,pork,chives,Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,container,bowl,place,carb coma,FYI,food,rest home,dive,eats,noodle soup,soup,weather,rest,hand,wontons,wonton,fish balls,cilantro,scallions,seaweed,vegetables,bit,filling","1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,6,5,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.131472334266,0.0783439055085,0.0647219270468,0.0640931800008,0.0450410507619,0.0361071489751,0.0320784151554,0.0281553063542,0.0272082369775,0.0249322932214,0.0191793255508,0.0144935231656,0.0143622988835,0.0141779184341,0.0130245350301,0.0116848479956,0.0112671069801,0.0108179561794,0.0104352198541,0.00984046887606,0.00953433383256,0.00873875059187,0.00862517673522,0.00862517673522,0.00862517673522,0.00862517673522,0.00861060153693,0.00861060153693,0.00833931751549,0.00811589229852,0.00782210566103,0.00766251189634,0.00737347081304,0.00736724352464,0.00729432981461,0.00728459935635,0.00728459935635,0.00724727381021,0.00663478393108,0.00662674894556,0.00661793444306,0.00643133977428,0.00642814394087,0.00642507057637,0.00627970555797,0.00601849798113,0.00583191681653,0.00580507470295,0.00579732842743,0.00579732842743,0.005783948116,0.005783948116,0.005783948116,0.00577265955508,0.00577265955508,0.00560655025765,0.00526216533035,0.0052587450482,0.0052587450482,0.00510760676116,0.00455694971606,0.00447786925361,0.00427372241393,0.00391766894609,0.00391384819523,0.00339931738563,0.00336144072935,0.00311236060224,0.00309434067458,0.00282743643038,0.00282265269198,0.00270596356131,0.00234661996365,0.00197520921938,0.00196817005053,0.00189250032417,0.00172182999086,0.00172081426717,0.00172081426717,0.00172081426717,0.00172081426717,0.00172081426717,0.00171984429471"

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,11150,"To call Lao Bei Fang a casual eatery would be somewhat euphemistic; 'grimy' would probably be more accurate. With dim lighting and tables sticky from the meals of countless diners before you, the ambiance is obviously much less a priority than the food, which earned a solid 3.5 on my last visit. You order first at the counter, either from the few ready-to-go items that in pans, or from the more extensive menu. Much of the menu space is dedicated to dumplings and noodles, which is precisely why we chose to order one of each. I especially anticipated our stir-fried vegetable noodles after watching the designated noodle master in the back of the restaurant providing both dinner and a show as he tirelessly worked with a ball of dough which was pressed, tossed, spun, and whipped into fresh and chewy glutinous threads of hand spun irregularity - some as thin as angel hair pasta and others nearly as thick as udon. I found the non-uniformity endearing and a clear sign that these were made in house (yes! Down with homogeneity in the noodle universe!) though I recognize that not everyone might view it so favorably. Stir-fried with a generous medley of vegetables and covered in a sauce that was heavily redolent of sesame oil, I found this dish perfectly likable, though I was somewhat less pleased with how lukewarm it was. For a dish that had been made to order (and had required a surprisingly long ten- to fifteen-minute wait for a stir-fried dish, especially when others who ordered their noodles after us had already starting digging into their food), it was already on its way to becoming cold, which made me wonder if they'd forgotten to announce our number until long after it'd been done. We also ordered a plate of steamed vegetable dumplings (which took even a little longer than our noodles), and these were far less impressive. The dough was thick, the chopped vermicelli and cabbage filling proportionally small and lackluster, and it took some healthy douses of the supplied vinegar, hot chili oil, and soy sauce before we could begin to enjoy them. These were (also and unfortunately)  well on their way to tepidity by the time we got them to our table. Though this was far from a perfect meal in my book, two things were standout personal pluses. One, it is serve-yourself: you bus the trays of food from counter to table yourself and get your own hot tea from the provided dispenser. As such, there is NO tip. Second, there is a restroom available. Yes, it's just as dingy as the rest of the restaurant (if not more), but nothing's worse than slurping down a carafe of tea and realizing there's nowhere for it to go.",3.0 star rating,"The Woodlands, TX",3,1,0.0,7.0,"food,ambiance,eatery,number,dumplings,vegetable noodles,Lao Bei Fang,tables,meals,counter,lighting,diners,visit,items,dish,sauce,others,ball,noodles,restaurant,noodle master,Much,menu,one,pans,each,menu space,back,noodles,vegetables,dish,dough,some,others,dough,food,dish,sesame oil,dinner,way,show,udon,angel hair pasta,irregularity,hand,threads,house,sign,everyone,homogeneity,noodle universe,medley,things,plate,food,table,way,restroom,meal,counter,tea,tepidity,book,bus,trays,rest,restaurant,carafe,tip,nothing,tea,dispenser,nowhere,noodles,wait,vegetable dumplings,soy sauce,chili oil,douses,vermicelli,vinegar,cabbage","7,7,3,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,4,6,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7","0.141164913774,0.109494313598,0.0662399232388,0.0334928780794,0.0292911175638,0.0285627804697,0.0270518567413,0.0248291585594,0.0248291585594,0.0247025229037,0.0217371322215,0.0217371322215,0.0217371322215,0.0210353396833,0.0202339626849,0.0191496443003,0.0154721690342,0.012448662892,0.0124470330775,0.0111114541069,0.0100639937446,0.00959417782724,0.00945309828967,0.00941873434931,0.00827192980796,0.00824185088277,0.00824185088277,0.00821859482676,0.00761570688337,0.00693149492145,0.00693149492145,0.00642475299537,0.00634251628071,0.00634251628071,0.00634251628071,0.00633383961394,0.00633383961394,0.00630486151204,0.00629910593852,0.00576115911826,0.0055494797416,0.0055494797416,0.0055494797416,0.0055494797416,0.0055494797416,0.0055494797416,0.00553667359054,0.00553667359054,0.00552586931735,0.00552586931735,0.00552586931735,0.00551652675495,0.00549424858764,0.00471325404942,0.00470609264448,0.00428880238906,0.00428880238906,0.00428846431896,0.00428445311263,0.00428043026477,0.00381891871803,0.00375231239013,0.00374850677326,0.00374498683959,0.00374498683959,0.00349849159829,0.00349849159829,0.00329095358029,0.00321364821866,0.00301145669073,0.00295629911125,0.00259276200086,0.00258638616651,0.00249307765625,0.00247837370262,0.00188538827933,0.00188311061356,0.00188311061356,0.00182336417492,0.00175528845284,0.00164742756169,0.00164742756169"

I had placed my order over the phone and told them that I'd be there in 1/2 and hour to pick up my order. When I got there, the girl behind the counter just finished cutting my scallion pancakes and shoved them into a plastic bag, which is stupid given that fried food needs to breathe in order to stay crispy.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,6647,"I was at Taco Bell the last time I recall being able to feed a group of four with just $10. It was also during the early 90's. What a great meal that was. ""Yo quiero Taco Bell"" didn't become a catchphrase for no reason. Yo quiero Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House tambien! It's just as cheap and satisfying but better! The food is made fresh, there are no preservatives, and definitely no mystery meat. Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House is still fast food but tastes homemade. It's food for your soul and not your gut. Thighs for some people. Let's be real. A trip to Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House is all about carbs and will result in heftiness.I had the Beef Stew Noodle Soup and it was delicious. I have only had Chinese beef stew soup once before from Kar Won in the Upper East Side. Lao Bei Fang's is milder and friendlier to the non adventurous and scared eater. It's not very spicy and the beef cut used wasn't so heavy on the muscle and tendons. The noodles were soft and very fresh tasting. Get a load of the man hand pulling the noodles. It's a sight to be seen and one to admire. The soup turns out only as great as his skill. There are no shortcuts taken and he is a pro.I found nothing spectacular about the dumplings. The fried dumplings are better than the steamed ones. The steamed ones are fatter and taste watered down. Consuming the dumplings are an easy way to feel full fast. I'd recommend going for the soup over the dumplings. It's unfortunate Lao Bei Fang is a dumpling house and not a soup house. The strength is in the latter.A nice addition to any dish is the Scallion Pancake with Beef. This was new to me and I immediately took a liking to the filled pancake. I would describe it as a light flat sandwich, crispy, and oniony.   The next time I find myself with a few bucks in my pocket, cold, and craving comfort food, I'll be sure to park myself at Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House.

The fragrant aroma of basil and parsley merged with the scent of tender beef as I looked at the steam rising from the bowl gave so much comfort on this cold and rainy day. The hand-pulled noodles were al dente, sort of giving a little tug as you bite into it, which is a texture I appreciated.  Predictably, I was not able to finish it and had to ask for a container. At $5.50 ($0.25 for the container), it was a great and filling meal, perfect for the cold weather.  And I will certainly try to remember bringing my own container next time. ~_-",3.0 star rating,"Astoria, NY",1,0,0.40000000596,6.09999990463,"weather,nothing,one,soup,raindrops,mood,bowl,container,noodle soup,weather,opportunity,beef combination noodle,noodles,one,tender beef,infant,basil,parsley,scent,steam,comfort,Lao Bei Fang,aroma,bath,Roger F.,weather,meal,container,texture,tug","7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7","0.118447497487,0.115581184626,0.10817027837,0.10817027837,0.095123693347,0.095123693347,0.0620724260807,0.0340972319245,0.0335075035691,0.0222758110613,0.0177534781396,0.0149966552854,0.0148296197876,0.0135964658111,0.0135582229123,0.0123615060002,0.0118684079498,0.0118684079498,0.0118684079498,0.0108639122918,0.0108639122918,0.0105348238721,0.00921771675348,0.00846067629755,0.00708174146712,0.00702742021531,0.00667868880555,0.00602817256004,0.00441369181499,0.00355846504681"

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,2104,"Lao Bei Fang (老北方) is somewhat of a conundrum in a Chinese sense because it's neither really Bei Fang (Northern) or Lao (Old). However, it is popular and one of the more dependable noodle / dumpling spots in Elmhurst, a hood where specialty Chinese spots don't typically thrive in more than say a Flushing or Brooklyn Chinatown. Their new digs have brought a friendlier crowd in the door and they're still hand pulling the noodles in person for the camera toting Instafood-fans.The charming, yet divey digs that Lao Bei Fang was known for are now a thing of the past. The new interior as of the last year is way more modern and inviting, with ample seating and a more modern setup with open displays to the kitchen (important for the hand pulling) and no shortage of Chinese decorations as if it were the Lunar New Year every day. Hell, a lot of their menu and signage is in English now. #wemadeitFor a long time it was a limited number of noodle soups, but they've since expanded to a variety of meats / veggie noodle soup combos and the prices have naturally inflated as well. Among their better selections is the classic Beef Stew Noodle Soup (牛腩手拉麵 - $7), where the brisket is fatty and tender and the noodles are naturally al dente. Soup broth could always use an additional kick, which is why hot oil (辣椒油) is sometimes a necessity. I reserve similar kudos for their Lamb Noodle (羊肉麵 - $7) version, but it's hard to trump their beef staple.The dumplings are naturally steamed (水餃) or fried (鍋貼) and somewhat doughy for my tastes, but they work well in a pinch. For the sauteed noodle options, they also work as a quality side and occasionally have a juicy bite to them. I would avoid the pork and vegetable buns (豬肉包／菜包) all together.Like all inexpensive and wonderful things in life, it's strictly cash only here. The service has gotten better over the years and they've graduated from flimsy plasticware and notebook bookkeeping to actual hard plasticware and electronic cashier machines. Even their delivery has become a force to be reckoned with.

To discourage people from drinking too much tea?) to wash down that 'ma la' taste from your taste buds.  Even when you ordered 'little spicy', you will still be hit by the capsaicin effect.  Due to some misunderstanding of the menu, we ordered the vegetable soup off the 'hot and spicy' section, which does not come with the famous noodle, but rather just mung bean threads. Disappointed that we did not get to try the doughy goodness, I voiced my lament to the young lady working at the cashier and asked (or begged) if the chef could just give me ONE strand to try.  She went to the noodle chef and he said if someone order a bowl, then he would give me a taste.  Elated, I prayed a customer would come in the door at this very minute and order a bowl.  Fifteen minutes passed and still nobody placed a noodle order. (Why did that high school kid order rice here???), but finally, I saw piping hot bowls delivered out of the kitchen.  Still, no sample. I started to be greatly disappointed by this false promise.  Really, do not make a promise if you cannot keep and then like a beacon of steamy air, the kind young lady brought to our table a small saucer filled with the famous noodle in beef broth.  She remembered! The chef remembered! I was so touched and thanked them continuously.  Look, it is NOT about the food anymore, but the wonderful food service the staff provided for us.  That is one of the reasons why I wrote this review because LBF deserves to be complimented for their attentive customer service at a no-tips setting.  Granted you have to clean after yourself, but that just makes the experience that much more homey, like eating at a friend's house.  We also ordered a side of fried dumplings.  Not the best because the skin was thick, but you do get your to satisfy your hunger at a cheap price.  Besides the noodles, there are another ethnic breakfast items, like congee, steamed buns, soups, and a selection of cold appetizers.  So, grab a bowl of noodle soup and bring home some appetizers for your next meal.",4.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",3,0,0.0,11.1000003815,"noodle bowls,house,price,noodle chef,piece,expert noodle showman,front,dough,noodle,bowl,Manhattan,Lao Bei Fang,setting,breakfast,eaters,locals,lady,section,LBF,orders,nonstop,chef,atmosphere,bathroom,reasons,table,tea,tea,noodle,goodness,families,teens,bowl,dinner,lunch,restaurant,lot,people,cups,customer,bowl,bowls,experience,taste,vegetable soup,noodle order,promise,ma la,taste buds,capsaicin effect,misunderstanding,mung bean threads,menu,cashier,lament,someone,one,door,high school kid order rice,kitchen,sample,taste,noodles,food service,setting,customer service,house,nobody,strand,bowl,staff,review,friend,side,soups,noodle soup,lady,skin,price,cold appetizers,noodle,dumplings,best,hunger,congee,selection,buns,meal,appetizers,breakfast items,saucer,chef,table,food,beef broth,air,beacon,promise","7,2,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,6,2,1,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,6,4,7,2,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,1,7,6,1,5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0617618709803,0.0468914434314,0.0468914434314,0.0416997894645,0.0410855598748,0.0410855598748,0.0410855598748,0.0410855598748,0.0332487784326,0.0295873042196,0.0244226306677,0.0244226306677,0.0224157683551,0.0224157683551,0.0206400938332,0.0196240525693,0.0186800844967,0.0170161835849,0.0162771511823,0.0109757650644,0.010300074704,0.0102700199932,0.00914419256151,0.00869271624833,0.00857896637172,0.00857766997069,0.00853375345469,0.0085027301684,0.00849173869938,0.00827947258949,0.00769838271663,0.00769838271663,0.00752351945266,0.00750586343929,0.00750586343929,0.00746742310002,0.00746742310002,0.00744026852772,0.00700923986733,0.0069600106217,0.00687500555068,0.00685755442828,0.00665524043143,0.00631250673905,0.00628016749397,0.00571015663445,0.00517661636695,0.00502388458699,0.00502388458699,0.00500969868153,0.00499813817441,0.00499813817441,0.00499813817441,0.00498838443309,0.00498838443309,0.00497995084152,0.00477460538968,0.00455041741952,0.00453885970637,0.00453885970637,0.00453385710716,0.00444438355044,0.00395358679816,0.00385177740827,0.00384913850576,0.00384913850576,0.00384663674049,0.00357175269164,0.00354274269193,0.00351321138442,0.00336994603276,0.00336763705127,0.00336544797756,0.00336336693726,0.00292298570275,0.0029214087408,0.00287965382449,0.00277923489921,0.00266001210548,0.0026585131418,0.00252062571235,0.00232854182832,0.00232716859318,0.00232716859318,0.00232585705817,0.00232585705817,0.00232585705817,0.002324602101,0.00228202017024,0.00218296144158,0.00195979769342,0.00186022010166,0.00169473059941,0.00168933731038,0.00148262293078,0.00148262293078,0.00148262293078,0.00131501350552"

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,14295,"There was a reason why my parents never brought me here: They did not want me and my sister to get fat. Yes, that's how good their stuff is. We live only a couple of blocks away.The place doesn't seem too clean. Upon entering, the smell of dirtiness kinda hits you. Smelled like my dad's fast food place, heh. Then I looked to the right, and there's a colander full of disposed noodles over a bucket full of disposed soup from the noodle soups. Did I lose my appetite one bit? Nope, the nastier the place, the more delicious the food. And that also means you get to eat for super duper cheap.Sis and I ordered the fried pork and chive dumplings, scallion pancakes and beef stew noodle soup. The fried dumplings were ok. Quite salty to me, but it was juicy to the max. Greasy, yes, but that means the more tasty it is. We failed to locate the spicy vinegar sauce, which was a downer. We also were too health conscious to drizzle the spicy oil over the already oil drenched dumplings. But we did eat it with Sriracha to get the spicy kick. The scallion pancakes were pretty good. Nice crunchy exterior, with the insides soft and chewy. Wish they put more scallions though. Tastes great with Sriracha. The winner for us was the beef stew noodle soup. The noodles were amazing! The texture was perfect. The beef was nice and tender, unlike other places where the meat gets stuck in between your teeth, and it hurts like a bitch until you reach into your mouth and pull the little sucker out of the crevice. The soup base was perfectly seasoned. I hate cilantro, but the noodle soup was so good, that I didn't mind it one bit. We were so stuffed afterwards that we couldn't even eat dinner. Seriously, it was a lot of food, and we only paid $9!! What a steal! Yes, it definitely put a toll on our bodies, but it certainly saved our wallets, and sent our taste buds on an exciting ride. And did we get sick? Nope, absolutely not. We will be back to eat some more.P.S.-I told my parents about this place, and when my dad doesn't work, he comes here to get their fried dumplings or their beef stew noodle soup.

In comparison to the flushing hand-drawn noodle place, this one has better noodles (the consistency is so good!) but the flushing one (inside the mall) has better soup. Oh well, the better noodles win. With the influx of more customers, now they offer tubs to put sauce to go, they pack soup and noodle separately so it doesn't get soggy, etc. Everyone go try this place! So they can make more improvements to the environment. Frankly, the environment is quite uninhabitable for me. On a 20-degree night, the restaurant is 30 degrees inside.

The soup is served in a large bowl and there are seasonings of many sorts in the seated area.  I love sriracha and chili oil with soy sauce for mine.  It adds some heat.  Just so you know, the seating there is limited and it gets crowded during peak hours.  Lao Bei Fang is something I want everyone I know to experience and I am convinced that no one can leave unsatisfied from this little hole in the wall.  You won't spend more than $7.50 to get full....no joke.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,34067,"DISCLAIMER: Two separate reviews, this one for the former location around the corner up Whitney that has since been replaced by Lao Kou Wei. I was hooked ever since that freezing January day three years ago, drawn in by the loud smacks of dough diligently pulled into the fresh noodles that filled my heaping bowl of beef tendon noodle soup. A side of fried dumplings that were at the time on top of the game and perfectly fried scallion pancakes that were crisp and flattened to just the right thickness. A smorgasbord of cheap, satisfying grub that was best served by bringing a friend or two to sample and share. All washed down with a cold prunella tea and this became a regular part of the rotation. However, this all changed about a year and a half ago when the Lao Bei Fang team had their ""movin on up"" moment and moved to their new, gaudier locale just steps away.

The cold appetizers are very good as well, try the pork ear and stomach, beef tendon, tofu and cucumbers, cool and refreshing.When you're finished eating there is a soup reclamation area by the entrance.

You order at the counter and get your order when they call your number. So its kinda on the fast food side. Everything is designed to be self service, they are kind enough to offer free tea, but keeping the place tidy.seems to be a challenge since people are always coming in and out. The prices are very inexpensive, considering its New York.Food: First impression: I ordered the fried dumplings and though meaty and filling they were greasy. This is the kind of food you eat after a night at the bars. I also ordered the lamb with noodle soup. The challenge of lamb IMHO is to somehow mask its unique smell or flavor and bring out the lamb flavor that makes it yummy with the spices. They failed on the lamb, but the noodle chewy factor was good. Take note, I also find it entertaining to watch the noodle person make the noodles by the order counter.This is a place for a quick bite and to get a feel for the neighborhood (I notice all nationalities stop in for a quick cheap bite).",3.0 star rating,"Edison, NJ",2,1,0.20000000298,6.30000019073,"impression,place,strawberry shortcake pilgrimage,place,place,kind,Du Bois Bakery,dumpling quest,lamb,noodle quest categories,Ambiance,place,flurry,place,activity,customers,employees,spoon,order,Everything,challenge,self service,dumplings,impression,food,challenge,joint,number,counter,fast food side,people,tea,prices,Chinese,factor,noodles,lamb flavor,New York.Food,spices,noodle person,IMHO,feel,bite,bite,order,neighborhood,nationalities,flavor,bars,noodle soup,smell","7,7,4,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7","0.153408840299,0.105873174965,0.0707454830408,0.0536929816008,0.0501923672855,0.043626382947,0.0422060787678,0.0387548469007,0.0372960753739,0.0339488685131,0.0337763130665,0.0195454116911,0.0154597470537,0.0130973756313,0.0129526853561,0.0129526853561,0.0129526853561,0.0129526853561,0.0128311626613,0.0122064305469,0.0121359536424,0.0106209898368,0.00999431870878,0.00995322875679,0.00993642490357,0.0092218471691,0.00875068735331,0.00871888082474,0.00871888082474,0.00869428832084,0.00867424719036,0.00867424719036,0.008126353845,0.00767599837855,0.00702944677323,0.00655455095693,0.00646925577894,0.00589642766863,0.00589433684945,0.00588073860854,0.0058268038556,0.00524702016264,0.00465441541746,0.00465441541746,0.00465441541746,0.00407231692225,0.00407231692225,0.00295590679161,0.00259340251796,0.00258953217417,0.00258607510477"
Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,195053,"If you are used to the deep-fried mystery meat-filled dishes of most typical American-style Chinese takeouts in Queens, Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House is not for you. I'm not an expert in Chinese cuisine, but the food here strikes me as authentically Chinese, as Chinese people actually eat here. I suspect that is because the food is simply amazing. From the perfectly fluffy and succulent pork buns to aromatic and rich noodle soups, you really cannot find a dish here that isn't exceptionally tasty.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,24005,"Four solid stars, regardless of the negatives that are about to follow.Lao Bei Fang was once my dumpling mecca in all of NY. Note: was once, but I'm not saying I've strayed for another. I'll forever have a spot in my heart for this place. You should've seen the state of grief I went through when I thought Lao Bei Fang had sold the place because I didn't see the original owners behind the counter. It was a very miserable few weeks for me until I noticed their new location. They unfortunately (yes, unfortunately) moved down the block to expand.Since moving from their original location on Whitney Ave to a bigger space on Broadway with larger tables, flat screen TV's, an expanded menu, and hot pot (OK, getting weird now), the quality of the dumplings began to suffer. Here's the thing -- at the old Whitney Ave location, the dumplings used to come out fresh from the frying pan, still hot with a crispy bottom crust. At the new Broadway location, the dumplings are fried and left to sit inside a heated enclosure, causing them to come out warm with a soggier bottom crust. Not only has the quality gone down, but the dumplings have also shrunk in size.So what earns Lao Bei Fang a solid four stars even though this dumpling house's dumplings aren't extraordinary anymore? Their saving grace -- the HOT CHILI OIL. I had to emphasize that. Lao Bei Fang: bottle it and sell it. I would still pay for it at the market even though I sneakily take so much from you as it is!The noodle soups are all great and very filling, too. This is a great spot for a cheap, but quality lunch.And for cleanliness: they have an ""A"" rating. Don't complain if your table hadn't been wiped down before you sat there.

I mean hand-pulled noodles AND pan fried dumplings for under $10? How could you go wrong, right?Well... Okay, I won't be sooo brutal. Yes, this cafeteria style eatery is is cheap - and you definitely get what you pay for here. I can't help feel, though, that they're trying to emulate three really great places in Flushing (one for noodles, one for cold-a la carte innards, and one for dumplings). The dumplings, while they are okay, are generally waiting for you to order them regardless of whether you want them steamed or fried. They will be pre-finished, even during peak time, in advance and will most likely be sitting in a warming tray way before you enter the establishment. This is such a fried-food no-no! The a-la-carte is.. okay. The usual fare includes pig ears, seaweed, etc. The hand-pulled noodles come in the usual varieties (lamb, beef, etc) but are usually rubbery from both the batter and from being overcooked. The only thing I love about Lao Bei Fang is their chili oil. Perfection. Too bad it doesn't make up for the food it's served with.To sum it all up, Lao Bei Fang would not be a go-to place for me for dumplings, for cold meats,  or noodles but more of a back up place to go to.

Sometimes the two young sons are playing in or outside the restaurant.The seating area is short and very tight so watch out for bowl of hot soap being carried. I always get take-out and not really comfortable eating in such tight quarters. I just can't enjoy myself if I'm uncomfortable but if you want the freshness of the hand-drawn noodle experience then eat it right there!The noodles are great and fresh; you can watch the noodle maker stretch your noodles in less then a minute; she has it down to under 3o sec. these days and I finally was able to capture her flinging and stretching the noodles in middle air with my cheap camera. (see posted photo ""Whip it!"")The soap broth is tasty but sometimes on the salty side.  My favorite is beef flexor tendo noodle soup and fish ball noodle soup; both are only $4.95.The fried dumplings are good, the boiled veggie dumplings are OK; I think they over chopped the veggies (looks like they used a food processor because the pieces are so even).The sesame pancakes are great also; I have learn not to get to much pancake because it fills me up quickly.Enjoy...",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,4.0,"cut,traffic,noodle,Whitney Ave.,Lao Bei,note,banner,noodle soup,noodle maker,noodle maker,noodles,dumplings,noodles,noodles,add-ons,assortment,lunch,fan,family,menu,neon cardboards,dumplings,lady,veggies,husband,seating area,soap,store,bowl,quarters,eating,sons,noodle experience,freshness,veggie dumplings,dumplings,photo,fish ball noodle soup,side,both,pancake,noodles,sesame pancakes,food processor,pieces,soap broth,camera,air,flinging","7,7,7,2,3,7,5,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,2,6,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,5,6,7,1,7,7,6,6,6,7,7,7,7","0.103608973324,0.0881756544113,0.0737301036716,0.0526162907481,0.0526162907481,0.0467981360853,0.0423251129687,0.0389370284975,0.0312345419079,0.0286861732602,0.0282638370991,0.0218229908496,0.0173086561263,0.0162486322224,0.0161511227489,0.0161511227489,0.0161511227489,0.0161511227489,0.0161511227489,0.0160924922675,0.0160924922675,0.0146966017783,0.0134814577177,0.0133847948164,0.013311997056,0.0132744740695,0.012388812378,0.0108722085133,0.0108415447176,0.0108165554702,0.0108165554702,0.0104375779629,0.0098800426349,0.0098800426349,0.00932896789163,0.00932896789163,0.00854707323015,0.00840021297336,0.00736005464569,0.0068991119042,0.00581753673032,0.00567227276042,0.00546036148444,0.00535468570888,0.00477744219825,0.00395546620712,0.00323405512609,0.00323405512609,0.00323405512609"

Their noodle soup is perf for rainy and chilly days. I've had the mixed home style noodle soup, which is spicy. Although I appreciated the soup and the heat, I didn't really like how ""mixed"" the contents of the bowl really was... It came with prawn, calamari, some slices of beef, zucchini, bok choy, 2 fish balls and some 2 strands of thick glass noodles... Huh, what a medley! I've also had the brown sauce chicken noodle soup which had ample amount of chicken in it. (I believe the brown sauce refers to how they made the chicken? The cashier didn't really explain it to me well enough...) What really stood out to me was the noodles--duh. I love love love the chewiness of hand-pulled noodles. Don't wear a white shirt if you go here... These noodles are long and it's very possible that you will unknowingly have the soup splash onto your outfit, especially if you have to add like 2 tablespoons of hot oil into it like I do.I'm usually a fan of steamed dumplings but I had to try the pork and leek dumplings fried, thanks to the Yelp reviews. They left me satisified but I think I liked the chewy doughy wrapper more than the stuffing itself. (Do you see how important chewiness is to me yet?) They were very well worth $1.50 for 4 because they were a good size and juicy!One time I had to take home half of my noodle soup and they made me pay 25 cents for a the bigger plastic container?

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,20265,"After searching high and low for something inexpensive to serve at my bday party, came across Lao Bei Fang's reviews and read them carefully. Convinced by the majority of the reviewers' comments who were of Chinese heritage or who had traveled to China, this place won.So, I called to place an order for 48 x 3 dumplings. (uh.. math anyone?) They take only cash, so they couldn't place a credit card deposit, and I was on my bicycle all day. So I bicycled all the way from downtown Brooklyn to Elmhurst. A 10 mile ride.Needless to say, when I got there, I was hungry.I placed an order for 48 fried pork and leek dumplings, 48 pork and cabbage steamed, 48 steamed veggie, 6 veggie buns, and 4 scallion and meat pancakes. And a bowl of hand-pulled noodle soup with beef to eat right there. The price, a bit more than the other 4-5 star rated places, reflected the better quality. It still was less than $70 to feed 25 people including my soup.Lucy handled my order (see seemed like the manager or the owner). She was all about business, took care of my appetite, and treated me like a VIP.The soup rocked. And I don't usually like Chinese food.The next day, I drove a Zipcar to pick up my order and Lucy had 2 guys help load the car, parked in front of a fire hydrant right outside the door. I wanted to tip them, but the one guy refused.About 25 people enjoyed the food at a local watering hole (68 Jay Street bar in Brooklyn). I ate a scallion-meat pancake and some dumplings. The meat in the pancake was a little too sweet for my taste, but still yummy. Other people who ate the pancakes loved them.The fried pork and leek dumplings went first. Definitely the crowd's favorite. Afraid there would be leftovers, I had brought some small take out containers to the bar. Unnecessary.Everyone asked where the food came from.

My brother could not stop stuffing his face with the bun and the dumplings. When I asked him which one was better, he kept saying what ever he was currently eating. At the end, however, he decided that the pork fried dumplings were the best. He couldn't make a dent in his noodle soup. There was SO MUCH it's ridiculous that it costs less than $5 for a bowl of such large heaping pile of noodles and awesome soup. The veggie noodle soup was really great. It was loaded with vegetables and my favorite, mushrooms. They put in a couple of different types of mushrooms and there were leeks and bean sprouts. It was very refreshing.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,108493,"I used to eat spicy beef noodles for breakfast and lunch almost every single day while living in China. After a bit of yelping, I trekked over to Lao Bei Fang with high expectations, but found the noodle soup (beef and tendon, #27) disappointing. Service was fast and you get a HUGE portion for $5.50, so the price is right. Unfortunately, I could barely make it halfway through before feeling like the grease was congealing in my stomach. I have no problem with grease when a dish is worth it, but the broth itself was pretty flat, with little dimension beyond the initial saltiness. They were generous with the toppings but the beef was average - reasonably so though, considering the price. Same with the noodles, fresh and homemade, but far from the best I've had.

The noodles are hand pulled and they're seriously some of my favorite noodles ever. Perfectly chewy and al dente. You can witness the hand pulled noodles made in front of you. I've also tried their beef hot and spicy noodle soup (#64). I like how there is a variety of toppings including prawns, sliced beef, sliced rice cakes, spam, lotus root, zucchini, and bok choy. I was surprised to find out that this dish comes with glass noodles and not their hand pulled noodles, which was a little disappointing, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless. Beware this dish is spicy. I got the mild and it was borderline too spicy for me. That mala spice is no joke.Some other items I've tried: the steamed dumplings (good), scallion pancakes (not bad but prob wouldn't get again), and their cold appetizers (I'm a huge fan). The noodle soups here all range from $5.50 to $7 which is an amazing deal and you get a huge bowl. The dumplings are $3.75 for 8 dumplings and cold dishes are all around $4-6.

I am completely confident in saying these are the best ""one dollar"" type fried dumplings anywhere in town. I took a chinese friend here who grew up on beef noodle soup and she said this was better than her mother's. (!) I used to be a loyal patron of Fried Dumpling on Allen (RIP) until I discovered this place. Its probably the best example of some place one would discover in China and can be quite an experience in of itself. They are slamming and slapping the hand-made noodles all while you eat your food . They speak little English and the only table is a community style one in the middle of the room. As if that weren't enough to scare off the pickier westerners: as a bonus you get to dispose of your own soup broth/leftover food in a bucket in the corner and then bring your dirty dishes to the counter yourself. They have signs up telling you to do so - fun! Totally in love with this place and try to make a trip here about once a week. Leave your wimpy, picky non-adventurous germ-freak friends at home cause they won't be getting anything out of this place except for more of a reason to not eat great food. It's actually not really dirty - but it's not the cleanest looking place either and a bit run down. I would say for Chinese street food places its actually above average cleanliness despite what some people say on here. Most all good cheap eats in Elmhurst have zero traditional restaurant atmosphere - so I know not to ever expect anything in that regard. However, there is something to be said for atmosphere that is unusual and unique - I think too many people overlook that sometimes and just say it's ""bad"" or ""dirty"".  Also - I also believe their Mandarin sounds very Northern because I can actually understand a lot of what they say - no Cantonese heard here!",5.0 star rating,"Maspeth, NY",2,0,0.0,7.80000019073,"place,friend,germ-freak friends,dumplings,dumplings,noodle soup,all,community style,NYC,street food,anywhere,town,westerners,atmosphere,place,place,beef noodle soup,patron,mother,example,place,people,food,food,noodles,experience,one,Fried Dumpling on Allen,anything,middle,room,corner,counter,bucket,soup broth,bonus,signs,love,home cause,anything,RIP,dishes,something,restaurant atmosphere,trip,regard,eats,China,English,lot,Cantonese,place,place,food,Elmhurst,reason,more,bit,cleanliness,people,Mandarin,Chinese","7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,2","0.201003149152,0.185496643186,0.0729066506028,0.0658603161573,0.0482358783484,0.0482358783484,0.0439422316849,0.0239466167986,0.0229336600751,0.0206789970398,0.0184357352555,0.0184357352555,0.0114573836327,0.0113087948412,0.0105345882475,0.010510343127,0.00882142130286,0.00854335352778,0.00702305883169,0.0069617247209,0.00644984235987,0.00640111649409,0.00634487625211,0.00632472429425,0.00589557969943,0.00575780961663,0.0053538037464,0.0051934896037,0.00487453350797,0.00468467688188,0.00468467688188,0.00467769335955,0.00467769335955,0.00467769335955,0.00467769335955,0.00467769335955,0.00427507050335,0.00426991190761,0.00426520779729,0.0041753356345,0.00413354765624,0.00401803012937,0.00393862836063,0.00363215245306,0.00331408670172,0.00317793642171,0.0030593755655,0.00278426590376,0.00277413148433,0.0021968872752,0.0021968872752,0.00211275671609,0.00211061374284,0.00189093674999,0.00188143691048,0.00139789213426,0.00139789213426,0.0013964738464,0.00139516196214,0.00133530038875,0.00130042468663,0.000943892402574"

Dividing by halfs each time, a thinner strain of noodle with each twist and pull. I was great at math when I was a kid, but I was still left wondering how it multiplied so quick. My bowl of soup. Choose from the many similar styles of beef, pork, or vegetable or little known/ordered rice congee. My advice to you: come hungry or you won't finish. Their famous dumplings are thick shelled, steamed or pan-fried with those beautiful little fried oil crisps on the bottom. The insides always taste so fresh, again, with a similar style combination of pork and some veggetable stalk. 4/$1.25. To get a handle on how cheap that is, think of it this way: No human can eat double digits worth of dumplings.Scallion pancakes are 2.75 for about 4 full cakes worth. Taste great torn and sunken in your soup, you scalawag. The wife and husband ownership are a cute team. She is talkative and stern. He is stern.

But the noodles really missed the mark, in my opinion. You would think you can tell that the noodles are fresh and handmade, but I really couldn't. They tasted gummy and old. Probably among the worst handmade noodles I've ever had. The soup was all right, as were the beef and tendon in my order. But my boyfriend's beef noodle soup left much to be desired. The beef was different from the beef in my order. His were thin slices with fat in it... and not the good kind of marbling fat.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,2623,"So when I worked in flushing, I used to buy beef brisket soup on main st. Now I'm happy to say I've finally found an alternative that tastes similar and dare I say maybe better! It's the noodles. Now I didn't understand when I read other reviews about the texture but man oh man does it make it a difference. I really can't explain you really just have to try it :) Even the dumpling wrap is not as thick as in other places I've tried and they are not cheap with filling but the wrap is what makes the difference. Really yummy. Now for the soup, I'm in love. I bought the regular beef noodle soup and was surprised at the price and portion! It's pretty a big pretty portion and is only 5.95! Dumplings are really cheap too but I can't remember the price right now.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,22000,"I'm gonna go ahead and drop a 5 for Lao Bei Fang. TL;DR -- totally unpretentious, mostly self-service, giant portions of real Chinese food that's cheap as F.  Here's the long version what makes this hand-pulled noodle place so good:1) It's DELICIOUS-- I try to try a new dish every time, and I've never been disappointed. Most noodle places will use the same bland chicken broth for all their noodles and then just customize the bowl with toppings. However, this place has unique soups for each dish. For example, the Wonton Noodle Soup comes with a savory, briny, seaweed broth. On the other hand, the Lamb Noodle Soup comes with a thick, rich broth where you can taste the five spice. I am pretty salt-sensitive, and I've never felt thirsty or dehydrated after eating here so I'm pretty sure they don't use any MSG-- just natural delicious food.2) There's lots to choose from. They have 24 noodle dishes on the main menu. On top of that, they have a few specials which are posted to the side. You can also customize any noodle dish to your liking. Want to make it spicy? Just say so!They also have several side dishes, pancakes, baos, and boiled or fried dumplings to go with your noodles!3) It's made to order. As soon as the lady at the front takes your order, you will see the man in the back hand-pulling your noodles. It's fun to watch and he works fast! Because of this, the food is always fresh and the noodles are ALWAYS the PERFECT texture-- springy and al dente!4) The portions are giant. Seriously. Sometimes when they serve me my bowl or plate, I can't help but giggle at how ridiculously giant the amount of food is. I usually stuff myself with about half, and take the rest to go.5) It's cheap as fuck. Noodle dishes start at $4.50 and go to a whopping $6.50. An order of 8 dumplings will set you back $2.75. We can have a FEAST here for under $20.We find ourselves coming here most weekends, and when we don't... we sorely miss and crave it.

The noodles were also a disappointment- void of any flavor and did not absorb any of the broth. The place also needs a good cleaning and I don't mean because the place is older.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,107389,"After countless bowls of noodles, ma la tangs, and cold dish take outs, I finally got around to the hot pot that I salivate at every time I see someone else eating here. $20/person all you can eat includes drinks and cold dishes from their front display. Not a bad deal since all those plates of raw deliciousness can add up. They had a decent selection of your meats, veggies, tofus, starches, etc. Maybe 30 choices total. Not much seafood or any creative selections of pot base other than spicy and non-spicy though. I never care much for the non-spicy (boring!), but that fountain of magical spicy liquid always causes me to again, salivate on sight. Unfortunately, the taste itself, this time, was disappointing. Just lacked that ma-la spicy punch that should permeate anything that is cooked in the broth. Their sauce table located in the back had the standard stripped down fare, but the barbecue was extremely greasy. Combined with the overabundant oil sitting on top of the spicy pot base, my entire meal seemed to be coated with the stuff.Still, the pricing makes this a good deal for a first hot pot experience, as it allowed my roommate to explore this side of Chinese cuisine that few lao wei are bold enough to venture into, without having to worry about racking up the bill with things she would hate. Their cold dishes (fu qi fei pian, pig ears, seaweed, tofu noodles, shredded potatoes, plus 4 or so more) are all amazing and appropriately doused in fresh garlic.

Figured, it wasn't what I was looking for, but why not give it a try? Much to me & my husband's satisfaction: it was exactly what we were looking for without even knowing it. It was our favorite kind of Chinese eats. Delicious. Cheap. No Frills. Hole-in-Wall sentiment. Makes you feel like you're in China (he's been - I haven't). And to our shock: perfect.It was hard to imagine that the perfect dumpling/hand drawn noodle shop was JUST down the road, but it's true.  It was even more amazing to us as we had frequently gone out of our way to hit up the Pho place next to NY Supermarket when we didn't live in the area & this place exists just down the block.Since our discovery of this place two years ago, we've tried other ""authentic"" hand drawn noodle shops in Chinatown & they don't even compare. And I'm not just being biased cause I live in the area.Stick with the Beef Noodle Soup. I tried the other variation, I think it was Beef Noodle Stew or something & it wasn't nearly as good. The noodles are long & chewy. The broth is delicious & deep. The bok-choy is never overcooked and mushy. The meat can be a little fatty, but does melt well in your mouth more often than not.The dumplings are almost always perfectly crispy on the outside with a good layer of chewiness before a delicious meat.The frozen dumplings are smaller than the ones served at the restaurant, but are still very tasty.If dollar dumpling places are your sort of thing, this place is worth the distance from the city, from Brooklyn...from anywhere really. Parking can be annoying & its not the cleanest place ever, but what great dumpling place is? Also: if you want to get the soup to go try to ask for separate containers.

It has a B rating now even though it may have gotten an A in the beginning.This place is a bit of a dive but no worse for wear than some of the authentic places or holes in the walls in Chinatown. I ordered the Beef and Tendon noodle soup and was not disappointed. The noodles for a perfect consistency and the broth had a lot of beefy flavor. It was nice that they actually gave you a good portion of beef as well. I'm pretty sure they use MSG. My MSG radar went all crazy but it was still worth it.As stated by other yelpers, the portion size of the noodles are large but I managed to finish it all... to my detriment but that is another story.The noodle soup was so delicious and so inexpensive that I had to pick up a few other items to take back home to munch on. Here is what I ordered.1. Pork and chive dumplings- they were o.k.2. Scallion pancake - these were very good and were just as tasty when it was reheated. Caution: a bit on the oily side.3.

Let's just say I wasn't disappointed.First thing I tried was the dumplings, which are $1.25 for 4 (not quite as cheap as Chinatown). They were really good, but I would have preferred a thicker skin, as it managed to fall apart quite easily. Filling was tasty though!Next dish was the ~$5 mondo bowl of Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle Soup (which would have filled me easily on its own). A dark broth that tasted of 5-spice powder and beef was the medium for relatively thin hand-pulled noodles, baby-bok-choy type veggie, and thinly sliced beef (you can also get tendon if that's your cup of tea). Can't say it's the best broth/noodle combo I've ever had, but it's one of the best I've had in NYC. Noodles were just chewy/springy enough and had pretty good ""kou gan"" (mouth feel) and broth was satisfying.Like many of its counterparts, though, the seating is limited and cramped so be prepared for that.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,34074,"Lao Bei Fang is a blissful hole-in-the-wall dumpling/noodle shop in Elmhurst. To find it, just follow the scent of beef bouillon broth, scallions, soy sauce and star anise, which is kinda like Beijing in a bottle. I mean seriously! Lao Bei Fang has cracked the code in reproducing the faint smell that permeates the capital of the People's Republic. It's a distinctive ""Chinese-Chinese food"" smell, one that breathes authenticity. Pungent. Soy. Sweet. Anise. Delicious.But enough about smells.The beef noodle soup is amazingly simple, with a rich broth, tender slices of fatty meat, and hand-pulled Lanzhou style noodles. For less than $5 for a huge bowl, it's an experience that no one should forgo.The namesake dumplings themselves do not disappoint. $1.25 for 4! Medium doughy-ness, fried to a crisp on one side, soft and chewy all the way through, with the most amazing pork/chive filling inside. In my quietest of moments, I sometimes ponder the perfection that is Lao Bei Fang dumplings. How do they get them to be so good? The balance of crunch and chewiness. The saltiness of the pork, with the onion flavor of the scallions. All contrasted with the vinegar, soy sauce and chili dipping sauces.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,91213,"This is it.  The experience I had in Beijing.  The same kind at Lao Bei Fang Dumpling house.  No wonder it is ambience is categorized as "" Dive-y"".  Sure being a Westerner and coming into this joint you will have no idea what is going on.  From the clientele looking sharply at you, to the lady at the register changing her tongue to english for you, and the wittingly looking man crafting those hand made noodles.  You are back in the heart of real Northern Chinese culinary cooking my friend.           I unlike the typical Westerner not just want, but need my food ""Da La"".  Extra spicy.  I ordered the Mala Tang , Da La.  That's right.  Even sitting down popping the ""to go"" canister open ( the lady mixed up my order and thought it was to go.  There were a lot of people there,  its her way of saying maybe go eat at home while I get more customers.)  I added more spicy hot pepper sauce.  That red hot pepper oil with all the sesame seeds floating a top in the middle of the table with the lonely spoon in it.  I am a condiment freak.  Condiments are there for a reason.  The reason being is to amplify the dish and make your taste buds implode from the joy they are receiving.          The Mala Tang is superb.  I must say it is not as good as the famous Laoma Malatang out in flushing...but hell, on a cold night in the start of March it was like a Saint Bernard rescuing a downed skier in the alps.  Yes that good.  The flower pepper broth had numbed my lips and mouth as it should.  When I thought there were not that many ingredients, I had started digging through the noodles to uncover the treasures below.  Frozen tofu, lotus root, mushrooms,rice cakes,cabbage,zucchini,and other marvels.  In my opinion, its all about the layering.  This dish is the opposite of desert but as delightful as cake.  Below the lamb which sits on top are the noodles, then the broth, and last but not least the jewels of this soup. I highly recommend this dish to any foodie or spice junkie.           Lao Bei Fang also least we forget has excellent dumplings.  They have a cold appetizer bar where you can get treats like spiced pig ear or intestines.  Not for the faint of heart but for a true explorer.  If it looks like a dive, then you know the food is good!",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.10000000149,13.5,"condiment freak,Da La,Westerner,opposite,lady,experience,kind,house,wonder,ambience,joint,idea,clientele,lady,Lao Bei Fang Dumpling,Beijing,Dive-y,taste buds,noodles,lamb,heart,Westerner,man,register,tongue,english,hand,friend,noodles,customers,Mala Tang,dish,appetizer bar,broth,top,reason,reason,lot,hell,Condiments,order,canister,home,people,way,eat,pepper sauce,sesame seeds,spoon,table,middle,pepper oil,joy,start,skier,Northern Chinese,flower pepper broth,foodie,cake,top,dish,food,treats,marvels,opinion,layering,desert,soup,jewels,Laoma Malatang,Saint Bernard,dumplings,heart,dive,spice junkie,intestines,pig ear,faint,explorer,noodles,treasures,rice cakes,Lao Bei Fang,alps,lips,mouth,mushrooms,lotus root,cabbage,zucchini,tofu,ingredients","4,7,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.393198609352,0.0257098283619,0.0213914420456,0.0208578091115,0.0207595732063,0.018944978714,0.0188482720405,0.0188482720405,0.0187799558043,0.0187799558043,0.0187271349132,0.0187271349132,0.0186840873212,0.0139124244452,0.0127713540569,0.0112347695976,0.0111366966739,0.0110877463594,0.00897748209536,0.00824533775449,0.00815055146813,0.00813678372651,0.00751729914919,0.00714601809159,0.00714601809159,0.00714601809159,0.00714601809159,0.00713208178058,0.0061788293533,0.00615609996021,0.00615153135732,0.00597905693576,0.00570329651237,0.00562024582177,0.00545108318329,0.00544244609773,0.00543850613758,0.00527486391366,0.00519289262593,0.00510835507885,0.00478298543021,0.00478298543021,0.00477813649923,0.00477813649923,0.00477813649923,0.00477813649923,0.00477365124971,0.0047694798559,0.0047694798559,0.0047694798559,0.0047694798559,0.0047694798559,0.00435453280807,0.00434872228652,0.00434872228652,0.00422375183553,0.00414698570967,0.00406544841826,0.00370119768195,0.00369942747056,0.00358145823702,0.00344198336825,0.00329614430666,0.00324148847722,0.00323981139809,0.00323981139809,0.00323820090853,0.00323665188625,0.00323665188625,0.00323547958396,0.00257457350381,0.00255898502655,0.00255682202987,0.00255579291843,0.00223977863789,0.00223782006651,0.00223782006651,0.00223688967526,0.00223688967526,0.00178760220297,0.00162581680343,0.00162493938114,0.00151468534023,0.00142485729884,0.00142313586548,0.00142313586548,0.00142156600486,0.00142156600486,0.00142156600486,0.00142156600486,0.00142156600486,0.000615729310084"

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,5849,"I love how Chinese food can be a quick and cheap meal. Usually cheap Chinese food is at the sacrifice of quality, however this place does not disappoint serving a variety of tasty dumplings, buns, hand-drawn noodle soups, and soups. Don't be intimidated as they do a very good job of writing the English names just below each Chinese description. They go so far as to explain the tripe dish as honeycomb tripe, so you know exactly what to expect. When you're ready, order at the counter (the lady speaks Mandarin but also speaks very good English) and your food is usually ready in 2-3 minutes. If you order it to stay, there is a lengthwise table that seats about 8 people and another two high counters with stools seating another 6-8 customers. The seating is all very cramped and you'll be sitting back-to-back and side-to-side with one another, so unless you don't have a place to take your food to, I'd recommend taking it to go. In the summer time, it can be grueling, since you're eating hot soup, and there are only a few fans to circulate the air. On each table, there is soy sauce, watered down Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, and a homemade chili flake hot sauce.I ordered the Beef Stew Hand-Drawn Noodle Soup ($4.95) which is a decently sized bowl of very tasty beef broth, handmade noodles, delicious cubes of tender and fatty beef, cilantro (my favorite!), fresh baby bok choy, and some sort of Chinese pickled vegetable. What really shined were the handmade noodles, which you can watch the chef in the kitchen prepare as he twirls the dough in the air and spins it multiple times to give it a nice and airy texture. As soon as he was done prepping the dough into noodles, he would throw it into the boiling water to be served minutes later. It don't get fresher than that! I also ordered the Fresh pork and Chives Fried Dumplings (4 dumplings for $1.25) which were greasy but very tasty. Quite a few people were coming in and making several orders of these dumplings to go, and strengthening the consensus that these dumplings were quite popular. I might even venture to say that these dumplings might be just as good as my favorite dumpling shack located adjacent to the municipal parking lot on 41st Ave. in Flushing.  I also tried the Beef Hand-Drawn Noodle Soup ($4.95) which is a variation of the latter, but with slices of beef rather than chunks of beef found in the beef stew. I'm definitely a fan of their noodle soup and dumplings and will be finding myself coming back here again soon. When you're done eating, make sure to pour out the juices/broth in the white bucket near the front entrance. Although some put their empty bowls next to the garbage by the front window, empty bowls should be placed on the countertop by a small opening just to the left of the soda refrigerator.",4.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,11.3000001907,"Noodle Soup,food,fan,noodles,chef,Mandarin,food,dumplings,noodle soups,soups,names,table,job,dough,variety,place,quality,sacrifice,buns,description,English,place,food,counter,counters,honeycomb tripe,order,people,food,beef,soy sauce,tripe dish,lady,soup,some,dumplings,another,sauce.,seating,air,table,beef broth,chili,beef,beef,times,air,noodle soup,customers,stools,cilantro,fatty,cubes,fans,vegetable,sort,baby bok choy,favorite,kitchen,dough,beef stew,Chives Fried Dumplings,dumplings,Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,Beef Stew Hand,dumpling shack,parking lot,chunks,slices,latter,texture,countertop,bowls,bowls,Beef Hand,dumplings,juices,entrance,bucket,garbage,window,opening,left,soda refrigerator,orders,Flushing,41st Ave.,broth,people,water,pork,consensus,dumplings","7,7,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,4,7,6,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,7,7","0.183888807893,0.16729362309,0.0895015150309,0.0453457087278,0.0358668938279,0.0278565846384,0.0203450620174,0.0201621502638,0.0185698121786,0.0185698121786,0.0181130282581,0.0167211033404,0.0151828443632,0.0149130504578,0.0147948469967,0.0140667809173,0.0123141948134,0.0123141948134,0.0123141948134,0.0122513119131,0.0108906691894,0.0107296612114,0.00770550733432,0.00584764452651,0.00583416363224,0.00533434469253,0.00531929451972,0.00530702853575,0.00492668431252,0.00492473691702,0.00486141862348,0.00466769281775,0.00465451972559,0.00460187112913,0.00459666270763,0.00425999471918,0.0039321212098,0.00391962146387,0.00383267877623,0.00357054895721,0.00356522412039,0.00356522412039,0.00356522412039,0.00334322010167,0.00334322010167,0.00325824972242,0.00325824972242,0.0031968629919,0.00313545926474,0.00313545926474,0.00311938882805,0.00311938882805,0.00311938882805,0.00293222558685,0.00285456748679,0.00285456748679,0.00285456748679,0.00285456748679,0.00285075814463,0.00275998050347,0.00241987407207,0.00240968796425,0.00240468489937,0.00232086447068,0.00232086447068,0.00211887760088,0.00211887760088,0.0021171446424,0.0021171446424,0.0021171446424,0.00202448107302,0.00183803599793,0.00183803599793,0.00183803599793,0.00157502037473,0.00152719172183,0.0014635353582,0.0014635353582,0.0014635353582,0.00146253220737,0.00146253220737,0.00146253220737,0.00146253220737,0.00146253220737,0.00137002102565,0.00125424889848,0.00125424889848,0.00124964863062,0.00106307887472,0.00093287229538,0.000930897658691,0.000930023030378,0.00066120212432"

I normally would have preferred to eat a balanced protein and carbo meal, but I will forgive this one for the tasty soup and chewy noodles.Overall, I would say that this is the kind of noodles I would expect from a good Chinese noodle store and top that with affordable prices, this place is definitely a good place to check out for noodle fans.",4.0 star rating,"ASTORIA, NY",1,0,0.40000000596,2.20000004768,"poster,some,things,noodles,place,more.,kind,dumpling,standards,store,noodles,scarcity,dumpling,price,price,quantity ratio,meat,amount,noodle,beef,meat toppings,place,place,prices,noodle fans,top,Chinese,soup,carbo,protein,meal","5,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7","0.240630462766,0.123629286885,0.101694144309,0.092309564352,0.0472012534738,0.0426990427077,0.0418744273484,0.0379854664207,0.0268456880003,0.0187314730138,0.0183865409344,0.0176941398531,0.0174608007073,0.0160818528384,0.0160818528384,0.0156766790897,0.0146329151466,0.0142774544656,0.0137043436989,0.0128086963668,0.010950030759,0.00937676150352,0.00925890170038,0.0075620082207,0.00601935805753,0.00601935805753,0.00514775328338,0.00381493405439,0.00381493405439,0.00381493405439,0.00381493405439"

We walked away with 20 pieces of dumplings and two bowls of beef stew noodles and a wonton soup. The noodles are freshly made, so they soak up the flavors from the beef stew. It's best eaten right away since they get soft rather quickly and lose their texture. It was so good, like how my grandmother made it.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,39804,"I usually go to Lao Bei Fang for a quick, cheap meal before grocery shopping in Elmhurst. Lao Bei Fang is known for their potstickers/dumplings and beef hand-pulled noodle soups, as advertised on their outdoor signage. If you don't specify what kind of potstickers (pan fried) or dumplings (boiled) you'll get the pork & leek ones, though the boiled dumplings also come in pork & celery, pork & cabbage, vegetable, and more. I'm a fan of their pork & leek boiled dumplings because the skin isn't too thick or doughy and they're generous with the filling. yelp.com/biz_photos/3K7K… Mix Sriracha and soy sauce for dipping and voilà~ simple and delicious! I'm not as big a fan of their beef noodle soups because the broth is very one-note in my opinion. Yes it's beef-y but I don't taste any ginger or star anise. It's also a little too salty and a little too oily for my liking, but keep in mind that I'm very picky about beef noodle soup because I make it at home. That said, Lao Bei Fang's beef noodle soups are decent and I like that you can choose what kind of beef you want in your noodle soup (#22-27 on their menu). Aren't familiar with the different kinds? Or don't read Chinese? Well never fear! Here's my handy dandy guide to beef noodle soup at Lao Bei Fang:#22 NIU ROU - This translates simply to beef, but it refers to the meatier cuts with little fat like beef shank or boneless beef short rib.  #22a NIU WEI - Ox tail#23 NIU NAN - To my knowledge, niu nan can be either beef flank or brisket. Sometimes at Chinese supermarkets it's simply labeled ""stew beef"". It's a flat cut of beef that has the connective tissues attached on both sides so it has a chewy section attached to the meaty portion. yelp.com/biz_photos/3K7K…#24 NIU DU - Honeycomb tripe (cow stomach)#25 NIU JIN - Niu jin is tendon, but because it's been stewed, the texture will be soft enough to easily chew. #26 NIU ZA - Za means mixed. In the case of Lao Bei Fang, this includes tendon and tripe.#27 BAN JIN BAN ROU - Half tendon, half meatHopefully that was helpful. If you're a clever cookie, you've figured out that ""niu"" means cow/beef. #22, #23, and #27 are the most popular versions of beef noodle soup. If you want leaner meat stick to #22, if you want something fattier get #27, and if you want something chewier get #23. Since their hand-pulled noodles are really good, I've taken to ordering the preserved radish and shredded pork noodles (#16) instead of the beef noodle soup. yelp.com/biz_photos/3K7K… Besides dumplings and hand-pulled noodles, Lao Bei Fang also has a selection of pre-made cold dishes, malatang, and hot pot, all of which I have yet to try. Since I'm usually on my own when I eat at Lao Bei Fang I can't order too much, but I'd definitely like to gather a couple friends to try their hot pot.

Sure, the service wasn't fantastic. To us, it was familiar and it was a great place to have some hot tea and hot pot at a relatively low price. We would sit there for hours and never got kicked out. First, I was apprehensive about this new fangled place. And for the $18 price tag for hot pot, I wasn't exactly on board. But my friend was paying so I agreed to go to dinner here. We were pleasantly surprised. For that price we had many options of hot pot to choose from including pork, shrimp, chicken, beef, fish, etc, etc. That price also includes a drink, a cold dish, a pancake, a bun, and tip. I believe they recycled Oz's tables and chairs, so there was a sense of familiarity I liked. The changed the little stoves that the hot pot goes on, thankfully. They are electric and work nicely. My friends and I had a lot of food and I believe there isn't a limit to how many plates you can order. And the food itself was pretty good! I don't recommend the beef balls. They were hard, even after boiling them for 20 minutes. Everything else was great!The service was just fine. The waitress understood Mandarin more than English.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,7742,"The hype is real. A huge bowl of delicious hand-pulled noodles in a hearty beef stew with bok choy for only $5 and a huge plate of pan-fried dumplings for only $2... food aside, you can't get a better deal on a meal anywhere else in Elmhurst. The quantity of food is insane for how little you're paying. The food itself is great too, albeit, the prices are making me a bit biased. You are definitely not getting anything super fancy or high-quality, but you are getting really filling, well-cooked food. The hand-pulled noodles are the best! I've had hand-pulled noodles several times before and I must say, the chef in the back who does the pulling is one talented noodle puller! To get the noodles to such a nice consistency, to get the chewiness just right, to maintain the same width throughout, and to never have the noodles break... that's art! Everything else is decent, just elevated to greatness due to the sheer quantity and dirt cheapness. To be honest, the broth of the soup was a little too salty and a bit too heavy on the soy sauce for me. The bok choy wasn't as fresh as the bok choy I'm used to but I'm just being nitpicky. The meat was mostly bone and tendons but then again, you are paying next to nothing for a huge bowl of soup noodles. The pan-fried pork dumplings were great though a bit over-fried/dry in one or two corners (probably cause they were reheated). But, once again, for the price, I don't mind. These dumplings were large, filling, and nicely seasoned. All in all, the meal left my bf and I quite satisfied. I'd come back here just for the noodles! One thing to note: It's an ""order then seat yourself"" place and you clean up after yourself afterwards at the trashcans by the doors. On a slight tangent, the trashcan for dumping soup is quite interesting, with a metal mesh separator that hangs over the top to catch the noodles... I thought it was clever, but my bf thought it was a bit gross. *Shrug* Hey, I don't see any better way of taking care of soupy substances. Besides, they're graded A (something you don't see often in Elmhurst).Food: 3.5/5 -- Decent food, made exceptional by the cheap prices. The noodles, though, are fantastic regardless of price!! I'd recommend this place solely for their masterfully pulled noodles!Service: 3/5 -- Fast, attentive, friendly, and a huge plus that they hire workers who can understand and speak fluent English. You don't usually get that at small family-owned Chinese restaurants.Atmosphere: 3/5 -- Nothing remarkable. Just a small, slightly cramped, casual deli-esque environment. Overall: 3.5/5 -- I'd give this place a 4 if the environment was a little tidier but overall, it's a fantastic pulled-noodles shop with decent food all around for super cheap prices.",3.0 star rating,"Harrisburg, PA",3,1,0.20000000298,14.1000003815,"noodles,hype,chewiness,thing,food,noodles,bowl,food,food,quantity,deal,dumplings,bok choy,environment,chef,meal,meat,anywhere,plate,beef stew,noodles,corners,Elmhurst,noodles,food,prices,bit,noodles,soup noodles,noodle puller,plus,noodles,bok choy,anything,back,times,bit,price,soup,bok choy,noodles,Everything,broth,noodles,workers,quantity,bowl,nothing,meal,Food,food,all,trashcans,consistency,width,greatness,cheapness,dirt,soy sauce,tendons,prices,price,bf,separator,place,food,Service,prices,place,noodles,pork dumplings,Nothing,dumplings,Atmosphere,shop,trashcan,English,soup,care,bf,way,doors,tangent,top,Shrug,substances,something,Chinese","7,7,5,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2","0.0661191791296,0.0508449450135,0.0482971630991,0.0433989465237,0.0379479117692,0.0366903841496,0.0331293269992,0.0313072316349,0.0311479624361,0.0276373233646,0.0255816411227,0.0249519050121,0.0249519050121,0.0240039806813,0.0232898052782,0.0227068793029,0.0215442553163,0.0198795124888,0.0198795124888,0.0198795124888,0.0138549888507,0.0127651337534,0.0124063724652,0.0120357265696,0.011861467734,0.0108211906627,0.0101912701502,0.00934507604688,0.00929724331945,0.00928221084177,0.00866602826864,0.00847148150206,0.00753910280764,0.00751685770229,0.00748489936814,0.00748489936814,0.00680385669693,0.00658377865329,0.00632181065157,0.00631418311968,0.00630338490009,0.00617019133642,0.00600780919194,0.00591971725225,0.00585230439901,0.00575799494982,0.00573704764247,0.00573704764247,0.0055029951036,0.0053777648136,0.0053777648136,0.00523105124012,0.00522325048223,0.0050455853343,0.0050455853343,0.00503806071356,0.00503806071356,0.00503806071356,0.00503133889288,0.00501972856,0.0048914947547,0.00488874036819,0.00460846861824,0.00381500204094,0.00376613251865,0.0037141747307,0.0034019916784,0.00337818870321,0.00307014212012,0.00277388538234,0.00272973068058,0.00269077369012,0.0024933568202,0.00235408917069,0.00235179299489,0.00209530047141,0.00201385561377,0.00188069825526,0.00176241341978,0.00170937809162,0.0015524784103,0.00149744004011,0.0014964134898,0.0014964134898,0.00149451510515,0.00149451510515,0.00149363349192,0.00139336974826"

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,9306,"People have been mentioning this place and I became curious.  With its 4 star rating, dumplings, and hand-pulled noodles, I felt like it was time for me to try it.  But after checking it out twice, I have banned the joint.  Let me tell you why....2 weeks ago i stopped by for lunch with PC.  Upon arrival, we figured it was a self serve type of place where you ordered and picked up food from the counter.  So we placed our orders and waited.  While waiting, I noticed how popular the place was with a steady stream of customers.  The focus of Lao Bei Fang appears to be low prices supplemented with a high turnover.  As a result, the tables were filthy from neglect.  Consider it a lucky day if the grime on your table was from less than three customers prior!!!  Needless to say (but i will because it's my review!), I took the time to wipe the table down...When our food arrived, we were glad to see it was plentiful relative to the price.  Here's what we ordered....1.  eight pork and leek fried dumplings for $2.75 (no tax charged):yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…A lot of dumplings at a low price.  But  I'm not a fan of them.  The skin is too thick and it's like eating chunks of dough. 2.  eight pork and leek boiled dumplings for $2.75 (no tax charged):yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…I thought they had steamed dumplings because it said so in the dumpling section header of the menu.  But in the list of items they did not and only had pan fried or boiled.  So I wound up ordering these pathetic boiled dumplings instead.  They were the same as the fried dumplings as in....TOO MUCH DOUGH.  Some people might like it, but i like thin skinned dumplings, packed with filling, and STEAMED.  I don't know why people are calling them steamed.  The menu item line says boiled and do you really think they took the time to steam when they do such high volume?  THEY ARE BOILED AND NOT VERY TASTY, people.3.  beef tendo & tripe hand pulled noodle soup for $5.25 (no tax charged):yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…PC ordered it.  He said it was plentiful, but it was whatevers.4.  pork hand pulled noodle soup for $4.50 (no tax charged):yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…I liked the soup as it was a little spicy and had good flavor.  I definitely liked the pork which was super tender.  As for the hand-pulled noodles, sure they were fresh, but i didn't care for them.  It was like bland spaghetti which proved uneventful.  I'm glad the noodle guy took the time to make them from scratch though.  But the hand-pulled noodles here are probably foodie hype which isn't warranted.So that was the meal.  We left thinking it was pretty lame for a place to be called a dumpling house to have such inferior dumplings and could do without the hand-pulled noodles.  FUN FACT: i woke up in the middle of the night with my stomach grumbling.  I believe the food had upset my stomach.  But I'm not 100% sure...BUT THERE'S MORE:  I went back last week to see if my experience was a fluke as I couldn't believe my opinion was so off from the 4 star consensus.  I decided on a takeout order of spicy beef stew glass/clear noodles for $5.75 (no tax charged):yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…  They looked OK in the container.  But after I poured it into a bowl, not so much:yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…If you're cheap, it's a great deal.  But there's way too many vegetables, roots and fungus for me.  AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DAMN SOUP?!?!....yelp.com/biz_photos/lao-…The soup was not a soup at all.  It  was just chili oil.  It was like eating a chili oil entree out of a soup bowl.  I tried the ""soup"" and it was the equivalent of drinking the chili oil condiment jar at an Asian restaurant; utterly disgusting...    I was raised to finish my meals, but I threw this out after finishing less than half.  Later that night my stomach was grumbling again.  It's pretty obvious to me that the food here isn't as clean as it should be and I won't be returning.  I'm giving the restaurant a well deserved 1 star rating.  I think other reviewers have been blinded by the cheap prices and overlooked everything else in-between.  But if cheap prices were the key to a high rating, I'd be writing 5 star reviews for Costco because they give free samples all day....",1.0 star rating,"New York, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,23.5,"arrival,noodles,place,People,foodie hype,PC,review,dumplings,place,food,place,star rating,chili oil,equivalent,soup,orders,joint,lunch,counter,stream,pork,dumplings,prices,spaghetti,food,price,tax,yelp.com/biz_photos/lao,pork,table,table,same,dumplings,dumplings,dumplings,dumplings,dumplings,fried dumplings,grime,customers,customers,noodle soup,noodle soup,hand,turnover,focus,neglect,result,price,tax,tax,pork,people,people.,soup,tax,pork hand,volume,place,skin,prices,soup,dough,menu,items,DOUGH,beef,SOUP,soup,noodle guy,lot,fan,dumpling section header,list,tripe,chunks,menu item line,people,flavor,scratch,Lao Bei Fang,star reviews,food,tables,vegetables,bowl,soup bowl,restaurant,container,deal,roots,fungus,chili oil condiment jar,prices,chili oil entree,STEAMED,stomach,star rating,reviewers,rating,warranted.So,dumplings,meals,restaurant,noodles,half,everything,key,dumpling house,food,tax,Asian,stomach,opinion,experience,samples,fluke,stomach grumbling,FACT,star consensus,beef stew glass,Costco","4,7,7,1,7,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,3","0.11030460149,0.05485964939,0.0405914336443,0.0405914336443,0.0391455926001,0.0360163860023,0.0358774475753,0.0258109997958,0.022745732218,0.0203213170171,0.0191398561001,0.0179937891662,0.0178457740694,0.0178352836519,0.0167399886996,0.0161443743855,0.0142535017803,0.0142017230392,0.014161689207,0.0141015360132,0.0137914698571,0.00964215025306,0.00945637840778,0.0083229932934,0.00769062247127,0.00769062247127,0.00767436390743,0.0073243570514,0.00722704688087,0.00698978453875,0.00673721125349,0.00673172809184,0.00663739442825,0.00651074480265,0.00648865057155,0.00648865057155,0.00647951196879,0.00647530192509,0.0064024743624,0.00615574466065,0.00612798379734,0.00587309617549,0.00586737086996,0.00540632428601,0.00537677668035,0.00537677668035,0.00536875566468,0.00536875566468,0.00518131442368,0.00516372639686,0.00513854622841,0.00486259534955,0.00484672933817,0.00484138680622,0.00476509425789,0.00469766138121,0.00458051869646,0.00444261077791,0.00441244477406,0.00441048201174,0.00436405651271,0.00425130547956,0.00411562807858,0.00410910276696,0.00410612626001,0.004100644961,0.00408906070516,0.00399018172175,0.0038378268946,0.00365935498849,0.00360725563951,0.00360386772081,0.00359500665218,0.0035924022086,0.00357747031376,0.00351055478677,0.00349157978781,0.00327353808098,0.0032704314217,0.00326470751315,0.00318311690353,0.00312471855432,0.00295529700816,0.00292216148227,0.00283048930578,0.00277953129262,0.00277609191835,0.00277528259903,0.00243249488994,0.0024316937197,0.00243091303855,0.00243091303855,0.00242797657847,0.00241129170172,0.00236785551533,0.00212226225995,0.00211120699532,0.00211006752215,0.00210951594636,0.0021089753136,0.00193161331117,0.00192929897457,0.00192066037562,0.00191908876877,0.00175213045441,0.00168026553001,0.00167845154647,0.00167802150827,0.00156326789875,0.00153390329797,0.00153282238171,0.00143702281639,0.00134190218523,0.00127470155712,0.00127470155712,0.00119138509035,0.00113716756459,0.00106805108953,0.00106805108953,0.00106727692764,0.00106690602843,0.000993089401163"
Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,121024,"Some of my friends consider me a food snob. I am proud to admit that I am, but not in the conventional sense. I love great tasting food, and everything else is ancillary. Case in point, Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House.   The food rocks. everything else doesn't, including the sticky floors, the lack of a bathroom, the 10 seats available for the 20 people waiting for those 10 seats, etc. Yet I enjoyed this joint immensely b/c..the food was delish to the max. And at $5 for soup, and $1.25 for 4 fried dumplings, you can't find a better value anywhere else. I would recommend the friend dumplings (just say 4 dumplings at the counter) with the beef noodle soup. If you don't mind looking like a caveman, ask for the pork bone noodle soup. Oh, I hate cilantro, so make sure to ask for NO CILANTRO. and like most chinese places that are non-americanized, they spoke to me in chinese (I'm korean). Don't be afraid to speak english though, the woman server is surprisingly fluent. ----Additional ratings: Food: 8/10 Decor: 1/10 Service: n/a* Value: 10/10 * the owner did offer a second bowl for my pork bone scraps, which was nice of her",4.0 star rating,"Hoboken, NJ",2,1,0.300000011921,6.80000019073,"friends,Some,food snob,tasting food,sense,everything,owner,value,food,everything,Case,point,food rocks,lack,pork bone scraps,dumplings,soup,dumplings,friend dumplings,beef noodle soup,seats,seats,pork bone noodle soup,bathroom,people,max,joint,anywhere,Food,woman server,counter,caveman,Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,floors,places,english,ratings,Decor,Service,Value,n,bowl,korean,cilantro,chinese,CILANTRO.,chinese","1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,2,7,7,7,2","0.117870226502,0.10740250349,0.103494949639,0.0735390558839,0.0498235076666,0.0266195368022,0.0262188967317,0.0228868499398,0.021803079173,0.0215656366199,0.0189751535654,0.0189751535654,0.0189217571169,0.0188782382756,0.018183702603,0.0171796511859,0.0159652289003,0.0157018750906,0.0151176098734,0.014591534622,0.0145778404549,0.0145778404549,0.0145721109584,0.0127584254369,0.0127584254369,0.012733573094,0.012733573094,0.0127120846882,0.0124068269506,0.0121057834476,0.0116174807772,0.01160200499,0.011250118725,0.0111009404063,0.00908876862377,0.00865173060447,0.00864296685904,0.00864296685904,0.00684135919437,0.00684135919437,0.00598605582491,0.00598605582491,0.0051297256723,0.00434458255768,0.00380112696439,0.00257198652253,0.0022501363419"
Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,12841,"I've bookmarked Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House for quite some time and was super excited to finally come by on Saturday for lunch. This place is almost always crowded but luckily there were plenty of seats when I got here around 12:45pm - it did fill up soon after. You stand in line to order and pay, then take your receipt with the number and seat yourself. When your number is called, you get your food. Self-service, no tipping necessary. Help yourself to some hot tea and sauces, but strangely the utensils are behind the counter. As I wasn't particularly hungry, the husband and I decided to share 1 order (8 pieces) of steamed pork and leek dumplings, 1 order (8 pieces) of pan fried pork and leek dumplings, and a bowl of beef hot & spicy (#64 from the back of the menu). - Pork and leek dumplings: Very delicious, definitely one of the better dumplings I've ever had. Generous in size too. I prefer the steamed ones over the pan fried ones as I felt the skin on the latter was a little too thick and chewy. My husband said he saw the pan fried dumplings come out of a steamer so who knows how long these were fried prior to and just sitting there keeping warm until it's sold. They sell a pack of 50 frozen pork and leek dumplings for $13.50 - I'd definitely be buying them next time to make at home. Yum.- Beef hot & spicy: I was disappointed at first when I received the order and saw that this noodle soup does not come with hand-pulled noodles, but vermicelli. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it and cannot wait to order this again in the future - perhaps I can ask them to see if I can substitute the noodles next time? The broth was perfectly spiced, there were a generous amount of fatty beef, and a variety of mumbo jumbos in there such as sliced rice cakes, spam, lotus root, fried tofu, cilantro, and miscellaneous veggies. Fabulous!This restaurant surprisingly has an ""A"" in sanitation letter grading - like, really ridiculously surprising. The restaurant is dark, dingy, and just sort of gives me the heebie jeebies. However as a Chinese-American I grew up thinking that the dirtier the place is, the better the food. Haha.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,4776,"I am going to start with the positives. The portions are generous especially with the price you are paying for the dishes. In addition, you can taste that the noodles are hand pulled because they are very soft. The thickness of the noodles are also perfect. I also ordered boiled dumplings. They are good but nothing special. I have definitely had better.My negatives are mainly with the beef stew soup noodle that I ordered. Again, the noodles are great. However, I did not like the broth at all. It did not agree with my taste buds. In a noodle soup, the broth is critical because it adds most of the taste. In terms of the other ingredients in the dish, the beef is decent but I have eaten better and more tender beef. The bok choy was also sparse, maybe a couple of pieces.In comparison, I ate at my favorite hand pulled noodle spot in New York, Lam Zhou Hand Pulled noodles, down in East Broadway in Chinatown a few days before I tried Lao Bei Fang. The noodles are comparable at both spots. However, Lam Zhou has a tasty broth, great and very tender beef, and a lot of boy choy in their beef stew noodle soup. In addition, they have some of the best boiled dumplings anywhere compared to the average ones at Lao Bei Fang.I mulled giving Lao Bei Fang 2 stars because the description for 2 stars matches what I feel about : ""Meh.

(FYI my fav: steamed dumplings, scallion pancakes, and wonton noodles.)This place was a hole-in-the-wall before. It was smaller, and the countertops and the floor were kept clean. Now, with more seatings, they don't seem as attentive to it anymore.Cleanliness should be one of the highest priorities at a restaurant. I once saw a table whose underside is smothered with chili oil. I noticed it before I sat, because I tried to move the table. I wiped it clean but it might have ruined customers' clothes if went unnoticed.About what customers are asked to do to the leftover soup: It is a mess, but it seems to be an effort to separate the solids from the liquids. They could make it more efficient (eg installing a small sink - as some coffee shops are doing) - but customers effort to not spill would help, too. Common sense and a good manner goes a long way.

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,11966,"I cannot express in words how much I love this place. The guy who stands behind the counter and pulls the noodles by hand is also fabulous, especially when you come at off-hours and he's singing Chinese opera songs. This place specializes in Northern Chinese style hand-pulled noodles and dumplings. I've read that the wife and husband owners came from Lanzhou in Gansu province where shou la mian (hand-pulled noodles) purportedly originated, but I'm not completely sure. Every time I come to New York, the first thing I always do is come out here to get hand-pulled noodles (usually the beef stew -- so good!!!! And it has fresh basil to make it even more fragrant!) and their fried dumplings. Everything here is so cheap -- a bowl of niu nan shou la mian (the beef stew hand pulled noodles) costs only $4.75, and 4 large, fresh, juicy and crisp fried dumplings cost only one buck! The noodles always have the perfect texture and chewiness. I get nostalgic for this place whenever I think of New York. It's such a hole-in-the-wall, but I actually love that about this place. All the utensils are disposable (chopsticks, forks, etc.) as well as the styrofoam plates. The only thing you have to return are the bowls for the noodle soups. You order and pay at a small counter, and there are just two tables and a counter where you can sit and wait for your food and eat. From the counter window you can watch the owner pull the noodles, which is pretty cool if you've never seen these noodles being made. Go see the photos I've posted!

Lao Bei Fang Dumpling House,5394,8305 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,32271,"Cheap...so Cheap...but GoodFood: 3.5 StarsNo matter what you order, the quantity of food you receive far exceeds the price you paid for it. The overall quality of the food is solid as well. I would rate the food higher, but I have to value you it at the overall taste and quality and not let the price influence me in any way.Fried Pork & Leek Dumplings:Without knowing it I was served these dumplings over the course of many events (Super Bowls) and devoured dozens (don't judge) of them over that period of time. I have always enjoyed them and recently I learned they come from this restaurant. They are filled rather generously and while are a bit oily, the flavor is good.Pork Buns:I wish I had taken a picture of the dumpling to show the size of this monstrosity in comparison to the price I paid. Now the majority of the portion is dough, but the inside, like the pork & leek dumpling is filled generously. For $1 this was by far the biggest bang for my buck.Soup:*Note I ordered the shredded pork, but I didn't see much pork in there*Even though I was given the wrong soup I took it anyway because it looked good (although the vegetables were too high in quantity [Veggies are EVIL]). The broth had the same flavor as every other restaurant I've been to that serve similar foods, however it didn't have the overpowering taste of raw vegetables many other places have. Therefore the flavor was better.The noodles were mismatched and held a different overall consistency in every bite. Hand-pulled noodles are the best.Service/Speed: 4.5 StarsI received my dumplings within 5 minutes of ordering them and my soup approximately 2-4 minutes after. The orders are called out in English and what I assume is Chinese (don't know if Mandarin or Cantonese).While there is nothing spectacular about the service, the fact that they get the food out so fast tells you a lot about the efficiency in the kitchen. Throughout my entire meal there was always someone ordering food.Ambiance: 2 StarsThere is no waiter service in this restaurant. It follows a similar system to what you would find at a mall food court. Have a friend hold a table while you place your order and get a receipt. The kitchen looks clean, but the dining area is pretty grimy. The garbage and the soup dumping area are very close to some diners. Hearing the splash and plop of the soup hitting the bottom of a garbage can weakens the appetite a little.I expect the cleanliness factor to be a bit worse in a mall, not in a restaurant. I would recommend getting takeout because while the food is excellent, the restaurant itself could use a little more care.Maybe I'm a little spoiled in the restaurants I've eaten at over the years.Overall: 3.25 StarsIf you spend more than $10 here you either:1. Have a gigantic appetite2. You're having a party3. Your eyes are bigger than your stomach and you will have a lot of leftovers.I would recommend getting takeout because while the food is good, the restaurant itself could use a little more care.Note: The prices are perfect for takeout and large parties.
