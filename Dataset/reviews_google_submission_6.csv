Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4684,"The food here is terrific, and got better as the night went on. The ceviche was only so-so, but the panuchos were solid and the red snapper (with plantains) was absolutely terrific. The guava and cream cheese empanadas were a nice touch (I didn't know dessert empanadas were a thing).So why only three stars?Poor value. The portions are very small and quite pricy. The ceviche, which was mostly fruit with a dash of ahi, was $13. The two-bite panuchos were $16 (compare with tacos at OMG) and the wee bit o' snapper was $22 (compare with a whole fish at any Chinese restaurant).Poor service. They were pretty understaffed (there appeared to be one waitress on Friday at 9pm), and it took a long time to get her attention. And more time to get water and napkins. When we got the check, she had turned around and left before we could hand her our credit cards.The place is also crazy loud.

The guacamole is also great but.... the ""sauce"" is so bland. They do not have a spicy sauce at all. The sauce they serve taste more like tomato sauce than spicy at all but the reason I adore this restaurant is because I always ask for them to make me a dipping sauce that is spicy as I looove spicy food and they are always super accommodating will retry until they make something spicy enough to my liking.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,5307,"I've been looking for some good Mexican restaurant reasonably close to us in BK, and finally Leyanda came on top! We came here on an early Sunday night after drinks at Clover Club across the street. It wasn't busy when we walked in, but filled up nicely when we left. Excuse my lack of use of Spanish words, we got guacamole, goat and chicken tacos, some appetizer that's fried potatoes filled with ground beef, and pulled pork shoulders as entree. - Guacamole was nicely flavored, and my husband cannot stopped raving about their chips, which were crispy and freshly fried. Definitely not stale like our past few Mexican restaurants. - Both goat and chicken tacos were great. Flavors were well balanced, meat were juicy and tender. Absolutely no complaints. - Colombian papas rellenas, aka fried potatoes filled with ground beef was my second favorite of the night. It was not heavy like normal fried potatoes, instead, it was airy but full of flavors. I think it's their play on coquette, only better. - My favorite of the night, pulled pork shoulders, were simple but AMAZING. There's nothing fancy to this plate, just some old fashioned pulled pork shoulders, filled with flavors. We licked every bit of it from the plate. Ok, in addition to the food here, you have to try their drinks. The one drink I absolutely loved was Maiden Name, it literally tasted like a smoothie, with coconut, vanilla, cinnamon, and came with a flaming half lime on top that made the presentation on par with any other fancy speakeasy places I've been to.  Needless to say, I will be back.",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,9.89999961853,"restaurant,top,Leyanda,drinks,BK,appetizer,Mexican,street,drink,Clover Club,fried potatoes,chicken tacos,goat,use,lack,words,drinks,pork shoulders,guacamole,lime,fried potatoes,ground beef,restaurants,flavors,fried potatoes,chicken tacos,favorite,chips,ground beef,entree,husband,complaints,papas,play,coquette,Spanish,plate,Guacamole,food,addition,smoothie,coconut,Colombian,Flavors,top,goat,speakeasy places,par,presentation,cinnamon,vanilla,meat,Maiden Name,pork shoulders,flavors,pork shoulders,nothing,plate,bit,favorite","2,7,1,7,2,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,6,7,1","0.0982446521521,0.0982446521521,0.0567710697651,0.0517876595259,0.051347874105,0.0463034920394,0.0436244681478,0.0412898138165,0.0271340850741,0.0245161931962,0.0196982305497,0.0179211068898,0.0179211068898,0.0156843680888,0.0156843680888,0.0156843680888,0.0148419067264,0.0133093427867,0.0132287871093,0.0131980720907,0.0131559036672,0.0121071925387,0.0120452130213,0.0120259560645,0.0120259560645,0.0120217325166,0.011668395251,0.0116619542241,0.0109526785091,0.0105945300311,0.0105646383017,0.010486301966,0.0104723218828,0.00956187490374,0.00956187490374,0.00929302442819,0.00814302358776,0.00715117203072,0.0071191014722,0.0071191014722,0.00711363507435,0.00711363507435,0.00620220368728,0.00571866612881,0.0056299562566,0.00521022314206,0.00492574600503,0.00492574600503,0.00492574600503,0.00492574600503,0.00492574600503,0.00455075548962,0.00448749167845,0.00393517501652,0.00393147952855,0.00393147952855,0.00364247499965,0.00357575924136,0.00312559516169,0.00303517933935"

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,49015,"I am completely smitten with this place!I first became acquainted with Leyenda at Cocktail Magic (cocktailmagic.com/#/newy…) earlier this spring. My friends and I had the opportunity to sample a plethora of different cocktails from some of the biggest names around town, and one of Leyenda's drinks, La Sonámbula, was our hands down favorite of the night. After my experience there, I had it on my to-do list to visit the actual location.I've now been multiple times, and could not be more impressed. Absolutely love the space - the place is always abuzz, yet still feels intimate no matter whether you're seated at the bar, along the window, or at the tables. I could definitely see the place as a cute date spot. The cocktails here are all winners. My favorite as mentioned above, La Sonámbula, is excellent - comprised of ""Jalapeño infused blanco tequila, lemon, chamomile, mole & Peychaud's bitters."" It is just the perfect amount of spicy and sweet, and I always get at least one each time I come. The Tia Mia is also another favorite of mine. Food is surprisingly good - I always get the chips, salsa, and guacamole.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,30663,"I had bookmarked this place, recently opened on Smith St., to check out and see if I would be comfortable there when I'm out solo. Normally I might go to Bar Tabac or Los Lobos when I'm in Cobble Hill, but the other night it felt right to try Leyenda. Now it's potentially my new favorite spot.Walking into Leyenda, I knew I made the right choice in the moment. The place feels warm and inviting. A beautiful wooden bar on the left, complementary wood tables and benches on the right and in the back, overhead lighting mixed with votives on the tables and religious candles on an exposed brick wall...it all works together to say ""Welcome. Have a seat. You're going to like it here.""So I had a seat at the bar. The restaurant on a Thursday night was at the enjoyable equilibrium of being busy but not crowded. The bartender was the perfect mix of professional, friendly, and talented and made an excellent cocktail. (Rereading that last sentence, you'll have to forgive the ""perfect mix"" pun, because it turns out that the bartender was actually a co-owner and her name is Ivy Mix.) I sipped on my glass of deliciousness, relaxed, and waited for one of my best friends, who had decided to join me for a drink.I was hungry, so I ordered the Churrasco Skirt Steak. My friend showed up, sat down, was greeted by the bartender in that ""perfect mix"" kind of way, and then was served her own glass of deliciousness. (As an aside, if you sit at the bar, it becomes very clear very quickly why Ivy Mix is an award winning bartender.)  My steak came out fast, hot, and was presented simply. I'll admit my first thought was ""oh no, this is going to be the weak link"", but that thought was kicked to the curb because the steak was excellent, and a new thought entered my head: ""exactly what I wanted."" I offered a piece to my friend (who had said she wasn't hungry); ""ooh that IS good"" was followed by ""another piece please"".We stayed for a second drink and Ivy engaged us with fun and interesting conversation. My friend left before me, slightly and happily intoxicated. I lingered and chatted and finished my drink.

You won't find yourself looking at the menu perplexed by ingredients that you've never heard of, that's not what this bar is about. The food was delicious! we ordered several items and even ordered the pork shoulder twice!We were lucky enough to catch Ivy behind the bar. She was a wonderful host and along with the rest of her staff, absolutely made the experience for us.

I've never been the biggest fan of Mofongo, as it's typically too dry for my liking, but Leyenda's take on it was moist, flavorful, and the perfect accompaniment for the Pernil.The two standouts were the Churrasco Skirt Steak and the Ceviche.Easily one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Seasoned and cooked perfectly, it was melt in your mouth good, and still has me craving another piece two days later.The Ceviche was a much different twist than I'm used to, what with apple, ginger and pomegranate added to the mix, but it surprisingly all worked together to create a fresh, vibrant and flavorful dish.

However, since it was comfortably busy when I was there on a Thursday night I guess the secret is out and it wouldn't do any good any way. So....in the interest of being honest and forthright let me tell you the following:1. Every dam thing is delicious2. It doesn't make a big deal of it but the menu has fantastic vegetarian options3. The drinks are ERRTHING (I'm personally a fan of the Feeling Catcher but you should do you, can't go wrong)4. I just left and I'm ready to turn this cab around and go back to lick my plate. My sister and I had guacamole (delish), tamal (unctuously creamy and amazing), papusas (two words: pickled slaw. Also, whatever that tomato relish is underneath I'd like a jar), empanadas (more please) and  Bibb salad with cashews and hearts of palm (speaks for itself). Basically the environment is just right for friends or lovers; the menu offers truly well crafted and yummy food for carnivores and vegetarians; the cocktails are appropriately complex yet easy to enjoy; and finally, don't come here cause you'll tell your friends and they'll tell their friends and it will be ruined for us all.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,64,"Once upon a time, my slightly drunken but always classy wife texted me, ""Come meet us! We're at Leyenday!""Well, that was a somewhat prophetic typo because that evening, and all other subsequent Smith Street evenings at this fine establishment, have combined 'Leyenda' with 'Yay!' Because this joint kicks ass. To elaborate on that, here is a short list of Things I've Never Had At Leyenda:1. A bad cocktail. From the nearly always appropriate Sonambula to the very boozy Cabezaso or the mezcal-based Lil' Smokey (perhaps my favorite so far), the cocteles are impeccable. The 'Dem Apples is a nice seasonal one, if you're into that. Try a mezcal flight if nothing appeals to you, and expand your mind, man.2. Bad service. The bartenders (including Ivy Mix, somewhat of a celebrity in the world of alcohol) don't just know their biz, they offer up genuinely friendly smiles that are only outdone by the adorable sweetheart who was running food this past Tuesday evening. She was more excited than I was about the tinga tacos I was getting, which is quite frankly, incredible.3. My appendix out. I don't think they offer that service here. 4. Anything half-assed. Thought and care has gone into every aspect of this place, and I appreciate it. The effect of the candlelight reflecting off the gorgeous golden ceiling makes me want to sit in my seat and sip mezcal forever. Not even the garnishes are afterthoughts, but rather careful additions (candied ginger, dried apples, cooked pineapple) that add a little more complexity to already deliciously complex drinks.5. Bad food. The plates are beautiful and for the most part, very tasty, Pupusas, flautas, arepas, empanadas...all damn good accompaniment to the booze, which is the star of the show in this particular establishment. I imagine the croquetas are good as well, as it seems that I like anything that ends in ""as."" I have yet to make a decision about the panuchos or the rellenos.

I actually looked forward coming here because of all the high reviews so I was shocked by my experience.The drinks were definitely strong I'll give them that! But a strong drink doesn't mean it tastes good. Maybe 10 years ago in my twenties, I would have loved getting such a strong ass drink so I can get a good buzz going without using up my paycheck. The food reminds me of bar food, more for soaking up alcohol in your stomach and not so much for the food experience. We had the Guac with chips, Pupusas, Pescadilla, Pernil & Mofongo and chicken tinga tacos. The Guac was small and pretty tasteless, it needed more salt and cilantro. Not worth $10. The Pupusas was bland as well. I wasn't quite sure what I was eating. Pescadilla was okay. Mofongo was so dry and tough. I took 2 bites. The chicken tinga tacos were ok, needed more spice and why was it so wet?PRO:The happy hour drinks are a good deal and very reasonably priced.

We had to improvise a place to set aside our jackets and my girlfriends purse, which can be difficult since this place can get crowded. Overall though we loved our meal and had a nice buzz from our two cocktails.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,198017,Leyenda was a rough experience. Small drinks with high prices. The food was more Pan Spanish then it was specific to one country though it leaned Mexican. However being a proud Hispanic I was highly confused by the lack of rice or rice and beans in any form. In fact it was lacking in any carbohydrate. Might be what some select few might like but I like a complete meal. The steak was spiced really well. The spacing  as also a let down both the waitress and other people near me would bump into me as I was eating my meal. Lack of personal space and being bumped into while I'm eating is not cool at all.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,14020,"Oh Leyenda how you have completely destroyed  my liver and wallet. Dammit, I thought I was completely happy with what I thought were stellar cocktails at Maison Premiere and June, yet somehow, after discovering you (and having to see you 5 times in one week) I figured I could still go back to my old standbys for impressive drinks and would still be satisfied.  Oh, hell no.  June seriously tasted like I had gone from Pliny the Younger to Keystone Light, and Maison Premiere was just plain terrible. I used to be fooled by Maison Premieres Disneyland theatrics but last week I went and after Leyenda and my wife and I both felt like we were drinking crappy liquor smothered with fancy flowers. Leyenda on otherhand just focuses on the craft of the cocktail and uses some crazy good ingredients. No attitude, no judgement, no fake theatrics....just insanely good cocktails.  Yes, I will admit being a 6'-5 guy it can feel a bit strange ordering a drink that is topped with flowers and other less than manly decorations, but dammit are these drinks strong,and unlike other places, all these toppings are just pretty decorations but play into the flavor of the drink. Everything is just perfectly balanced. Yes, I realize this is a spinoff of Clover Club, but it is so many levels better than Clover.  I have lived in this hood for 14 years and while I love Clover club for the drinks (although sadly their best drink, the triboro, is long gone), the fake new Irish pub plasticy woodwork is just distracting. It just doesn't work and then pair with the weird fake handlebar mustached 1920s actor/bouncer at the door and I just gave up on them (despite greatly respecting their cocktails). Leyenda is different.  This spot had a series of failed restaurants and rather than gutting the place they kept the facade and then added in a few knickknacks to give character yet not feel pretentious. Okay so I realize I am not listing specific drinks, even though I have had them all, but I have to say you can't go wrong. Just talk to the bartender and go with what you like. Surprisingly, I found the rum based drinks my least favorite. The tequila ones really rock. Their signature Tia Mia is phenomenal. The bartenders are really great. We have spent the most time with Amanda but Brian rocked it tonight. We finally made it to the happy hour and plowed through whole menu (hard to resist $6 cocktails of this caliber).  The Chilcano was my favorite although I never made it to the Michelado which looks insanely good. So the food is really solid but it is mostly small plates.

Though I expected it, given the background and pedigree of Ivy Mix, the owner, I was still impressed. I started with La Sonambula, which is a spicy jalapeno-infused drink, and then switched to Lil Smokey, which was a delicious infusion of smoke and sweetness. My friend and I split an order of guacamole and I ordered the Fautas. The guac was fantastic (and a pretty generous portion) but unfortunately the Fautas were only average - they sort of reminded me of microwaved taquitos.

Leyenda,5510,221 Smith St,Brooklyn,11201.0,116152,"I've been to Leyenda for drinks, which are great....you would expect that as the owner also owns Clover Club across the street. Today I went for brunch. First warning bell was that the place was empty at about 12.15. Not one single person. I ordered the hangar steak with two eggs - mine were scrambled. My better half ordered the same with eggs over easy. The waitress was very pleasant and the decor is cute. I wish I could say the same for the food. When our dishes arrived the steak (and my scrambled eggs) were swimming in a pool of oil.  The steak comes with a chimichurri sauce, most likely the source of the oil. My partners eggs were over done, the waitress was observant and proactive in re-doing them when she saw him separating the yolks from the whites in the oil slick. In a way the overdone eggs were a fluke for my partner as I'm not sure how he would have eaten his eggs if they hadn't been redone on a separate dish - the yolks would have broken right into the oil otherwise. I ate my meal as quickly as I could. Both the eggs and steak were very tasty, but if either had gotten cold in the oil bath I wouldn't have been able to go any further. To Leyenda's credit when the waitress checked in with us and we told her not all was right, she removed the charge off our bill. I'm writing this review with the hope that the owner or manager  sees it and reviews this menu item. I can see from previous reviews that they seem to be quite responsive.

It's real, it's cheap, and it's a treat if you know where to look. And in the case of Lhasa Fast Food, you better have 20/20 vision because it's really, really hard to find. In fact, it's so hard to find, you'll have to strut to the back of this mobile phone store (yelp.com/biz/tibet-mobil…) where Lhasa has a small kitchen in what looks to be an unused storage area in the back. If this were Manhattan, you'd chalk up a soup dumpling counter in the back of a cell phone store as a clever gimmick to attract as many Warby Parker wearing hipsters as possible (think PDT inside of Crif Dogs). Here at Tibet Mobile/Lhasa Fast Food, it's clear these are just hard working immigrants trying to make an honest living in the most cost effective way they know how. It's a real American dream happening in front of your eyes and it's an amazing experience to behold.As for the momos, they're right up there with the best I've tasted. They come with six total and they're served fresh and piping hot. Filled with an herb-intoxicating chunk of ground beef and the perfect amount of savory broth, it's a tasty little bite that'll satisfy any soup dumpling fanatic.

M, and 7 trains... so whether you're on the way home and craving a quick nibble or you're willing to travel the 20 minutes it takes to get there on the subway from Lower Manhattan, you really should bookmark this spot and give it a go.

If you're not familiar with momos, they're a thicker skinned dumpling filled in this case with perfectly spiced beef and a slight bit of meat juices. They were the highlight of our meal here. They only cost $6 for an order of 8 or so (I think). We got two orders to share amongst the three of us. The Tibet noodle and phinsa were good as well but not as excellent as the momos. The Tibetan tea is a nice beverage to warm you up, but if you haven't had it before you should know it mostly tastes like butter and milk, not like any other tea I've ever had.

We also had the Tibetan noodle soup both days.  The broth alone makes it wonderful--so much flavor all by itself.  The chopped beef, noodles and vegetables are perfectly cooked and complement the broth--and vice versa.Both dishes were served fresh and piping hot!And the Tibetan butter tea is just the piece de resistance!Be aware, if you are driving, that there is only metered street parking so bring quarters, and it's a busy area so you may need to drive around for a while.  Also, watch the no parking signs very carefully!There is a TV playing Tibetan music videos.CASH ONLY",5.0 star rating,"Flushing, NY",2,0,0.5,7.59999990463,"location,place,halves,electronics store,end,hall,door,right,butter tea,granddaughter,family style,street parking,end,jewelry store,halves,tables,staircase,size,garage,person,boyfriend,beef,beef,table,momos,Lhasa Fast Food,momo,Tibetan,wonders,issues.,dumpling,waitress,juice,chive interiors,taste,chicken,meatballs,flavor,resistance,vice,dishes,TV,parking signs,area,music,quarters,beef,broth,broth,noodles,noodle soup,vegetables,CASH","2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,1,7,4,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0915888771415,0.0743699595332,0.0501853339374,0.0501853339374,0.0501853339374,0.0439634881914,0.0439634881914,0.0439634881914,0.0389954559505,0.0369189791381,0.0332881063223,0.0210735090077,0.0192656442523,0.0192656442523,0.0192656442523,0.0191672015935,0.0168625321239,0.0167763233185,0.0167763233185,0.0134438415989,0.0133123621345,0.0128917219117,0.0128917219117,0.0128683755174,0.0123890526593,0.0122369360179,0.0117503954098,0.0117227854207,0.0112930638716,0.0112612135708,0.0112612135708,0.0112612135708,0.0102825397626,0.0102624930441,0.0102624930441,0.0102624930441,0.00961669906974,0.00853555742651,0.00762554910034,0.00762554910034,0.00762554910034,0.00646048365161,0.00646048365161,0.00528064649552,0.00527482619509,0.00453555490822,0.00420453818515,0.00412640115246,0.00382878584787,0.00382416206412,0.00335423019715,0.00334570650011,0.00256070005707"

It's definitely a great place, and has that speakeasy feel which New Yorkers love to experience, and really it's just a humble little restaurant. It's so humble that dishes are cooked one at a time and they use a hot plate to make everything because they don't have gas. So I would like to temper the series of 5 star reviews by saying that service can take quite a while; you must be patient to come here.

They have the structure and thickness of a heavy little meat packed momo with the delicious soup-like juicyness of a soup dumping. I am also pretty sure they make everything here to order. Everyone's momos were coming out piping hot and fresh and I was creepily watching them roll out the dough while I waited. This might be my champion for momo in Queens.But wait, there's more... the minced beef noodle soup ($6) is packed full of awesome vegetables that are really the perfect mix of crunchy and soft in a tasty broth.

There is a small door on the right which looks like the Cell phone store's backroom and one you go through that, lo-and-behold, you are in a sort-of momo speakeasy!There is just one guy who is cooking, cleaning, waiting and collecting cash from you so be patient. A small handwritten menu sits on one wall, of which most of the items are completely foreign unless you know Himalayan/Nepalese food. We knew what momos and soup dumplings were so we got both.There are two types of delicious tea they serve before the meal. One is a ginger-milk tea, served warm with sugar added. The other is a savory broth-type tea filled with flavor we could not pinpoint. Both were delicious.The momos were out-of-this-world. The juicy, beefy inside has a much higher meat to veggie ratio than other potsticker variants. The outside was perfectly steamed and (obviously) not too greasy due to not being fried. The soup dumplings were just as good as the momos, but the broth they were in was amazing. We emptied the broth from the bowl into cups so we could drink it all up.

As a newbie falling into the hype of the secretive location I'd say the dumplings are the main attraction. Their shape and size are comparable to the soup dumplings but Tibetan variety has a thicker skin and has more meat filling options like beef or chicken. I ordered the dumplings in soup for $7. The soup was barely seasoned but was chock full of herbs and chili oil and pairs well with salty meat filling in the dumplings. The place is tiny with 5 or so tables. I wish I'd tried more dishes but was full from a previous meal. The staff are really friendly.

Look for the address first, then follow the directions. Definitely worth the search. I know nothing about Nepalese food, so cannot compare to other Nepalese restaurants, but I will say the food was delicious! We had an order of the beef & chive momos and the chili fried beef. The momos are large and succulent. I was worried that the fried beef might be too spicy, but it was just right. If you don't like spicy food, you might want to steer clear, but as long as you can handle a little heat, this is a winner. Beef was tender and just the right amount of spice.

Pretty sure everyone in the shop is so used to seeing people looking lost and confused and directing them to the back because the first thing they asked me as I looked back at my phone was ""lhasa?? ::and points::"" Seating is scarce so you might have to wait a bit - I'd say it sits at most 15 people but it's cramped as heck. The shop is run by two people who work surprisingly fast. Menu is simple consisting of only a handful of items. We got the beef momo and phinsha. This was my first time trying momo's so I wasn't really sure what to expect but these soup dumplings were really good and FRESH so be careful (no matter how many times I've eaten soup dumplings I will always burn my tongue on the first one -.-).. it's hot. Compared to the other momo trucks we tried (including an award winning one), the beef in these momo's are a lot more seasoned and moist. There's a hot sauce that gets passed around that you can use to add some heat to it. The phinsha was not as spicy as I expected it to be - it just looked so red and reminded me of tomyum soup - but that's ok because I was sweating in there. It's tasty with only enough spice to give it a kick. They also serve free himalayan(?) tea, also called butter tea, which consists of tea, butter and salt. I love all kinds of tea but I couldn't get past the saltiness of it, was only able to handle a few sips.

It was really helpful watching the episode as it helped me find this place and introduced items for me to order.The entrance is a bit obscure because there is no sign directing you to this place. There is only a piece of paper taped on a door to lead you to this place. You enter through the cell phone shop, but DO NOT walk down the stairs. Instead, walk straight to the back and you will have found this hidden gem. It's a bit confusing once you get in because there is no counter to order and no one seating you at the tables. I was confused on what to do so I followed other people's lead and sat myself down. There are only six small tables, so you might have to wait for seats. My party ordered the beef momos and the momos in soup. The momos are similar to the Chinese soup dumplings, except that the skin is much thicker and there is much more meat. The beef momos were so tasty. The beef was so flavorful, tender and juicy. There is only just a bit of soup that is inside the dumpling, but it was still so good. The hot sauce they have is a perfect complement to the momos! The momos in soup were also good. The momos were the same beef momos and the soup was a spicy clear broth with red oil on top. I really enjoyed the soup because it was reminiscent of a Sichuan flavor.Overall, food was fresh and delicious! But what really makes this place is the friendly staff. They are nice and will help you through the menu. Also, when you are finished, you just tell the staff what you had and pay in cash. So the staff really trust the customers and go on an honor system.

But I did know to ask for momos (momoes?) thanks to my prior experience at another Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant (Yak n Yeti in New Cumberland, PA).  At the time they only had Beef and Chive momos ($6 per 8) so I asked for 2 orders to go.  I wouldn't know anything else to order.No one was ahead of me, but the wait time seemed like forever.  I think I must have waited for a good 20-25 minutes. For a while I wasn't so sure if they took my order due to possible communication problem, not!  They told me it takes 12 minutes just to steam the momos. And I figure they have to wrap them fresh by hand as well.  So you can see that: 1) it's a good thing that you're waiting because it's for a good reason :)  2) during peak time you can expect Holland Tunnel kind of congestion :(So a good tip is to call ahead with your order!  That's what I'll do next time.  Also, per the owner, their Facebook page has menu info (sorry I don't facebook so I didn't verify that). Oh, AND the English menus should be coming SOON.The momos I had today was a bit too salty per my liking, but still tasted quite good.  If you had steamed chive dim sum before and you liked it, then you're in for a treat.  Over all, I was thinking 3.5 stars, but for their friendly manners and for the near-overseas experience without getting on a plane, I bumped it up to 4.",4.0 star rating,"Mechanicsburg, PA",2,1,0.20000000298,10.1000003815,"candidate,eatery,thing,stop,episode,place,Amazing Race,address,word,ARROW,menu,Lhasa,English,momos,momoes,menu,experience,luggage store,restaurant,thanks,momos,order,sum,momos,orders,anything,stars,momos,Beef,communication problem,menus,hand,reason,Chinese,Himalayan,Nepalese,Chive,liking,Yak n Yeti,New Cumberland,PA,experience,treat,plane,manners,SOON.,order,tip,page,kind,congestion,menu info,owner,Facebook,Holland Tunnel","1,3,7,2,5,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2","0.088212326169,0.088212326169,0.0795357003808,0.0722570791841,0.0722570791841,0.0543905384839,0.0430312715471,0.0345948375762,0.0344186238945,0.0344186238945,0.0212644413114,0.0204287227243,0.0195419508964,0.0188481472433,0.0188481472433,0.0178167391568,0.0149654811248,0.013181919232,0.0130969928578,0.0130969928578,0.0126701686531,0.0122062638402,0.0117734596133,0.0115212639794,0.0110875694081,0.0105166453868,0.0104981372133,0.0102196410298,0.00882541481405,0.00878021121025,0.00806055683643,0.00801485683769,0.00800602789968,0.00780928507447,0.00775891449302,0.00775891449302,0.00597345316783,0.0059604155831,0.0052384682931,0.0052384682931,0.0052384682931,0.00471007591113,0.00412385165691,0.00412086443976,0.00412086443976,0.00352884316817,0.00329447258264,0.00321108615026,0.00312499934807,0.00301381573081,0.00262141157873,0.00261665857397,0.00261665857397,0.00177030812483,0.00155154033564"

I can't imagine myself finding this nifty establishment unless I watched the eater video on it. The Tibetan culture is especially made apparent by the large Dalai Lama picture along with the fact that the... shopping center? Is rather Tibetan in nature. A site that I myself have never seen prior to visiting this place. Because of that fact alone it's already pouring culture out it's sides. So the momos, that's the thing that people will often come here for. I haven't had momos previously but I did come with someone who did. Having seated myself next to a Caucasian couple who seemed to worship the food like a professional wine taster it's safe to say my expectations were set even a bit higher. Just like that couple I ordered myself the beef and chive momos along with the Then Thuk and Glass Noodles with Beef.The chive and beef momos are overwhelmingly chive which is something I don't mind but if you didn't tell me that it's chive AND beef I wouldn't have been able to tell. It was quite similiar to a boiled (if you are familiar with dim sum) chive dumpling. The sauces offered provide a nice change to flavor. The orange one offering a unique spice coupled with the black vinegar. The Then Thuk on the other hand was really hearty soul food; surprisngly filling. The Glass Noodles with Beef despite it's intimidating red appearance was actually quite mild and contained a type of beef heavily resembling char siu. (chinese bbq pork)Now you may have noticed that I haven't really raved about the food, and that's the only problem here. To a more trained pallet I just didn't find the food to be that great. Although it offered flavors and textures that I wasn't used to I could tell that it could be done better, that doesn't mean it was bad though.So in a nutshell it's a rather nice place.

Nothing is better than an affordable food while it tasted good.  Momo is a Nepalese dumpling similar to Chinese soup dumping. This is the kind of quick serve restaurant I would like to explore on whatever they have on the menu. Why? Well because it is cheap, just kidding. Because they are usually small and serve only limited kind of foods that is more authentic than those fancy restaurants (obviously not all of them are). I went in and saw almost all the table are full (they only got five tables). Luckily, there was an empty tiny table that only fit one or two people. To order, it requires one to go up to the counter and tell them what you want to order. I ordered the chives and beef momo($6), beef momo($6), Tibetan noodle($6) and liang-fen($7). The person in front of me pour himself a cup of milk tea like drink from the container in front of the counter. I as well followed his step after I placed my order. This is definitely milk tea but it was salty! The Chinese kind of milk tea is sweet so it is really weird because I have never tasted a salted milk tea until now. It is free so do not worry about trying it. The Tibetan noodle has ground beef and strong soup(a little salty). This is not my favorite food here but it still tasted pretty good. After 15 minutes, the chives and beef momo finally came. I took a bite and I felt like there were too much chives and not enough beef. It was disappointment so I ordered another beef only momo. The beef momo tasted great with strong beef flavor with good texture on the outside. The momo took forever so you should place the order as soon as possible. Last, the liang-fen which comes in either sushi liang-fen or regular liang-fen. The only difference between them is regular liang-fen are chop up and comes in a small bowl and the other one is roll up like a sushi. This dish is extremely spicy so I recommend you asked for less spicy but if you can take the spicy then go ahead. Other than that, it was the best compare to the rest.

You have to walk into a cellphone store, go straight and you will see steps leading into the basement. DO NOT walk down to the basement, turn right instead and walk through another glass door. You will see a lot of local people in this tiny restaurant (5 tables, about 15 seats). I was really confused as to what to order, luckily there are pictures on the wall. The menu in the front is in another language, but the one in the back has English. We ordered with the lady at the counter (if you're staying, order first and pay after you finish eating). After ordering, we saw two hot mugs and foam cups and plates in front of the counter. Just grab a cup and help yourself to whatever is in the mug (some kind of weird salted milk tea). Grab some plates to put your food in when it comes. The food came out slow. 15 minutes wait for the first dish, then one after another after we finish the first. Here's what we got:1. Beef and chives mono $6 : momo skin was very chewy, the filling consist of mostly chives with tiny tiny pieces of ground beef. It's nothing special, similar to a Chinese chives with pork dumpling. 2. Beef momo $6: the filling is a large chunk of ground beef, very flavorful, I can taste a lot of  herbs and spices in there. I would definitely recommend getting this instead of chives and beef.3. Tibetan noodle $6: noodle with ground beef, carrots, onion, spinach, cilantro... the soup was good, a bit of sweet and sour... the noodle tasted over cooked and not enough beef... would not recommend this.4. Sushi liang-fen $7 (spicy cold mung bean noodle):  this is rly rly rly spicy but still tasty... ask for less spicy! We didn't know until we tried it, took a bite and took the rest to go.. definitely go for it if you love super spicy food!

My goal is to try to find the best dumplings and hope to share with you. Please also read my other review on Shanghai dumplings in Fort Lee, NJI stopped by because of all the good reviews. Took the E train down to Roosevelt Ave, walked 2 blocks. I ordered carry out (Momos: 1 chive, 1 beef, 1 chicken), which took about 15-20 mins to prepare. At 3:30 PM, they had 4 tables of diners. They had a table available for me to wait, so I just watched their Tibetan music videos, which showed the country side, their way of life, the musical instruments, the traditional dress; it really portrayed the emphasis of the Silk Road. On yelp, it states they do not take credit card, so I made sure I had cash. Each order was $6 for 8 dumplings. Total $18 (!!!; I had to check and ask again ""no tax?), so I gave them $20- $2 for tip. They are friendly and helpful. I schlepped the dumplings on the train back to Jersey. I was so tempted to try a bite on the train! Even after an hour or so, they were still warm. The momos were big, 2 biters, or 1 mouthful bite. (See my photo). The dough was perfect, tender and a little chewy; content still had some juice. The chicken and beef were nicely spiced. Beware, there was some small bones in the chicken momos. The accompanying spicy sauce added more flavor to the chive momos. At home, I also made a soy, ginger, & vinegar sauce to add a different taste. Between the 2 of us, we could not finish all, with at least 8 dumplings left.Husband & I really loved it.

Well, the reason - is you will need walk through few cell phone stores and a jewelry store to reach this gem of a place. This place is tiny - only about 10-15 seatings if I have to guess.

Tucked away behind a mobile shop, Lhasa Fast Food is one of those true underground (""speakeasy"" for all you bougie people) places that makes Queens so mysterious yet so charming, but the secret's out about this place.I had a good experience my first time with the beef and chives momos that I brought a friend here on a Tuesday night and it was SO packed, you would've thought it was a weekend. We made 3 orders and during the two hours we were here, only two of the orders came, with about 30 minutes apart from each other. The service and the food was just so lackluster--they didn't get give us one of our orders and I think either they did it intentionally, because they didn't write it down on the check, or they honestly didn't write it down. On top of that, the food was really bad. The momos were dry as if they premade them and recooked them out from the freezer. Either way, it was a really disappointing experience, especially since I introduced my friend to this place after raving about it all the time.Maybe I really came here on a bad day and it was hectic in the kitchen, but it's no reason to compromise quality and customer service. If you do come here on a good day, though, the momos aren't bad. Don't expect them to taste like xiao long baos--the juice is thicker and more rich, IMO.

But some necessary warnings: this place is difficult to find - it's in a mini-mall, behind an electronics store in the back - and contrary to its name, it took a while for us to get our food. (Think 20-30 minutes.) It's also a place just for a quick meal, not for atmosphere or service. If that's all ok with you, then you're in for a treat.We ordered Tibetan noodles, phinsha (kind of like Vietnamese pho), and momos. Both noodle dishes were hot, filling, and filled with flavor and fresh ingredients. I'm not even a soup person, but they were a perfect antidote for a winter day. But the momos, they were excellent! Imagine dumplings with well-seasoned meat, then pair it with a spicy red sauce. Wow! They were tasty, well-crafted (e.g., the folds of the dumpling), and juicy, which is too rare among dumplings.

My friends and I were walking down the road looking for a sign and a storefront, though my friend finally said that was it was hidden behind a mobile (think cell phones) store. With the help of GPS, we ended up in front of a mobile store, still confused on the location of the restaurant. I see a small sign on the window and knew, that this was the random door way to lead us to lunch time goodness. We walk in and see two out of the 5 tables had diners. The menu was compact, and that's what I love to see, quality on few dishes rather than a grandeur menu that lacks the most important aspect, good taste. As two of us had never tried Tibetan food before, we weren't sure what to order, so our Tibetan friend said that we would probably enjoy the noodle soup... and she ordered momo, which are dumplings.- Noodle soup consisted of halal beef, daikon, and I forgot what else; but I do have a picture of it served into a smaller bowl.- Momo I believe has beef as well, it was juicy though I wouldn't consider it a soup dumpling.Both were very good.

Lhasa Fast Food,5512,37-50 74th StSte 3750,Jackson Heights,11372.0,14616,"Lives up to the hype. Lhasa Fast Food is definitely one of the best spots for Tibetan food in the area, and that's saying something, because there are several other great options available. The space is humble and utilitarian. High on the main wall is a portrait of the Dalai Lama. There are only a handful of tables, so you may be asked to share half of a table with another couple/group. We ordered the thenthuk, the glass noodles with beef, and the chive and beef momo. They were all delicious, but the thenthuk and the momo were my favorites. The thenthuk is a mild-tasting soup with vegetables, slices of beef, wood ear (don't be afraid, it's a mushroom that is commonly used in Asian cuisines), and hand-torn noodles. The noodles were astonishingly good. They were strong enough to hold their structure despite the temperature of the soup, and remain chewy. The chive and beef momo reminded me of the chive pancakes that you can get on the street in Korea and Taiwan. They were filled mostly with chives, cooked enough that they release their trademark flavor. Note that the food is extremely hot. (Temperature-wise I mean, but there's also hot pepper paste in case you want that too.) We went on a pretty mild summer day, and it's not terribly hot inside the restaurant, but after I had a few spoonfuls of the soup, my shirt was completely drenched. We regretted not bringing hand towels with us. Instead, we relied on paper napkins to wipe our faces, so that we could keep our sweat from dripping onto the food. So until autumn, I'll probably be sticking to the momos and stir-fried noodles. If you like this place, be sure to also check out Tawa Food, which is just a couple of blocks away.

When I finally found the restaurant, I immediately felt a sense of authenticity attached to the atmosphere. Whether it be the Tibetan music videos or the large picture of the Dalai Lama, there was a certain charm to it. I ordered the beef and chive momos (8 buns for $6) and beef minced noodle soup ($6). The beef and chive momos were really good. They came out hot and steamy. It had a juicy/soupy filling alongside the beef and chives. The dough on the outer layer was thick, which I personally liked since it made it easier to handle (since they were hot!). I can see why it is the most popular dish on the menu. The beef minced noodle soup was average. The flavor of the broth and noodles were somewhat bland. There was little beef in the soup. A positive aspect of it however, was the generous amount of noodles that were given. There was also free milk tea available in the front. It was sweet and smooth. I thoroughly enjoyed the beverage, especially I came in on a cold and rainy day. A criticism I do have of the place is that it did not feel clean. There was some leftover food on some of the utensils and the tables were a bit sticky. Also, there is limited seating.But this shouldn't drive you away from the place.

I had to visit to try the dishes that looked so delicious.  It was my first time venturing into Jackson Heights.  The restaurant is located right by the 74st Jackson Heights subways station. (Bf drove to Queens, we did not take the subway).Do not walk downstairs into the luggage shop.  The nice people there pointed us back upstairs.  (They're probably used to lost and confused looking people wandering into their shop). There's a door to the right, next to the stairs where you enter into the cell phone shop and proceed to walk down the hallway to Lhasa.Though it's called Lhasa fast food, the food doesn't actually come out quickly.  It seemed like it is made fresh, per order, so be prepared to wait 10-15mins for your first dish.Beef momo $6 for 8pcs - as others have said, they look like a larger, more doughy version of Shanghai soup dumplings.  The flavor was very gamey to me, with some herb seasoning.  It was interesting.  Was mostly meat and had a bit of soup/juice inside.Soup dumplings $7 - this was essentially the momo in broth.  Still good, just not what I was expecting.  The broth was good, had clear noodles with scallions and spinach in it.  Not spicy.Phinsha $6 - beef slices with clear noodles, firm tofu, wood mushroom in a super spicy broth.  This was super spicy.  It tasted very good, but I only had a little bit of broth and noodles before I gave up. There was a layer of red spicy oil at the top of the bowl.  This is good for people who can really take the heat, aka my bf.The milk tea is off to the side.  The ginger milk tea was good, just not enough ginger flavor for me.

Lhasa Fast Food,5512,37-50 74th StSte 3750,Jackson Heights,11372.0,12508,"Lhasa Fast Food is a little hard to find.. They recently put out a neon green posterboard that says ""Lhasa Fast Food"" with a little arrow pointing inside. Once you're inside there's a cell phone store to your right, a little shop that sells luggage downstairs, and if you go a bit further pass the cell phone store, there's a small jewelry shop to your left and right in front of you will be the small restaurant.Their momos are off the hook. The dough is a little too thick for my liking (the momo truck, AMDO Kitchen, has beef momos with thinner skins) but I love the beef and chive combo - it's so juicy. They also have black vinegar on hand which is usually a shanghai soup dumpling condiment. I tried their noodle soup with momos and it is freaking spicy.

I loved the chili pepper flakes and vinegar mix to dip it in. The beef/chives, is more chives than beef, but it's great because it adds that other level of flavor from Chinese chives. Overall, the place is low key, homey, and hole in the wall good. There's not much service, but you're not there to wine and dine either.

Lhasa Liang Fen,5513,81-15 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,46064,"I have this natural gravitation towards momos.  I have always liked the idea of a juicy meat filled dumpling (i.e. Buhkarian Samcys, Shanghai style soup dumplings), and as such I really enjoy my first encounters with momos.   (the Potala momo truck in Jackson Heights) - it was a cold January evening about 10 years ago, served on a Styrofoam plate with chile sauce, some type of yogurt sauce, and a strofoam cup filled with steaming broth.  It was meaty (roughly chopped), juicy, and totally what was needed.  Add a cup of butter tea and it was winter perfection.  As the number of Tibetan/Nepali immigrants steadily rose and more joints open up, there are more encounters with Tibetan cuisine..  A steaming bowl of chicken thentuk at Namaste Tashi Dalek, a nice thali at Mustang Thakali, a curry rice over at Friends place.  The number of joints in Elmhurst serving Tibetan goes from zero to one, then back to zero again (the place that took over the old Lao Beifang noodle house on Whitney lasted about as long as the Thai dessert place that came after it).  Well, it is surprising that not only one place popped up in the past few months, but two.  One is a 3 table hole-in-the-ground with a simple menu, and the other is a full sitdown experience, and they are right next to each other.  This review is for the former.The use of the term ""liangfen"" is informative about the owner of the place - liangfen is  凉粉, a savory mungbean jelly product from Western China (those from Southern China or Hong Kong will note that 凉粉 in their context is grass jelly, an herbal dessert served sweetened).  It's not the same as the Northern liangpi, or 凉皮, which is savory and made with rice flour.  In Tibet the product is known as Laphing.  So, why the use of Mandarin Chinese to denote a Tibetan product?  Well, several theories -A) Elmhurst is a Chinatown, and referring to it using a Chinese name attracts Chinese customers (but then, the name isn't written in Chinese).B) The owner is a sinicized Tibetan from Lhasa (totally possible)Considering that a sizable chunk of the Tibetan restaurants in New York trace their roots to the exiled diaspora with roots to  India, they naturally associate with deferences to Indian/Nepali cuisine (and if you look hard enough, Tibetan independence flags and the Dalai Llama's portrait is found somewhere).  Here, the flavors and menus swing towards Beijing, and I suspect the TV is tuned to CCTV Lhasa.  Okay, politics aside, how was the experience?  The dining area is perennially crowded (what do you expect out of a tight dining area) and the service is curt but courteous. Flavors?  Pretty good.  The momos were a bit on the mushy side but still servicible.  The included hot sauce is less diverse than their JaHe cousins (they typically have 2 types of hot + a pepper infused soy sauce).  The thenthuks were okay but not as good as the one at Mustang Thakali or Tashi Dalek.  The magic therefore lays in the namesake Laphing.Okay. So what is Laphing like?  Cool soft savory jelly with a spicy soy vinegar dressing with hot oil, chopped scallions, flakes of pepper and garlic, and sometimes a bit of peanuts and crispy gluten.   In this instance, salty, spicy, vinegary, savory and rather satisfying.  In terms of a street snack it's top-of-the-line.  Now imagine the same family of flavors, except applied on noodles with chopped meat and yellow noodles, and that's your Dan-Dan noodles.  The soup noodles are okay, but nothing extraordinary.Overall, a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Certainly hope that they stick around.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",4,0,0.20000000298,16.2999992371,"momo truck,momos,place,gravitation,sitdown experience,momos,yogurt sauce,chile sauce,Northern liangpi,Tibetan,dumpling,meat,soup dumplings,type,strofoam cup,encounters,joints,dessert place,Styrofoam plate,broth,idea,number,Namaste Tashi Dalek,Shanghai,Buhkarian Samcys,Potala,Jackson Heights,restaurants,place,Elmhurst,cup,number,cuisine,chicken thentuk,curry rice,joints,name,encounters,winter perfection,grass jelly,place - liangfen,butter tea,immigrants,bowl,thali,Nepali,place,Laphing.Okay,use,owner,liangfen,mungbean jelly product,product,review,Tibetan,name,product,menu,each other,term,owner,dessert,same,use,hot sauce,noodle house,roots,cuisine,roots,Mustang Thakali,former.,context,rice flour,soy sauce,one,theories,customers,deferences,chunk,diaspora,Chinatown,Friends,jelly,Chinese,Southern China,Western China,types,pepper,Mandarin Chinese,side,cousins,magic,oil,flakes,garlic,scallions,soy vinegar,noodles,noodles,noodles,soup noodles,Thai,Whitney,Lao Beifang,Hong Kong,flavors,Lhasa,B),New York,Indian,bit,terms,meat,peanuts,gluten,instance,street snack,family,nothing,neighborhood,JaHe,flavors,Flavors,service,experience,somewhere,menus,dining area,dining area,bit,thenthuks,Dan-Dan,independence flags,portrait,swing,TV,politics,addition,Dalai Llama,Beijing,CCTV,momos","6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,3,2,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,6,7,7,1,6,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,6,6,5,7,7,6,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,2,3,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,1,1,2,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,7,1,1,7,5,7,7,7,7,1,2,3,7","0.0493563711643,0.0465904250741,0.0428564995527,0.0345319211483,0.0243583600968,0.0221344586462,0.0220542140305,0.0220542140305,0.019554566592,0.0188931096345,0.0188123993576,0.0188123993576,0.0187162738293,0.0186483673751,0.0186483673751,0.0184812806547,0.0169492773712,0.0168586503714,0.0163221769035,0.0163221769035,0.0118512464687,0.0112716704607,0.0104810837656,0.0097084576264,0.0097084576264,0.00967316143215,0.00967316143215,0.00963757745922,0.00887752324343,0.00734122795984,0.00709154922515,0.00707771396264,0.00707771396264,0.00706575112417,0.00706575112417,0.00705521600321,0.00678387843072,0.00664327898994,0.00661070644855,0.00647219223902,0.00639070477337,0.00620489567518,0.00619278801605,0.00618231855333,0.00618231855333,0.00601331237704,0.00597747042775,0.00592155894265,0.00581282563508,0.00529595185071,0.00521787209436,0.00521787209436,0.00520768761635,0.00508586410433,0.00495932111517,0.00481818336993,0.00476139131933,0.00475116772577,0.00475116772577,0.00474593089893,0.00474593089893,0.00474593089893,0.00474111828953,0.00473252637312,0.0046617644839,0.00461223255843,0.00432383082807,0.00432383082807,0.00432383082807,0.00418381672353,0.00415226956829,0.00415226956829,0.00414805859327,0.00380595284514,0.00380398356356,0.00378583231941,0.00378583231941,0.00378292379901,0.00378292379901,0.00378292379901,0.00376062490977,0.00366041064262,0.00352914514951,0.00336738559417,0.00332491961308,0.00332491961308,0.00321611203253,0.00320983189158,0.00303392694332,0.0028152090963,0.00281369034201,0.00281083583832,0.00280819553882,0.00280819553882,0.00280819553882,0.00280819553882,0.00280819553882,0.00278910738416,0.00278910738416,0.00278910738416,0.00261669815518,0.00246698223054,0.00246698223054,0.00246698223054,0.00245799822733,0.00244008540176,0.00232699210756,0.00224100332707,0.0022392810788,0.0022392810788,0.00222212565131,0.00222018221393,0.00221925904043,0.00194402295165,0.00194402295165,0.00194315786939,0.00194232247304,0.00194151489995,0.00194073328748,0.00194073328748,0.0016653976636,0.0015563290799,0.00155328901019,0.00151489721611,0.00150710390881,0.00141648296267,0.00141545629594,0.00141356582753,0.00141356582753,0.00141106196679,0.00139180291444,0.00131348625291,0.00123917905148,0.00123917905148,0.00123828090727,0.00123828090727,0.00123743189033,0.000953809532803,0.000733350927476,0.000732819316909,0.000732819316909,0.000722928845789"
Lhasa Liang Fen,5513,81-15 Broadway,Elmhurst,11373.0,18722,"It was a boring sunday, so I decided go hunt down some new restaurants to try and came across this mom and pop shop. When we entered the shop it was extremely tiny with barley any seating, thank god a large group of students was leaving just was we entered. The boss lady was extremely friendly and offered us some free butter tea. It was my first time trying it, and I must say it was like drinking liquid salty butter... however I understand that in certain regions they depend on these drinks to survive the harsh winter. So no point off on this one. What turn me off about this place was not the butter tea nor the crazy spice they use but the weak flavor and ingredients. We got the Liang fen, mono, and beef noodle soup. The Liang fen was extremely watery there it diluted the sauce and made it taste like oily water noodles. The momo was tiny dumplings that did not match the menu photo and tasted like store bought. Finally the beef noodle soup had really thick noodles kinda like udon instead of the photo and had barley any beef in it. When we did find a piece of beef it was either organ or some tendons. For the price, I don't feel it was worth it. But the service was impeccable.

The momos were good, dough was freshly chewy. I tend to like it with more cumin spice though. It is served with pickled daikon. The Bauzi is the Himalayan version of shaved noodle soup although it's shape is handmade. It hade beef, mushrooms and a colorful variety of peppers. It had a nice fresh and clean broth. Great for a cold day like today. The tables have chili oil, salt, mixed soy sauce and vinegar. They offer hot tea, hot water or butter tea for free. Take the butter tea if eating something spicy like the chili oil. It's actually very good tea. The seasoning is mild so all can eat, child friendly food and if you like spice, just ask for some.

Liang Pi Wang,5515,133-35 Roosevelt Ave,Flushing,11354.0,4546,"4.5 Stars! We love liang pi & after reading the reviews about this place, we decided to check it out. The food here is really good & great in value too! We got the liang pi (cold skin noodles), & some spicy chicken n' potato dish that were so so so good. Let's start with the liang pi. It's good but we wouldn't say it's the best. The pancake were delicious! Now, for the spicy chicken n' potato dish, we can't remember the exact name of that amazingly delicious dish but it's easy to order. Just point at the picture of a $12 chicken dish on the menu, that's the one! If we remember it correctly, this is the most expensive dish on the menu. It's a dish for two. It's huge! It came with 2 rice. For $12, guarantee you'll be full! It's great in value & absolutely delicious! It has so much flavor. All total we spent about $22. We couldn't even finish our food because we were totally stuffed! The left over was so much, we could make another meal from it. Amazing food & great value!

Liang Pi Wang,5515,133-35 Roosevelt Ave,Flushing,11354.0,48,"Liang Pi Noodles is definitely one of my favorite noodle dishes overall. I just love the mixture of various sauces and vegetables. It seems like such a simple, easy dish by sight but it is really the balanced amount of sauce and texture of the noodles, that makes the difference. Liang Pi can be eaten as a cold noodles dish or stir-fried dish, the two different ways of eating brings out different strengths of the dish. When eaten cold, I am just craving for the rawness and freshness of it. Stir-fried version makes me love the soft, chewy noodles even more. I cannot even choose how I want it at times! I love Liang Pi mainly because after I finish the entire plate, it leaves me satisfy and not feeling guilty for eating like a piggy. I don't know if this dish is consider healthy in any way at all but I love that it is such a light dish!Okay! I am indeed biased, Xi'an Famous Foods holds first place as my favorite Liang Pi Noodles spot. Liang Pi is my personal must-try at any noodles place that have it on the menu. New World Mall has a vendor that makes it, but they failed miserably. With New York Food Court opened, Liang Pi King was one of the vendors that opened here. Such a bold name, claiming themselves to be! This place actually comes closest in taste, especially the sauce. The sauce is a bit watery and a bit too much leftover when you're done. Be careful and not slurp so hard, otherwise it will get on your shirt! The taste of the sauces is very well balanced and the greens that they put it is very fresh. Overall, I love the sauce combination. The noodles just lacked a bit of texture because it tasted airy and too light. I prefer it to have more texture so that I can munch on it.  Yup!

Delivery came in 30 minutes which is pretty fast in my opinion. * Sweat and sour chicken with vegetable fried rice- the chicken was super crispy but still juicy. They used all white meat, which is often not the case for chinese takeout, and it was seasoned just fine. The sweat and sour sauce was ok. Vegetable fried rice was a bit oily but it had a great flavor to it and IT WASN'T YELLOW!!! So high five for that! :D *Steamed pork dumplings: the dough of the dumpling was wayyyyyyy too thick which is often the case for americanized chinese takeout, shame on me for even ordering this!* Wonton soup: tasty broth, and ok wontons.

Li Wan Restaurant,5518,6428 Metropolitan Ave,Middle Village,11379.0,159305,"Moved to Middle Village a few years ago but only recently discovered this gem. Hands down, best chinese food in Queens. Super fast delivery, they know your address once you give them the phone number and the people who answer the phone are always very nice. I have also eaten in the dining room and service was great and very above average as a sit down restaurant. None of this linoleum table, plastic utensil stuff, they have cloth tableclothes, real silverwear and food comes out in covered silver dishes. Food wise, they probably have the best wonton soup and BBQ spare ribs I have ever had. The soup is flavorful and not ""dishwater""  like so many run of the mill places are famous for. It is dark and savory with 3-4 wontons that are delicious. Crispy noodles that accompany all soups are packaged so they never are subject to the ""staleness"" I have encounterd at others and are very crunchy. Because the broth is so good, all their soups really are so far above any others I have tried. Their sweet and sour chicken is always very crispy and the sauce is the only one I will eat. Anything with the roast pork is yummy as well. Their fried rice is standard, nothing spectacular and can be a bit greasy at times but when compared to all the other great dishes, it is fine.

Li Wan Restaurant,5518,6428 Metropolitan Ave,Middle Village,11379.0,5863,"This is a difficult review to write. This restaurant has always been a favorite in my family. When we are in the area, we come here to have a bite - maybe 2-3 times per year. When we arrived,  we were greeted with eye rolls and major attitude. The man working was bussing, taking orders, serving food, answering the phone and all the other tasks in the front of the house that require more than one person to work. We were sympathetic but he was clearly flustered and angry with us for coming in. We shouldn't be punished for coming in to eat dinner at a restaurant... just saying. The food has also changed and not for the better. I ordered the pepper steak with an eggroll. The egg roll was 99% cabbage and not crisp- very stale. The pepper steak was bland. The beef was chewy and the peppers overcooked. Tables were left dirty way after diners left, as well. Perhaps it was an off day.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,20967,"Had dinner with a friend the other day.  Was pleasantly surprised at this little Argentine restaurant in Cobble Hill.  Their beef empanadas are wonderful.  Nicely spiced with cumin, they have the raisins and a piece of hard boiled egg and the beef is knife cut, not grounded.  A must!!!!  We shared a ""sample parrilla"".  Mostly beef and a  chicken paillard. Served on a cast iron grill, the beef finishes cooking at the table, so, you may want to ask for medium if you like your beef well done.  The beef is high quality, no doubt about this.  Would have liked a less Brooklyn and more Argie parrilla, with blood sausage, grilled tripe, sweet breads, kidneys and the ribs cut the other way around.  The mixed grill comes with one Argentine style pork sausage, which is pretty good.  Salad and mashed potatoes.   We ordered an arugula salad with a mustard dressing, excellent choice.  As for the side salad, you may want to ask dressing on the side or simply olive oil and lemon juice, they use balsamic vinegar which is too sweet to pair with the mixed grill.  Salsa criolla and chimichurri are also pretty good.  The chimichurri can use more flat parsley.   The ""dulce de leche"" crepes, are excellent.  You may just go for coffee and crepes if you have a sweet tooth.  Warm and sweet, light and the perfect bite for an all protein meal!!!!!

We totally enjoyed ourselves here for a quiet intimate Sunday night dinner. My other half was craving steak, and I came across Libertador via yelp. We were torn between ordering the Parillada grilled steak for 2, or the Cortada Marinada Dos (marinated in olive oil/brandy/thyme/rosemary) for 2. Both looked great, but went with the Cortada Marinada. This delicious sirloin was so aromatic w/ flavor of rosemary/garlic... so good!!! We usually like our steak medium well, but they recommended medium because they are thinly sliced and comes out on a hot grill so it'll continue to cook when its on your table. I was unsure about it, but went with it. Definitely a great choice, it looked like it was going to be too much for us, but we actually finished it and enjoyed every bit of it. We also asked for seconds on the chimi churi sauce & sliced tomatoes. The salad that came w/ it was a small portion, seemed to feed only 1. You also have your choice of mash or fries... go w/ the fries!!!! Had 2 glasses of red wine sangria which perfectly complemented the meal. The waitress was excellent, and even gave us another glass on the house as we stayed a bit longer after our meal to enjoy the ambience.

The staff was exceptionally attentive and made my family feel right at home.  The waiters gather around to sing happy birthday, and the owner himself came to check on our table.

The meat is always perfectly cured and seasoned, extremely flavorful, and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Two others in my party have split the mixed grill, which they did not find as satisfying as getting an individual steak due to smaller portion, higher price, and less flavor in the meat.

The hosts had our tables ready to go and seated us so we could wait for the rest of our group to arrive. Some places won't seat you unless the entire group is there AND within a certain time frame. Nope, our hosts were awesome. Once the entire group made it in and the food was served everyone and I mean everyone was delighted with their dish. The meat was tender, juicy and just perfect.

We started with the Beet Salad and an Eggplant appetizer that were very good.  The eggplant was thinly sliced and baked with melted cheese on top and was absolutely delicious.  For entree we had a Porterhouse, a Rib Steak, Lamb Chops, the Strip Steak special with Grand Marnier sauce on the side and three huge potato croquettes, and the ravioli.  All of the steaks and lamb chops were cooked perfectly and well seasoned so they were flavorful.  The Grand Marnier sauce was barely used as that member of the party felt it took away from the flavor of the steak!  The only disappointment was the ravioli which were 6 small ravioli swimming in sauce on a large plate.  I know, it's a steak house, but it was odd to have such a small portion of ravioli for $16.95 when the amazing steaks (all 14oz and up) were between $22-$28. We finished the meal with a flan and a poached pear dessert.  Very nice way to end an enjoyable meal.  Will definitely come back.  A great find. Oh, and the restaurant itself is charming - an old bar/restaurant with beat up wood floors, high ceilings, nearly floor to ceiling windows in front so you can see the charming brownstones across the street.",4.0 star rating,"Port Washington, NY",2,0,0.600000023842,10.1999998093,"dinner,Beet Salad,staff,reservation,ravioli,steak house,restaurant,Eggplant,Rib Steak,sauce,eggplant,Porterhouse,All,steaks,steak,appetizer,cheese,top,entree,ravioli,sauce,sauce,disappointment,potato croquettes,side,lamb chops,flavor,member,party,plate,Strip Steak,meal,pear dessert,way,Grand Marnier,find,Lamb Chops,wood floors,ceilings,floor,brownstones,bar,ceiling windows,front,street,ravioli,portion,meal,flan,steaks","4,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,6,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,3,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7","0.106579855084,0.0782081782818,0.0608032681048,0.0512858852744,0.047742344439,0.0442382618785,0.0392488837242,0.0345249734819,0.0293017234653,0.023105815053,0.0222445707768,0.0221934374422,0.0220959316939,0.0197783727199,0.0197450462729,0.0195271261036,0.0194721668959,0.0194721668959,0.019427375868,0.0177435129881,0.0164890866727,0.0150154465809,0.01427090168,0.0131288841367,0.0131288841367,0.0131033081561,0.0130811929703,0.0130811929703,0.0130811929703,0.0119546987116,0.0117487693205,0.010173807852,0.00891245808452,0.00890264473855,0.00888966023922,0.00888528395444,0.00777864921838,0.00702691404149,0.00702691404149,0.00702691404149,0.00638656970114,0.00614836718887,0.00614836718887,0.00614836718887,0.00614836718887,0.00529639236629,0.00447582732886,0.00447042286396,0.00391120882705,0.00256306654774"

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,58267,"Libertador is a solid place, and this could be a decent regular spot if I lived in the neighborhood.First, I must complain about the bill situation I experienced.  You can see with the attached photo, that a suggested tip of 20% was pen-written on our check.  I have no problem with that, service was actually pretty on point when I came.  However, the suggested 20% was well above what actually 20% was.  It was higher than 20% of the bill even if you included the tax, which in my opinion was VERY shady and shameless.  Come on, I can calculate simple arithmetic in my head.  If you want to trick someone into tipping you more, use a more obscure percentage...Anyway, onto the food.  I did not dock the restaurant any stars for the bill incident.  And I will say that this restaurant would be four stars if you made a meal of just certain items on the menu (primarily the actually Argentinian dishes)First off, the empanadas here are AMAZING.  Garlic fries that top the ones from Yankee Stadium any day of the week.  Mashed potatoes were good here, but if you had to choose one side with your meat entree, get the fries.  Appetizers:  The empanadas are amazing, possibly the best I've ever had.  The shell is flaky, and soft, with the insides nicely moistened by whatever filling you ordered it with, similar to an awesome croissant.  We had the beef, chicken, and black beans/mozzarella.  They were all good, but my favorite was the chicken.  The grilled octopus was very solid, very soft and tender, and flavored well.  You get a tentacle's worth.Fried calamari was very mediocre, not quite slow-cooked to perfection like the octopus was.  It came with a chipotle sauce and a tomato sauce, with the chipotle one being pretty tasty.Yellowfind tuna carpaccio I had no complaints about.  Couldn't really tell how good quality the tuna was because it was so thinly sliced, and had a lime flavor to it that masked the tuna taste quite a bit.  Mussels were good, with the sauce being a great dip for bread as well.  Salads:We had the Pear Arugula Salad, and the Avocado Mozzarella Salad.  Both were salads not bad, with decent portions of the toppings (pear for the former, and mozzarella for the latter, though the avocado portion was somewhat skimpy).  Meats:Skirt steak was very good.  Seasoned well, very tender and juicy.  I wish all of their other meats were like this.  Rib eye was ordered medium rare, but was way overcooked, was dry, and lacked flavor.  At first glance at the menu, I was surprised that the rib eye was slightly cheaper than the skirt steak, but after taking a first bite of each, I understood why.  Lamb chops were decent.  Not bad, but nothing to rave about.  It was juicy and tender enough, but lacked flavor as well.  Pastas:We ordered the Ravioli with pink sauce and the Seafood Pasta with the garlic oil sauce.  To be brief, their sauces were done well, particularly the olive oil and garlic with seafood.  However, the pastas itself were overcooked and not al dente like I like it.  Desserts: The pancake rolls (crepes?) were good, very light, and complimented well with the ice cream on top.  Almond ice cream was just vanilla ice cream with almonds in it....And the chocolate mouse was pretty nice and smooth, topped with whipped cream.",3.0 star rating,"New York,

This seems to be a common complaint about this place when you read their reviews. But any charred meats are still good to me. The pappardelle was a bland stomach churning mess. It was a sign when they spelled it wrong. The pasta was significantly overcooked and frankly tasted pretty bad.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,168185,"We have been watching this space since the deli closed years ago and were so glad to see a restaurant opening a block away. We tried it last night and can only say that I hope it gets better.ATMOSPHEREIt's pretty. The restaurant has great lighting and the decor is very understated warmth but it's a bit tight. The bar and open kitchen take up about 1/3 of the width, which isn't that big to start, so tables are close together and the walk to the single bathroom located in the back is narrow with bar patrons, servers and runners and diners all trying to get through. Also, some patrons are obviously confused by the hard-to-pull chain on the old-fashioned toilet as both times we went in, it wasn't flushed.FOODFood was ok but nothing to shout about. My lentil, arugula and goat cheese salad was excellent. I wasn't that impressed with the steak - it was unseasoned and a bit tough -- came presented on a plate with a pile of mashed potatoes and no sauces offered. Didn't try any of the sides.We ordered the corn empanadas and ravioli for our 9-year old and she wouldn't eat either of them. The empanadas were way too cheesy and the ricotta/mushroom ravioli were a bit sweet - didn't get any flavor from the mushrooms at all. (Note: a friend who had been the day before raved about the spinach empanadas though). Our friend's calamari were undercooked so the dough was pasty and tasted of flour. She gave one to the man celebrating his birthday at the next table, 10"" away, and he agreed. My husband liked his chicken Milanese and the fries were excellent - cooked to a crisp perfectly in oil infused with herbs, rosemary perhaps.For dessert, panqueques dulce de leche were tops and what kid doesn't love chocolate gelato? Mine does, especially three scoops piled high.I found there are no small portions on the menu -- smallest steak is 12 ounces and the salad was enough for the table. SERVICEWe were seated fairly quickly and the staff moved a table to accommodate us at the peak of the dinner rush. Our orders were taken and drinks arrived promptly followed not too long by bread with olive oil and then our appetizers/salads. And then it slowed down considerably. It took a very long time to get our main courses after they'd cleared the first course plates.

This wasn't even rare...this was not cooked. The dessert was good overall, the flan was not for me but that is most likely just because my grandmother makes it better.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,26,"My friend offered to take me out for my birthday and asked me to choose the restaurant. Based on Yelp feedback, I chose Libertador. The restaurant itself is very cozy and tastefully decorated in a rustic sort of way. It was a rainy Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty. I imagine this is not always the case but being the holiday season and all... The service here is excellent though they should check on your water a little more often. Special kudos to our very accommodating server, Frank from Peru...gracias! as well as his friendly assistant.  I liked the music they played but I think traditional Argentinean music would have been better especially since they have soccer games on a large screen to view during dinner.We ordered the mixed grill which is served on a very hot iron grill with potato and salad as well as two sauces. We split the garlic fries that were very good. The salad was a disappointing lettuce and tomato salad...nothing special. The two dipping sauces were excellent.I would love to rate this restaurant four or five stars but unfortunately part of the mixed grill we ordered was not up to what we expected. The chicken and skirt steak were above average, the sausage average but the the short ribs and New York strip (I think that was the cut) were too fatty. Thus while we would come back, the meat was a bit of a disappointment.I am settling on a 3.5 star rating and a thank you to the staff for being so accommodating.  At this point I am hoping to raise the review to 4 stars on my next visit if the meat is a bit tenderer and less fatty.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,7.59999990463,"friend,restaurant,grill,birthday,restaurant,lettuce,feedback,sort,meat,sausage average,Frank,Yelp,Libertador,service,case,music,place,way,holiday season,salad,grill,music,garlic fries,tomato salad,server,sauces,dipping sauces,water,kudos,assistant,potato,screen,soccer games,dinner.,nothing,strip,star rating,meat,Peru,Argentinean,stars,bit,staff,fatty,visit,review,New York,restaurant,stars,part,ribs,average,chicken,cut","1,2,6,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,4,7,6,5,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,7,4,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.138368397951,0.102316394448,0.0836758464575,0.0713587105274,0.0521639585495,0.0426102429628,0.0342049598694,0.0340309217572,0.0289543569088,0.0273023284972,0.0266570933163,0.0203111525625,0.0203111525625,0.0180819630623,0.0160651933402,0.0156551524997,0.0155111402273,0.0130420951173,0.0129581047222,0.0109145343304,0.0109145343304,0.0101832710207,0.0100170820951,0.00996385794133,0.00996035896242,0.00908677466214,0.00905374065042,0.0087329922244,0.00871596392244,0.00870124064386,0.00868827383965,0.00868827383965,0.00868827383965,0.00868827383965,0.00793112348765,0.00591406365857,0.00590851297602,0.00572233553976,0.00516213336959,0.00514571880922,0.00513669569045,0.00467213429511,0.00409132242203,0.00408774614334,0.00408774614334,0.00408774614334,0.00350167253055,0.00326384673826,0.00326384673826,0.00310158776119,0.00259446306154,0.00259446306154,0.00259446306154,0.0025617708452"

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,171708,"We looked for a nice new place (for us) to eat on Halloween night. I was looking for a place that had a mix of great salads that also had some good entree options. We found this place on a ""best salads in NYC"" list and decided to try since it was in our neighborhood. We arrived and there were many families with costumed children (so cute!) having dinner. We did not have a reservation so were asked to wait at the bar. This was fine, and we looked over the menu while we waited to be seated. Once we were seated by the hostess, it wouldn't be until I asked the hostess after FIFTEEN minutes of waiting with no ""Hello!"" ""I'll be with you in a moment"", nothing. She grabbed someone and then after another 5 minutes he came over and quickly took our order (we ordered everything at once since we had a sinking feeling we wouldn't see him again), and rushed off. We saw him again once. On top of the lack of attention and service, the wait for the food was very long (I ordered a salad with steak topping and he ordered a chicken dish). This, coupled with the below average service made the experience sour before our plates were even brought out. Luckily, the food was the only saving grace although I wouldn't say it was the best or even worth the long wait. The manager could be seen around the restaurant, greeting and talking to other patrons, but somehow always skipping our table... At the end of the night, the hostess brought our check and charged it for us (our ""waiter"" was just much too busy to be bothered). As I stood to put my coat on, the manager came bustling past to ask how the meal was...Note to management: Your food is good. Take the time to train staff that can manage and provide service at any traffic level. Never make the consumer fee forgotten. Also, you may want to come up with a more efficient timing plan for the kitchen staff; you have to make some decisions regarding priority if you are going to be partnering with Seamless.From the boyfriend: Overall experience was disappointing.

Very reasonable prices.The blah: Waiter was frazzled and easily annoyed, was a little too pushy about us getting more food and drinks. For desert we had the Charlotte, so kudos to this place on even having that on the menu because it is a very traditional Argentine dessert, but then the thing itself was terrible: cheap ice-cream, cheap chocolate sauce and not too much of it.

Was not a huge fan of the chicken/potato but LOVEd the beef and the corn. They ARE piping hot. EVERYTHING came out piping hot. The hubby loved the skirt steak.

Others have praised the appetizers, especially the empanadas and the meatballs. Definite starters.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,8188,"Brooklyn is definitely good for certain things but authentic ethnic foods, not so much.  It's funny reading people saying how great the steak is or how this is the best Argentinean restaurant they've tried. Well, it's probably because most of these folks live in Brooklyn or Manhattan and have never stepped foot in a real Argentinean or Uruguayan place. The place is cute, I give it that. And the octopus that everyone raves about was decent. A little salty but decent and nicely sized. And then everything went downhill. Me and a friend ordered the mixed grill for 2. It came sizzling on a weird cast iron skillet that keeps the meat cooking. Why? Why the fuck would you do that? This made absolutely no sense. Have these people been to a real Argentinean steakhouse? No respectable parrilada would do that to steaks. My short ribs were already super thin and I knew right away that they would be well done in a few seconds. They need to be served in a metal box tray that keeps the meat warm, not cooking. You can go to any parrilada in Jackson Heights and they'll show you how it's supposed to be done. As for the meat, very very disappointing. Everything was salty and the short ribs were salty as shit. It was like they poured a box of Morton's right on the meat before serving. The chicken was dry as expected, the skirt was chewy and flavorless, the short ribs were so thin, they reminded me of kalbi.  They all had so much black pepper that I couldn't even taste the meat. The sirloin was the only piece of meat cooked right - medium rare, but was still flavorless and chewy. The best part of the grill was the sausage, because that was the least salty - imagine that?  I was surprised that they didn't include morcilla or chinchulines in their mixed grill but I should've expected that given the mostly non-ethnic clientele here.  The chimichurri they served was absolutely not what a respectable Argentinean restaurant should call chimichurri and the amount they give is embarrassing. And what kind of Argentinean steakhouse doesn't give bread? I can go on and on about what's wrong about this place but I'll stop here.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,110157,"This place definitely delivers!!! I had a great experience here. I took my girlfriend here this weekend, and while the place is small, it's intimate, and very cute decor. Even in the bathroom, they had the old fashioned chain on the toilet bowl. Sat down, our waitress was very attentive. They had the menu, and the special was the seafood paella. Although, we passed on it, hopefully they have it again. There was a large party on the other side of the restaurant, to which I've caught a glimpse of it as I went to the bathroom. It looked delicious. We ordered a lamb appetizer, that came with some potatoes. Delicious! The meat melted in my mouth like butter, and the potatos were already salty. Not excessive, but just enough to be right. I ordered a Cabernet-Syrah blended mix wine, and I was thrilled to see that some of their wines had the points on the side from the wine spectator. This one was 92pts, which is very very good, FYI. I forget the name of it, but I would definitely have it again. The Steak Tanafare, I'm probably spelling it incorrectly it was the last choice of steak the bottom of the dinner menu aside from the traditional steak menu. Whatever! It was delicious. It was a steak which they wrapped in pecorino romano cheese, peppers, and cilantro. DELICIOUS. Although, at times a little too much on the spices, the dish was excellent, along with the mashed potatoes that went with it.  Another great date place, or if your living in the neighborhood, and are looking for a nice hole in the wall place with great food, this place will not disappoint you.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,132668,This steakhouse is a Very nice and intimate restaurant in the heart of Brooklyn. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Food-To start I had the fried calamari which were very clean and tasty and is accompanied by two sauces. For entree I had the rib eye steak (medium) with French fries which was very delectable and cooked perfectly. My date had the skirt steak with mash potatoes and a side order of oven roasted vegetables which she couldn't stop raving about. Drinks- I had the sangria which wasn't as strong as I liked it to be so it was decent. I fell in the love with their Malbec wine and Chardonnay was good as wellMy only con is since it is a small place it can get smoky in there but if you don't mind the smell of amazingly cooked meat then this place is for you!,4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",1,0,0.699999988079,5.40000009537,"steakhouse,restaurant,heart,sangria,Brooklyn,staff,Chardonnay,fries,vegetables,fried calamari,Food,rib eye steak,skirt steak,sauces,entree,mash potatoes,side order,Drinks,con,place,French,smell,meat,wellMy,love,wine,Malbec","2,2,7,7,2,1,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,3","0.173979863524,0.141675382853,0.115172348917,0.0784585922956,0.0691650807858,0.0680214762688,0.0636399686337,0.0434768274426,0.0333191379905,0.0235796645284,0.0213710274547,0.0180787686259,0.0180279389024,0.0144521901384,0.0143997659907,0.0143592339009,0.0143592339009,0.0139687685296,0.0119798080996,0.00948574673384,0.00853648968041,0.0067790960893,0.0067790960893,0.00579754728824,0.00429656310007,0.00429656310007,0.00254381843843"

Attentive and funny staff who are super accommodating and RIGHT on the money when you ask for recommendations. Skirt steak over rib eye, really?

Fries that comes with it was superb, that's only if you like them greasy potatoes crispy.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,571,"It's with a heavy heart that I give this restaurant 2 stars. This is my third time at Libertador Cobble Hill. Was very impressed with the food the first two times even though the service was sketchy. Met the owner, Paulo, during my first visit. Great guy and the beautiful interior is his personal handiwork. Just a lovely place ...This past Saturday night, my wife and I took our out-of-town friends there and I'm now convinced they'll be going out of business fairly soon unless drastic changes are made. Hear this: the food is good. Kitchen staff is on their game. Grilled meats are delicious and beautifully seasoned. Salads and sides are imaginative and tasty. Kitchen guys, the two stars aren't directed at you. On Saturday, I experienced the most inept service of any Brooklyn restaurant I've visited over the last twelve months. Laundry list: --Restaurant was half full on a Saturday night (red flag) yet had to chase down the waiter to take our drink order after having sat for five minutes.--Only bottled beer available. That's fine. Ordered Stella which is up on the wall in the line up. Waiter had never heard of it and they certainly don't have it. Uhhh ... okay. --Bottled beer came without glasses (forgiven) yet requested glasses never arrived. I looked over my shoulder and the bartender was holding two of them in his hands (apparently he received the request) but stood there chatting it up with the two waiters. They were paying zero attention to the tables. Had to stand and walk over to get them to bring the glasses. --My friend needed water. Where was the waiter? (not making this up) Out on the sidewalk having a friendly, prolonged chat with a couple walking a dog. You feel like a jerk standing up and walking around trying to find someone to help you but what can you do?--Time to order appetizers and entrees but no one's coming to take our order. Let's wait patiently for five or ten minutes and enjoy the evening and surely someone will come over. Well, that's not working. Had to turn and wave our arms. -- No one comes to bus the empty appetizer plates and serving forks and spoons that consume the table. We piled them up as best we could and (again) had to flag someone down to take them. Our waiter was over by the bar, buried in his iPhone. Someone finally came over and nicely took them away. We didn't bother asking them to give it a wipe cuz we knew that wasn't going to happen. -- Okay, I can hear the steaks coming off the grill so I guessing they'll be brought over any second. Now completely in self service mode, I again hail a waiter and ask them to bring forks, which were taken away after the appetizer, and steak knives. No anticipation whatsoever. Need I go on? To be clear, I've seen this staff in action before. They're nice guys but the restaurant is truly rudderless. Is there a manager? Anyone in charge? Hello? Didn't want to post this review without reaching out to the restaurant directly but their website has no contact info so I have no choice.Libertador. You have a beautiful space, good food and a kitchen that's on its game. You'd better get a handle on the staff or you'll be out of business come this time next year.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,51836,"The meal started out well. The appetizers were fine (octopus, garlic shrimp and meatballs) and the waiter was very pleasant. Where it went wrong was with the steak. One of my dinner companions had the filet mignon, medium rare. It's not my favorite cut of meat, but it is hers and she was really looking forwards to it. Unfortunately, when it arrived it was a little tougher than the knife and a good 2 ounces of the 14 total was pure gristle. Cutting through the meat was literally impossible. That can happen (when it's not properly butchered) but what was worse was the waiter's response when he was shown the chunk of inedible cartilage -- nothing. No offer to get  a properly butchered piece of filet, nothing. That was disappointing. My other dinner companion had the special, NY strip steak. It was a hard sell (he originally wanted the ribeye off the bone) but he was game so he relented and took the special. That steak was OK, though there was no description of the seasonal side so he was stuck with some melon and corn hash rather than the ""famous fries"" he thought he was getting. My own steak, the 22oz on-the-bone ribeye was unfortunately flat, though it was cooked and seasoned properly. When I get a 22OZ ribeye on the bone, I don't expect a thin stick of a bone and 1/4"" thick steak. A great deal of the steak was attached to cartilage instead of bone (there was little bone) and about 1/4 of the steak went to waste.This was an unfortunate evening. It's clear they have a good eye for seasoning and they can cook a steak to order.

I think this place is spot on for what this neck of the woods needs. The vibe is sexy, but totally child friendly and we really enjoyed our meal and the service.  We had the mixed grill and all the different meats were perfectly cooked. The fries were delicious and they were super helpful about getting us in and out as quickly as possible so we could get our five month old home.  Definitely better than some of the mediocre restaurants that have opened up in the area that only take cash, take forever to get a table and you spend more money than you can even understand how, and are still hungry when you leave.

Started off with one of their specialty drinks (forgot the name, but it looked like a white wine sangria). Too sweet for my taste, but having some beer to even it out did make it better. As for the meal itself, I ordered the skirt steak (medium rare), with mashed potatoes on the side (there is a fries option as well). My friend had the pappardelle in bolognese meat sauce. My steak was cooked PERFECTLY medium rare and it came with a side of two different sauces-loved and finished both (ask for extra, it may come in handy)!

The place is cozy; from the smell to the lighting, it's quite perfect. I would best describe this place as - if a romantic French style restaurant and a steak house restaurant had a baby it would be Libertador. So you get good portions but its not savage and you still get amazing unique flavorful tasting Argentinian food. We ordered the zucchini soup which was creamy and a great light appetizer. We drank a wine based cocktail (don't remember the name) but it had a hint of tang and mint. So simply refreshing. The empanada are unique so it's worth a try but not our go to on the menu. For entrees we ordered the lamb and the porterhouse. If you like lamb check out my picture it's like 5-6 pieces of this amazing lamb rack. It was very tender and very satisfying.  Don't get the mashed potatoes it's super plain. The porterhouse was huge had a great grilled taste. Definitely get their fries because it's unbelievable with garlic and Parmesan. We ordered the pouchy pear for dessert but they accidentally brought us the pancake dulce de leche which was the best mistake ever. It was more like a thin crepe flute filled with a fluffy warm dulce de leche filling with vanilla ice cream and fruit. We were quite content with this. The staff here by the way is probably the one main reason we love coming here. Never have I had such great service. And I love great service. There's nothing worse than feeling like you hate the waiter, it can ruin the experience. Not here. We were asked how we were doing and the conversations with our waiter were brief (perfect) but it was polite, attentive, and nice (perfect). We asked our waiter where we could find an ATM we were a couple dollars short for our cab and he literally suggested we just borrow it from him since it was cold out. We didn't take his money but still the gesture was so genuinely nice. The staff really makes sure you feel like you're their number one concern and friend.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,2258,"After seeing this place sit unused for a number of years after Bonafide Deli moved from this location to Kane and Hicks it was nice to see it reopen as something interesting. Libertador is a high end yet casual Argentinian restaurant with a meat-centric menu. The rustic yet classy atmosphere is beautiful and fits the neighborhood wonderfully. Prices are a bit higher than what you'd want to pay for a weekly casual dinner but is reasonable for what you're getting as most meals are $20-30. To start we tried a couple of their empanadas (2 for $8), we ordered beef and chicken but recieved beef and ham. The crusty dough was perfect but I wasn't thrilled with the fillings, especially as the beef had lots of peppers and even olives inside of it, something they should have described on the menu as my girlfriend loaths them. For a meal we split the Parillada Para Dos (mixed grill for two for $45). This comes on a cast iron grill with short ribs, prime skirt steak, new york strip steak, chicken breast, chorizo, served with salad and your choice of homemade mashed potatoes or their ""famous"" french fries provenzal (of course we opted for the fries). I found most of the meat to be a bit greasy and not the most tender cuts of meat except for I believe it was the strip steak which was perfect. The salad came in a tiny bowl on the side which wasn't anything special. The fries definitely did live up to our expectations however, they were super crispy garlic fries that I would definitely get again. Although I wasn't blown away by everything I had here the atmosphere and service was wonderful and I would definitely consider coming back for the NY Strip and fries in the future.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,6.80000019073,"place,something,number,location,strip steak,Bonafide Deli,Kane,Hicks,restaurant,lots,Libertador,Argentinian,garlic fries,atmosphere,bowl,Parillada Para Dos,menu,neighborhood,dinner,Prices,beef,beef,beef,dough,new york strip steak,skirt steak,chicken,something,menu,meal,meals,cast iron grill,salad,empanadas,ham,olives,girlfriend,fillings,peppers,couple,chicken breast,chorizo,choice,short ribs,salad,mashed potatoes,anything,side,expectations,fries,atmosphere,service,everything,fries,french fries,meat,meat,most,NY Strip,course,provenzal,tender cuts","7,7,7,2,6,7,1,1,2,7,3,2,6,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7","0.192057669163,0.0683506801724,0.0599367432296,0.0599367432296,0.0448822751641,0.0357121452689,0.0357121452689,0.0357121452689,0.0355587638915,0.0322146490216,0.0208626948297,0.017047714442,0.016245007515,0.015309705399,0.0151288118213,0.0150604760274,0.0125708486885,0.0109454644844,0.010905704461,0.0102372132242,0.00980816595256,0.00922804512084,0.00922804512084,0.00874984078109,0.00839549209923,0.00839549209923,0.00839445833117,0.00837510637939,0.00837510637939,0.00835877843201,0.00790185015649,0.00763694941998,0.00763694941998,0.00734557863325,0.00734557863325,0.0073286392726,0.0073286392726,0.0073286392726,0.0073286392726,0.00707175489515,0.00668254168704,0.00668254168704,0.00668254168704,0.00668254168704,0.00629785377532,0.00558280805126,0.00530501641333,0.00497935060412,0.00497334077954,0.00494048511609,0.00469500757754,0.00343988626264,0.00343988626264,0.00314655923285,0.00314655923285,0.00274878321216,0.00274878321216,0.00274878321216,0.0025591335725,0.00219050282612,0.00219050282612,0.00218723365106"

Delicious and generous portion, the bell peppers were so fresh and fragrant! Next we shared what I'll call a sampler platter including chicken, an empanada, the skirt steak, and the Argentine sausage! The skirt steak was incredible; buttery, tender, perfectly seasoned- a generous portion, chicken had a great seasoning, the sausage was moist and flavorful, empanada was golden brown and packed full of flavor. The presentation was great and food came out piping out on a hot griddle. This was a great portion size for two. We ended the meal with a glass of their homemade warm  Malbec wine (amazing- cant wait to come back for this when it's colder out). I'm not a big dessert girl, but the dulce de leche crepes were caramely and gooey and the crepe was buttery and rich ! This is a must have dessert!

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,4751,"My husband is Argentine and we were so excited that this place opened up a few blocks from our apartment. The service and atmosphere were wonderful. One small downside is that the servers do not (as someone else stated previously) know much about the wine. This point doesn't really bother me. Cons: The steak was extremely thickly seasoned with PEPPER! So thickly, in fact, that my husband scraped it off. Argentines just don't cook steak like that. The provoleta was delicious but the portion was about 1/4 of what you'd get in most other NY restaurants even though the price was higher. Which brings me to the final con, and that is the price. Nearly every dish is overpriced by a few dollars. (And yes, the menus is huge...not sure why they have so many salads.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,72400,"WHY BE AVERAGE WHEN YOU COULD BE GREAT?I went here last weekend to celebrate a family friend's birthday and let's just say we all know our way around Latin American cuisine.  We were all very excited to have another Latin American option in South Brooklyn. Unfortunately, this was good but not great. I say that because this neighborhood is filled with some amazing restaurants and if Libertador is going to stand the test of time, it needs to make some upgrades.  My recommendations to you: Service = attentive but not intrusive. Need to strengthen your reservation process. Wine selection = we had an excellent Cabernet. The whole table was raving about it.  But your waiters don't know anything about what wine goes with the food. Music and ambiance = very good. Should upgrade music. Consider pandora/spotify account.  Put some art on the walls. Everything else is great.  Menu= Your menu is too big and not that creative. We were never informed of specials. if people want purely authentic Argentinian they go to Queens. But a modern restaurant in South Brooklyn needs to be edgy.  You need to think about Argentinian food that is authentic and outside the box. Get creative.   Food =  I give you credit for the skirt steak, mash potatoes, and fries. All very delicious. Your picante was also good. But the rest of our parillada was just okay. Why does the parillada not have morcilla which is an Argentinian food staple? The chicken and other meets were uneventful.  Because the meal was so average, we did not order dessert or a second bottle of wine. You can get there. But really push yourselves to be better than average.  I'll give you another chance in a few months.

Libertador,5519,404 Henry St,Brooklyn,11201.0,98434,"Liberator is a restaurant that I have been dieing to try for quite some time.  After my visit I realized I waited too long and wish I had experienced their food sooner.  It's simply amazing.  Liberator is a quaint, dimly lit, rustic in decor, Argentinian style restaurant with an extremely welcoming and friendly staff. I came to Liberator on a Saturday evening around 8pm, with no reservations.  I was cordially greeted by the maitre' d who said my wait for a party of four would be about 20 minutes. We sat at the small bar that is located upon entrance and we ordered a glass of Alma De Los Andes, Malbec. $10.00.  It was worth every cent. By the time we were done with our wine our table was ready.   With no hesitation our friendly waiter came to take our order.  We had no appetizers and went straight for the main courses. Everything we ordered was served for two, such as:22 Oz Grilled Sliced Marinated Prime Sirloin for two. It was ordered medium rare.  The sirloin was tender, juicy and extremely flavorful.  The meat itself was not veiny or chewy.  It comes with the option of mashed potatoes or french fries as a side. $45.00 and worth it.Mixed Grill for two, which is really portioned for three.  It comes with, Short Ribs, Prime Skirt Steak, New York Strip, Chicken Breast and Chorizo.  It comes with the option of french fries or mashed potatoes.  This dish is served on a piping hot skillet.  Each piece of meat was tender, juicy and flavorful and the meats were quality for the size of portion you get. $45.00. Exceptional dish.Liberator's wine list is pretty extensive.  Offering wines from different countries and options of red or white.  I chose a Malbec Reserve by the name of ""Alma De Los Andes.""  It was a dry, full bodied and smooth finish wine that left no aftertaste. $50.00.  Excellent wine. So good we ordered three bottles. We were so stuffed there was no room for dessert.  I was pleased with my experience at Liberator.

The bagel was so hard that I could barely bite into it and was loaded with cream cheese, which is fine because I just took the excess off. The coffee was filled with sugar and came cold which also was fine because I just heated it up. The only decent thing were the home fries which came nice and hot and seemed fresh.

Liberty Pizzeria,5524,482 Myrtle Ave,Brooklyn,11205.0,178061,"We found Liberty via Seamless, where upon viewing the menu, we were delighted to see that they allowed ordering toppings on specific halves of your pizza. That meant I could have pepperoni on my half (which my wife doesn't eat) and tomatoes on my wife's half (which I didn't want), while still both getting our mushrooms and green peppers, without having to order two pizzas. We duly selected ""Mushrooms (whole pizza)"" and ""Green peppers (whole pizza)"" from the section of the menu entitled ""Toppings (whole pizza),"" then ""Pepperoni (left half)"" from the section of the menu entitled ""Toppings (left half),"" then ""Tomatoes (right half)"" from the section of the menu entitled ""Toppings (right half)."" Given how well the menu was laid out, that should have gone rather smoothly, don't you think?Unfortunately, when we submitted our order, it apparently printed out at the restaurant like this: ""Mushrooms, Green peppers, Pepperoni (left half), Tomatoes (right half)."" The morons at Liberty who provided their menu and instructions to Seamless didn't stop to think that it might be helpful to specify ""whole"" with toppings that should be on the whole pizza, or perhaps not have the toppings print out in sentence (rather than list) format, or both. So when we received our pizza, it had the first three toppings on the left half only, and tomatoes on the right half only.In addition, we ordered a 2-liter bottle of Coke, but received Pepsi. You may personally think that's like getting Schweppes Ginger Ale instead of Canada Dry Ginger Ale, but to many if not most people who strongly prefer Coke, it's like ordering wine and receiving sewage. It's not a generic cola and shouldn't be substituted without warning. If you serve Pepsi and not Coke, the menu should say that. If you're out of Coke, call me on the phone and ask me what I want instead. That's how customer service works.On the other hand, at least our thoroughly incorrect order showed up after we'd been waiting 95 minutes, when we'd been told it would take 50. And part of the box had been crushed in transit. So that was awesome.When we called Liberty to complain, they brusquely told us to contact Seamless. Seamless contacted Liberty, and Liberty refused to process a refund because as far as they were concerned, they constructed the pizza the printed order had told them to construct - even though it was their fault the order printed in a way that was easy for their own people to misinterpret. They insisted it was OUR fault for ordering wrong, despite the fact that the menu itself, and what we had selected on our computer screen, could not possibly have been clearer.Eventually we had the charge reversed on our credit card, but it was at our generous credit card company's expense. That's because Liberty once again fought our dispute, and since a service was rendered that sort of vaguely resembled the one that was ordered, they get to keep the money they received. Our credit card wants to keep our business. Liberty obviously doesn't.Is anyone willing to bet their hard-earned money on a pizza to see whether Liberty has fixed the problem with their menu?

(Side-by-side comparison of fresh pepperoni slices) This place also does a good gluten free pizza, which my girlfriend with celiacs can eat without harm.Cons: I find the pizza not to be as good as Luigi's. The fact that I am comparing Liberty to a competing place down the street isn't lookin too good. The interior of the place has no thrills.  Personally, it doesn't feel too welcoming.

Liberty Pizzeria,5524,482 Myrtle Ave,Brooklyn,11205.0,86582,"Pretty standard pizza. I ordered a large mushroom pie from Liberty Pizzeria for dinner on Sunday since my usual delivery place closes early on Sundays. The ingredients weren't particularly unique, but there also wasn't anything wrong with it - just the right amount of cheese and sauce and the mushrooms didn't taste over- or under-cooked. It did come a little bit less crispy than I usually like, but in Liberty Pizzeria's defense, I forgot to ask for it to be cooked Well Done. Another good point is the prices are pretty cheap compared to some of the other areas near me. A lot of the similarly priced places come out far worse than here, so that's always a nice bonus.Something interesting I noticed the next day - reheating the pizza was pretty great.

This deli/ ""bodega"" (not sure if I can even call it that since it's owned by a middle eastern family), has a variety of things you may need all day and night long. However, I usually only come here for it's sandwiches.I've been eating their sandwiches for the past 15 years and not once have I been disappointed!! Their hero subs are on point, and the meat portion they give is satisfying. And the best thing is, their prices haven't changed a bit in the last decade or so. You could grab a foot-long hero with everything (choice of cheese, lettuce, mayo, tomato--you know, the usual) for around $5-$6 --depending on the type of meat you get. And did I mention, their sandwiches are simply the best? The meat is always fresh and like I've said, I've been coming to this deli for over a decade now and they have never disappointed.The people at the counter have changed over the years but since it's a family owned business, you run into a couple of familiar faces once you start coming here frequently. The owner is the mid aged middle eastern man with dark, curly hair. He has a bunch of his sons working--one who is a bit over weight, the other not so much. He also has a bald brother who works there.  The management here is amazing. They are very kind. As for the options--they have a plethora of breakfast options you can grab and go. Prices are average. They also have both alcoholic and no alcoholic drinks, as well as a fridge for ice cream.

It was overall a simple straight forward sandwich with fresh ingredients. Since I was hungry, I ordered a quiche to supplement my meal. The quiche had a blend of being light but yet very filling.

You follow it, and you enter into the cafe you've seen in your dreams. This is where corporate food goes to die and where real New Yorkers can enjoy the final frontier of cafe atmosphere. The mint lemonade stings your tongue in a beautiful, motherly way, bringing you back to the days of Reagan and cassette tapes (don't ask me why). The homemade chocolate chip cookies melt before they even hit your mouth, and you leap for joy as you lick your saltily smudged fingers. The salads are heavenly: the tomatoes are soft and bursting with nostalgia, the greens are leafy and smothered with dressing. And the focaccia is otherworldly; the doughy texture hits you like a pillow: you might even float away...and then you get the onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic and olive oil all at once. Other greatest hits include the iced chocolate, the chicken salad, and basically ANY baked good. Take a trip to LIC just for this. Hell, move to the neighborhood just for this.

Plus, their baristas are on point and are always very sweet. This is a locally-owned business, and one of the two owners is pretty much always there and happy to say hello. You can tell that every item prepared is made with true care and love for what they do. They do have a few tables to sit but keep in mind, you won't find any public bathrooms here. The park across the street has got you covered there. Consistency is really important to me - that every latte, and every food item I order is always delicious, made well, and on point.

Also, the coffee apparatus is shiny and impressive, so if you're a coffee aficionado, this is likely a place for you. I usually just get black coffee so most of this is lost on me.The food selection is limited. Pretty standard suite of baked goods and a limited selection of sandwiches. In my most recent visit, I got the vegetarian sandwich, which had squash, eggplant, various other vegetables, and goat cheese. It was good, all the veggies tasted fresh, but it definitely needed something salty and potentially something oily (maybe a different type of goat cheese?). I have two issues with this place: 1) their credit card minimum is higher than the price of a coffee. I rarely carry cash, so whenever I'm looking for coffee before work, I pass this place and go to Dunkin Donuts instead. I'm sure they can figure out a way to profitably serve coffee (especially drip coffee) AND have people pay with cards. 2) their focaccia, which is delicious, is basically a square slice of pizza.

The food choices closeby are fairly atrocious :( altho I haven't tried their coffee, I must rave about how delicious their sandwiches are, particularly the ham. They use the ham in bone type, so it's a really hearty helping of protein. I love their bread. The sandwich is soooo filling you will easily be full for 8 hours minimum. They are priced very reasonably for 7.50, with very quality ingredients. There's the option to add your choice of toppings. They use a mustard/mayo spread... Very delicious. Great lunch option. Sometimes there are specials, I've seen chicken pot pie! There's a variety of pastries to go with your drink. And then there's their chocolate chip cookie. Admittedly it is quite salty, but nonetheless delicious. Priced at $2 but well worth it. They offer speciality teas and drinks as well. This is a lovely cafe to sit and pass time. It's very clean and peaceful ambiance. Only semi gripe is, it's not very take out friendly. I ordered ahead and they needed a charge card beforehand, fair but $2 tip was charged without prior consent.

I've loved it since before it opened (I have to admit that I know of the the peeps behind the scenes, but I am not biased) and finally got the chance to experience the restaurant on their first night of evening hours.Now, again, if I go to a restaurant that I've never tried before and it has a burger on the menu, I will automatically order the burger, even if I throw out the idea of trying something else. Nope. Burger. Why? Because if you can make a good burger chances are I'll like almost everything else. On the other hand, if you screw up the burger, we won't be able to hang.  With that said, I ordered the burger and I'm so glad I did. I asked for medium and it came back more medium rare than medium, but I'm actually pleased with how it came out. It had a ton of flavor and was moist and juicy.  Everything on the burger was perfect too, the bun, the cheese, the lettuce. It was all perfectly put together. The burger came with a oyster potato hash which is divine. No. I'm not lying. It's freaking divine. I highly recommend that if you don't get something that comes with the hash that you order it on the side because it's worth every bite. My friend ordered the octopus and I had a bit and it was delicious--perfectly seasoned and grilled and soft. So good! For dessert we shared the apple crisp. Now, it is good, but was a bit off. I'm not sure why or what exactly made me not love it, but it was just alright. Part of me just wants to say that there was too much salt, but there was something else that threw me off and I can't recall what the flavor was. The red wine that we had was delicious (can't remember the name, but it was the first one on the list) and the coffee I had after dessert, to balance the fact that I may have drunk a little too much wine was really good. I can't wait to return to try brunch and maybe even lunch. Oh and before I forget--ambiance and music--total wins each! The music playing totally reminded me of my ipod, which is clearly why I'm a fan, but it fit the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly.  The back is small, so don't expect too much space, but once you're inside, it's cozy and warm and perfect for cold nights like last night.  Also the staff is very friendly and welcoming/helpful.

In either case the people were pretty friendly about it and we ordered take-out. We got a salad and a BLT. Food came out really quick and was very reasonably priced. Both were solid.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,31116,"I went to LIC Market for Saturday brunch but left with mixed feelings.Just as some restaurants has bread while you're waiting for a meal, LIC Market one-ups this by also offering small pieces of carrot cake and some breakfast pastries. I enjoyed the three pieces of carrot cake I quickly gobbled enough, and having this as complementary is a huge selling point.However, what I'm mixed on is the $14 slow roasted duck hash (which is described on the website as ""crisp potatoes, red onion, peppers, dried cherries & pine nuts with two fried eggs""). The eggs were by far the best part - because they're served on top of the dish, when you cut them the yolk runs and seeps into everything else. This part is delicious. (And ingenious - why don't more restaurants do this?) The part that underwhelmed me was everything else with the dish, in particular the minimal seasoning in the duck and the potatoes. (I usually relish those rare opportunities when I order duck dishes, but this time around it was easy to forget that I was having duck.) So basically it was a duck hash dish where the duck and hash were pushed way to the back instead of being the highlight.And so it comes down to the awkward star-rating process. This would've been an easy choice if I could with half-stars, because then this would be 3.5 all the way. But since I'm forced to round to the nearest whole star I'm giving this place a 3 because if this were a movie cast I'd be disappointed by the main cast but impressed with the supporting actors.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,48,"Gourmet brunch anyone?! ME! I remember the very first time I was here, I almost missed LIC Market, if it wasn't for their outdoor seating and sign that points to the restaurant! Duh! -face palm!- In this fairly quiet neighborhood, all the sounds of joy and laughter can be found just by opening the doors to this tight, little spot. There is barely even a waiting area but from my past experiences here for brunch, table for two is usually about a fifteen-minutes wait. It is not bad at all, especially when you're about to experience some good food. Sunday Brunch:Duck Hash. The must-get dish at LIC Market. Generous amount of flavorful duck meat with red onions, peppers for fresh taste. Dried cherries and pine nuts adds an interesting sweet finish after each bite. Get it! Buttermilk Pancake. Warm, fluffy, and buttery. They were good just with the sugar powder on top of them! Skip the maple syrup, jam, and extra butter. Two Eggs Any Style. Do sunny side up! Comes with potatoes and small slices of bread. Simple dish but fresh tasting and it gives you the perfect opportunity to add on sides! Applewood Smoked-Bacon or Sausage Links are great choices!Applewood Smoked-Bacon. The taste of it still lingers in my mind. Thick cut texture, half chewy, half crunchy, and great amount of saltiness with just a tiny bit of sweetness. This is a side dish that I am guilty of ordering two plates of. Dirty Rice Frittata. Alright, I admit it. I was a bit skeptical about this dish. I am not a fan of chicken liver. I just closed my eyes and took a bite. To my surprise, I liked it! The rice was actually my favorite part as it absorbed all the spice and flavor from everything else.Slow Pulled Pork. Pulled Pork was really good! Nicely spiced up and marinated. Rice and beans was porky delicious, too! Chorizo and Eggs. Delicious combination of smokey sautéed chorizo in scrambled eggs. It comes with buttered toast and home fries on the side. Great choice for a brunch dish! Special Risotto of the Day: Risotto with Scallops, Zucchini, Tomato, and Basil. If you see this on the menu, don't wait until the next time - GET IT! The dish was full of the scallops' sweetness in every bite. Not to mention, generous amount of seared scallops overall. The vegetables and herbs gave the dish a colorful garden look that made it much more appetizing. I am very impressed with the risotto being able to hold the heat in until my very last bite. A perfectly well-done dish, love it! Lastly, brunch is not complete without mimosa and coffee. Orange Mimosa is light, bubbly, and sweet.

Well, it was about a few blocks away from our wonderful hotel. And we needed some grub pronto after dropping off our bags at the hotel...and needed some sustenance to keep us alive for the next 5 hours until our hotel room was actually ready.This place is super cute and tucked away. It looked like it used to be a home and is now converted into a cute little cafe. We were one of the few that were dining there that morning, not really a surprise since it was like a Wednesday morning. And our waiter was very friendly and quite personable, which both the SBBF and I enjoy. We both ordered the Bullseye Eggs which are basically 2 fried eggs inside slices of 7 grain bread and some home-style potatoes. Very delicious...but I think my eggs were cooked a bit too much, they were more over-hard than over-easy which is what I would have preferred on my dish.We really wanted to try some of the goodies they had by the bar, and by goodies I meant sweet treats!

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,56180,"Hidden gem of LIC--a must visit if you're ever in Queens. The restaurant is tucked away in the neighborhood and has 2 outdoor seatings and a lovely garden in the back. We were promptly seated and offered complimentary carrot cake (moist and delicious, by the way). Their wine and alcoholic beverages menu is much more extensive than their food menu; however the burger and the scallop risotto were both fantastic choices.Burgers: 5/5 ($14)One of the most juicy patties I've ever had in a burger. The meat is well seasoned and cooked medium rare to perfection. Buns were very chewy and a bit on the thinner side. I loved the aioli in the burger and asked for extra sauce on the side. TIP: Ask for their jalapeño house special sauce (they didn't have Tabasco) and mix it in with the aioli to get that extra kick in your burger.Home fries could be crispier but it was nice that they mixed in cilantro and red pepper in the medley. Overall good bang for your buck and delicious choice! Risotto: 4.5/5 I personally like my risotto cheeeeesy. Like pick up the spoon to see the strings of cheese oozing from the risotto cheesy. Their risotto could've used more cheese but I asked for extra Parmesan on the side so that I could put it in myself. Jam packed with creamy goodness with perfectly cooked asparagus! Rice was also cooked to perfection as I don't like the rice in my risotto too hard or too soft. Scallops were a bit dry .....but still tasty! Overall experience was great and they loaded the risotto with 4-5 solid pieces of scallops. Something you'll never find in the city for just $15.Loved my first visit here and will definitely be becoming back for more.From our stomach to yours,A&J",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.600000023842,12.1999998093,"gem,One,side,Queens,LIC,restaurant,back,garden,neighborhood,seatings,TIP,scallop risotto,Burgers,wine,menu,food menu,carrot cake,way,beverages,burger,Risotto,burger,kick,meat,aioli,risotto cheeeeesy,perfection,bit,sauce,sauce,aioli,risotto,risotto,A&J,choice,patties,Home fries,jalapeño house,burger,red pepper,cilantro,medley,bang,buck,experience,rice,perfection,goodness,asparagus,Tabasco,scallops,visit,risotto,risotto,pieces,stomach,more.,city,Rice,Buns,cheese,cheese,side,Scallops,strings,spoon,Parmesan,Jam","7,1,7,2,3,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1","0.103811249137,0.0972385331988,0.0493546649814,0.0425871983171,0.0425871983171,0.0342413112521,0.0342413112521,0.0342413112521,0.0342413112521,0.0342413112521,0.0270941350609,0.0205080099404,0.0186590831727,0.0159194767475,0.0148579254746,0.0148579254746,0.0130505850539,0.0130505850539,0.0130031751469,0.0126085272059,0.0125390766189,0.0125195691362,0.0112147796899,0.0107247438282,0.0103520220146,0.0102377384901,0.0100087886676,0.00998571421951,0.00996624585241,0.00994941219687,0.00994941219687,0.00943517964333,0.00933223310858,0.0091976262629,0.00909199099988,0.00878292601556,0.00870617013425,0.00870617013425,0.00809544045478,0.00796756986529,0.00796756986529,0.00796756986529,0.00795569270849,0.00795569270849,0.00704695656896,0.00692970957607,0.00675633037463,0.00591709371656,0.00591709371656,0.00515596941113,0.00513504771516,0.0042414884083,0.00410807970911,0.00410355068743,0.00408635055646,0.00408321153373,0.00408321153373,0.00408321153373,0.00400050077587,0.00378612987697,0.00343523034826,0.00326895550825,0.00326535082422,0.00321509968489,0.00270199240185,0.00260112946853,0.00153785839211,0.00153629784472"

LIC Market is one of the only places I've managed to do a sit down lunch so far. It's very unassuming with a small awning and a couple of stairs downstairs into a dimly lit room. The restaurant in fact stretches very far back and there's a surprising lovely backyard - I was lucky enough to grab a seat there once during nice weather when the roof was open. Now the roof is closed and backyard well insulated with heat lamps.The inside is very cozy and  it can get busy during prime lunch time. The two times I've come around noon I haven't had trouble getting a seat but have definitely witnessed people waiting for a table later. The décor is definitely interesting and it seems like most of the furniture is actually recycled from other materials or uses. One of my friends noticed that the large booth seats seem to similar to a church pew. The tables seemed like old concrete with interesting metal round pieces molded into them.The first time I had lunch there I ordered the market Burger. First things first - they do NOT have the option of fries here! My friend and I were so surprised and it almost deterred me from ordering the burger. But it did come with potato salad so I decided to give it a try. The burger was nothing special - satisfied me just enough but I wouldn't order it again. The best part of it was the bread which had caramelized onions on it. The potato salad was great - very creamy and  well-seasoned but in the end I wasn't sure how all of it really fit together... I left feeling satisfied but a little confused haha.The second time I went I had a bit more luck. I got the roasted chicken plate which came with broccolini, dried figs, and some bacon. First of all the portions were perfect! I was expecting a smaller portion for lunch but there was a very large and proportionate amount of chicken, veggies, figs and bacon. The chicken was delicious and juicy and the broccolini was cooked to just the right amount of crunchy vs chewiness. The dried figs was an interesting touch and I wasn't sure if I would enjoy all the flavors together but it ended up being a very great mash-up. The service has always been good - no complaints there. LIC Market gets 3 stars in my book for good food and good service but nothing to really crave or want to come back for.

It's in the middle of a quiet block in LIC and I was literally 2 storefronts away and still couldn't spot it, until my gf did. The place is pretty small, but it's really homey and comfy. We were seated immediately and the wait staff was prompt and friendly. The food was amazing though. I wanted to try 3-4 different things on the menu but eventually orderded the Slow Cooked Pork, which is one of the best brunch meals I've had in a while. They basically give you slow cooked prok, Indian rice and a fried egg, all mixed in a bowl. One might think that it doesn't sound like the tastiest dish ever, but it definitely hit the spot (especially after a night of drinking!). My gf's Pizza Bianca was equally mouthwatering;  thank god she let me steal a small piece! haha Even the bread basket they gave us to start off, which contained various types of bread, was really good.  LIC Market is definitely my ideal type of brunch spot: quiet, accommodating, delicious food, great service and good prices. Plus, it has a small little market in the front of the place with various prepared foods and goods andddddd it's within walking distance of 3 subway lines, so we made it back to Astoria in no time.

When she got there she said I have to hurry my babies outside. She was picking up food.  The bartender and I figured the babies probably outside with her husband.  When I watched her walk out she had a newborn infant in a stroller sitting outside in 30° weather by itself.  I would like to take this opportunity to point out the protocol  for going to pick up food at a restaurant with a newborn baby in a stroller.  When you get to the restaurant if you cannot drive the stroller inside you unstrap the baby  hold it in your arms and walk in  do whatever business you need to do  then you walk back outside and strap your baby back in the stroller.

In an area full of great low key places to go this one has my vote for one of the best! The place isn't the biggest and can get crowded on Sundays for brunch. If you prefer less of a crowd, Saturday might be better. I originally went on Sat.....the food was AWESOME! I liked it so much i went back the next day for Rd. 2! Again my fellow yelpers....im not a food snob...or 5 star critic judging the feeling of eggs and hash on my delicate pallet, but i do know good eating when i have it. This place has it! Forget the meal.....i would go back for the FREE carrot bread they serve while you are wait for your food! The bread must be popular.....they almost ran out of it on Sunday!  Considering how much it cost to eat out these days, the price was very cheap. Both days i never spent more than $40 for 2 people. The service was also very good.  They are attentive, polite, everything a server should be. Q borough stand up! You gave us NAS, 50 CENT, MOBB DEEP, LL COOL J, & now......The L.I.C. Market.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,55,"This has easily become one of my favorite restaurants, the food is amazing and the prices are fair. I know this place is a popular brunch spot, but I was blown away how much I liked their dinner. I say it was more a 4.5. If I had this restaurant in my neck of the woods, I would be here at least three times a week. The decor was warm and inviting, the service was courteous and pleasant and the food, the food was really great. Also, since I am an old fart, I really liked their playlist. I most definitely will be back for dinner and their brunch nom nom I love brunch! #bestmealoftheday I just had the brunch and I love this place, the food is on par with the dinner, me loves this place! The grapefruit mimosa is surprisingly really nice. The food:Dry Aged Ribeye- garlic fried potatoes, black truffle butter. It was like buttah, well there was butter on it but that's besides the point. I thought this steak was really nice, it was seasoned well, super tender and uber juicy. The fries were nice, they were steak fries, kinda like baked potato in a fry shape, I prefer it to be a tad bit more crunchy, but that's just me. Only small thing, I didn't get a sense of truffle in the butter. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Black Cod- shimenji, celeriac, african basil. Oh do I get giddy like a little girl when you make fish perfectly. LIC Market makes fish perfectly. It was crispy on the top and buttery and flaky on the bottom. The fish was so light and delicate and was seasoned perfectly. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Chorizo & Eggs- sautéed chorizo & red onion folded into soft scrambled eggs, home fries, toast. Oh mommy, this dish was great! The chorizo had great flavor and it didn't have that nasty greasy feeling chorizo normally does. The eggs were cooked nicely, they were fluffy and tender. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Buttermilk Pancakes- Housemade jam, toasted pumpkin seed butter & maple syrup. It was a very respectable pancake, it was light and airy with a nice pronounced butter flavor. I thought this was a good pancake but a little redundant, if that was all you ordered.Slow Roasted Duck Hash- diced potatoes, red onions, peppers, dried cherries & pine nuts with two fried eggs. I thought the flavor profile of this dish was so well thought out, it was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The eggs were perfectly runny, only criticism was the duck, while having great flavor, was on the dry side. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Heirloom Brussels Sprouts- applewood smoked bacon, red onion, chili oil. I thought this was an OK side. The sprouts were a little more moist than I would prefer in my sprouts, I like mine a little more roasted. Peach Crostata- pistachio, greek yogurt. This was a nice dessert. The peaches were cooked nicely and wasn't overly sweet and the dough had a nice chew kinda like a croissant. I dunno why but it reminded me of pizza. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Rum Chocolate Cake- coconut milk & pecan. I thought this was good, but too rich. The chocolate cake was really dense and really rich. I could only eat a few bites. The coconut milk was a nice addition, it made it feel very Thai. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",4,0,0.5,25.8999996185,"fart,brunch spot,food,restaurants,one,Chorizo,prices,dinner,flavor,pancake,dinner,decor,service,coconut milk,restaurant,dessert,woods,neck,Duck,steak,food,food,food,food,brunch,brunch,place,place,butter,grapefruit mimosa,pancake,brunch nom nom,black truffle butter,buttah,butter,playlist,steak fries,fish,par,thing,eggs,pumpkin seed butter,eggs,sense,fried potatoes,potato,dish,chorizo,feeling chorizo,red onion,home fries,truffle,Ribeye,point,juicy,fry shape,basil,celeriac,girl,bottom,fish,fish,toast,mommy,jam,maple syrup,flavor profile,red onion,sprouts,side,side,peaches,chili oil,bacon,greek yogurt,Buttermilk Pancakes,chocolate cake,Black Cod,LIC Market,milk,Heirloom Brussels Sprouts,dough,croissant,chew,pizza,pecan,bites,fried eggs,butter flavor,Peach Crostata,potatoes,red onions,sprouts,criticism,dish,Rum Chocolate Cake,pine nuts,cherries,peppers,Thai,eggs","1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7","0.358516603708,0.0733953565359,0.0425323434174,0.0277760904282,0.0275876577944,0.0239655207843,0.0228472370654,0.0185011588037,0.0184212736785,0.016297146678,0.0149477645755,0.0136945378035,0.0136945378035,0.0134264826775,0.0131465317681,0.01185615547,0.0115075986832,0.0115075986832,0.0113396644592,0.0101734129712,0.00766579061747,0.00751881720498,0.00629793992266,0.0062429192476,0.00613451609388,0.00589591404423,0.00569042982534,0.00569042982534,0.00552733195946,0.00533188180998,0.00522568169981,0.00499164639041,0.00463485298678,0.00462926086038,0.00461514107883,0.0044885086827,0.00444438448176,0.00436896923929,0.0043602976948,0.00427499320358,0.00421437993646,0.004194769077,0.00382432038896,0.00376626546495,0.00368872750551,0.00367648457177,0.00363206397742,0.00360136968084,0.00359702273272,0.0033460885752,0.0033460885752,0.00334087433293,0.00293552386574,0.00293197971769,0.00292874802835,0.00292577827349,0.00292047625408,0.00292047625408,0.00291808811016,0.00291373487562,0.00284583005123,0.00284364400432,0.00266277883202,0.00266113248654,0.00265663163736,0.00265663163736,0.00264613027684,0.00248818402179,0.00248608109541,0.0024101450108,0.00226408871822,0.00225852243602,0.00197993777692,0.00197993777692,0.00197746790946,0.00197644019499,0.00186472316273,0.00172892259434,0.00172618066426,0.00156246777624,0.00147290783934,0.00145747815259,0.00136792683043,0.00136792683043,0.00136742403265,0.00136693555396,0.00136554869823,0.00124905677512,0.00117675797082,0.00117049226537,0.00109272974078,0.00109272974078,0.00107655290049,0.00103740917984,0.000993349356577,0.00092478870647,0.000869431358296,0.000869431358296,0.000869431358296,0.000807952892501,0.000540231005289"

They don't advertise the fact that all and I mean ALL their wines are biodynamic or that their carrots are heirloom and other little details that other restaurants like to front. It seems to me that they just want to invite you to their humble abode and share their great food and wine. The service was so welcoming, kind, had a sense of humor, they were all wonderful. Like everything else in the restaurant should, they enhanced my meal experience, it wasn't just service it was warm comfortable hospitality, the kind that seems effortless really. It may be the American thing to do an entree as the entire meal, with perhaps splitting an appetizer and/or dessert. Don't be like that, you're going out to eat, enjoy food, don't skimp and whatever you do, do not skip the snacks! The Olivade was addicting especially spread over the country bread. Ugh! I mean, I don't enjoy olives but this creamy paste made with crushed olives, ricotta, and olive oil, served with raw veggies (carrots) was so good. The scallops with a hybrid grapefruit and pea shoots were absolutely delicious and went well with the glass of Cava we started out with. All the sides were good, I did a tasting of sides as well as wines. The caramelized carrots, the Himalayan red rice and the fries were great. And I don't care how full you are, try the pecan cake with chocolate which is absolutely divine.

Was most impressed by our legendary waitress, Jessica, who was one of the best ever. I have a lot of food allergies which render me basically allergic to breakfast and brunch. Jessica took on the challenge with aplomb and managed to have the kitchen whip me up something damn tasty and palatable (brisket over rice and beans, yum!). Least sad brunch I've ever had! The food came SUPER fast (like lightning) and they have a nice dining area out back. Will come again!My co-diners appreciated the décor of suspended tree branches and suspended shelves. Had to knock off half a star for zero gluten free bread options but they're a small place and I understand the hazards of making gluten free stock orders that people don't end up ordering.

I had the ""Any Style"" eggs and he had the slow cooked pork.I loved the home fries that came with my plate. The eggs were excellent and fresh. We traded plates after a few bites as he is not a fan of beans and didn't read the menu properly (thought it was just rice!) and the slow cooked pork is.. just awesome.  Juicy and flavorful and I really liked the rice/beans. I love potatoes though so I was grabbing the home fries off the other plate. I probably ate 2/3 of what we ordered.Definitely a place to go back to eventually. It was inexpensive at $20 (before tip) in all and the service was friendly w/o being pushy.

It was a bit crowded when we first stepped in and were told there would be about a 20-minute wait. Many people started wrapping up a couple minutes into our wait was only probably 10 minutes. My friends got the slow cooked pork and shirred eggs, while I got the duck hash. I wished I got the pork because my duck hash was a bit dried and hard to chew. The hash was okay. The touch of dried cherries was a bit out of the ordinary and I can't judge if the enhanced the dish or not, although I didn't mind them. Also, a tip if you're a hot sauce lover, ask them for hot sauce. I attest that their hot sauce is actually decently spicy and really accentuates the flavors of the meat.I wish I had a chance to see the interior seating area since we were seated at the bar which was cool. I love me a rustic-themed shop so bonus points in my book for their decor.

Inside LIC market are great peices of art that I would probably consider decorating my own apartment with and they add a lot of charm to the dining area. The menu is seasonal and offers a few, yet hard to choose, dishes. My friend and I decided split our entrees to maximize our tastings and upon the recommendation of our amazing server, Gina, narrowed our dishes down to the squab and the burger. We started with the razor clams since their days on the menu were numbered. They came in a delicious broth with a green sauce that begged to slurped with a spoon; not wanting to look like savages, we settled for sopping up the broth with chunks of crusty bread. I ordered the burger, cooked medium rare, and it came with a side of oyster mushroom and truffle hash. The burger was dripping with deliciousness. The hash had the perfect amount of truffle to not be over powering. The squab was cooked to perfection and brought out the savages in us as we cleaned bones with our teeth! The squab was atop a bed of the most delicious brussel sprouts and bacon i have ever tasted. If the food werent enough, we were there before 7pm when wine and beer was half price. As i was midway through my IPA, i ordered a 2nd one at 6:55 so as not to miss the deal. Gina was so awesome that she placed the drink order for me and kept it cold till i was ready to drink it. Already reaching the FULL mark in our bellies, we spied to our right, a table with a dessert that looked too good to pass up. When Gina told us the three offerings for dessert, we ended up ordering two... like the greedy kids we are. Apple fritters dusted with cinnamon sugar with a whipped cream for dipping. And a blueberry crumble with cream anglaise. i dont know how... but we managed to eat it all. And it was great. Dont just come here for the food. The service is fantastic as is the location.

It's topped with 2 over easy eggs so the moment you cut into this dish the yolk gets everywhere. I know, perfect right? Topped off the meal with a side of bacon which was a nice crispy thick cut.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,2104,"One of the gems of hood, LIC Market has become a mainstay for my brunch cravings and casual dinner outings. The food is more or less Americana, but with an atypical approach and delicious execution. It is certainly one of the best spots in LIC and deserves some recognition for being a great addition to the area.The restaurant itself is small, even tight by some standards, but cosy enough when its a part of three or less. It's close enough to several train lines and is tucked away along 44th without any ambiguous signage. Service has been courteous with every visit and I've never had to wait long for food.Speaking of food, it was because of brunch I came to know this place. After 20+ visits, my choices here basically depended on my mood. If I felt like actual breakfast, I'd shoot for their fritata of the day ($8) or perhaps a chorizo scramble ($8). Something I hadn't had for brunch before was their slow cooked pork, almost like carnitas with black beans over long grain rice, all of which was very tasty. The liver and eggs is an acquired taste, but certainly worth ordering for organ lovers. Aim for the duck hash for something fun, delicious, but not too hearty.And to all night eaters, LIC Market finally opened its doors to dinner service not too long ago. The market burger ($15) feels somewhat different from the ($12) brunch version, but is still equally flavorful and juicy. I am definitely a fan of the risotto ($15) and the Jamison lamb ($23), both of which are uber savory and very pleasing to the palate. I haven't been on the fish bandwagon as much with their sockeye salmon ($23), but I can vouch for their east coast halibut ($23): flakey, succulent, and fabulous.And just because there is a menu doesn't mean you have to follow it. One of the best things about LIC Market is their interesting random daily specials. It's like an experiment of food apart from their regular line up, all of which is worth entertaining. LIC novices in small groups, should absolutely consider this joint for a delicious bite.",4.0 star rating,"Queens, New York, NY",3,0,0.800000011921,12.8999996185,"fan,LIC Market,all,mainstay,LIC Market,gems,hood,brunch cravings,dinner outings,food,one,Something,liver,restaurant,execution,approach,recognition,spots,Americana,Service,black beans,doors,train lines,addition,standards,part,signage,food,brunch,brunch,things,visit,visits,dinner service,something,place,mood,choices,chorizo scramble,fritata,breakfast,carnitas,grain rice,organ lovers,eggs,night eaters,duck hash,market burger,menu,lamb,sockeye salmon,coast,halibut,fish bandwagon,food,specials,line,novices,experiment,groups,joint,bite,brunch version,palate,risotto,both,Jamison","1,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,1,1","0.474612116814,0.0450252704322,0.0386464707553,0.0286394637078,0.0281310211867,0.0252792388201,0.0252792388201,0.0252792388201,0.0252792388201,0.0199622325599,0.0187004618347,0.015049639158,0.0145546142012,0.0143253840506,0.0121020162478,0.0121020162478,0.0120403692126,0.0120403692126,0.00890271645039,0.00825090054423,0.00782406982034,0.00577515549958,0.00524980947375,0.00461109448224,0.00461109448224,0.00461109448224,0.00459433998913,0.00418364768848,0.00418364768848,0.00415883446112,0.00368397589773,0.00353619665839,0.00352804269642,0.00320795783773,0.00320795783773,0.00309427571483,0.00308713898994,0.00308713898994,0.00308111775666,0.00308111775666,0.00308111775666,0.00307591143064,0.00307591143064,0.00281073548831,0.00281073548831,0.00280698668212,0.00280698668212,0.00280359969474,0.00259290658869,0.00233957241289,0.00209043943323,0.00209043943323,0.00209043943323,0.00209043943323,0.0019541552756,0.00179382029455,0.00165138603188,0.00149958347902,0.00144480285235,0.00144362112042,0.00144362112042,0.00144362112042,0.00091890420299,0.000917890749406,0.000917890749406,0.000861493870616,0.000543272763025"

The yolks would arrive solid in the past, over done, and now they're correct. They also used to brown steak at temps too high, so that the meat would taste bitter.

Well my friends, I did it! It was the buttermilk pancakes of all things. From the first bite, the eyebrow on my right shot for the stratosphere and hung ten for a while. And too my  surprise, not only was it raised, I felt the arch. It was a reaction to the grand wondrous curiosity on my plate. Nothing, tricky or highly ""artful""; it was just made with the love you could only get from a country kitchen. I wanted to run back into the kitchen and scream, ""Grandma!!"" as I burst through the saloon doors and likely scare the people cooking my food. [I looked on my way out.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,27677,"Came here to celebrate Valentine's Day last Friday after failing to come here after nearly a year and a half in the area and I'm certainly glad I did!  We showed up promptly at 6PM to avoid the rush of couples celebrating the day, as LIC Market was not taking reservations.  We were promptly seated in the back dining area, which was about half full at that point, and waited on right away.  By the time we left, at about 7:15, the restaurant was more-or-less full and a wait was starting to form; I'm not sure how that compares to a regular weekend night, but based on our experience, it seems like coming in before 6:30/7 is the way to avoid a wait.  One more quick comment about the seating; it's a little tight back there.  If you want to have a private conversation, this probably isn't the best place; we were squeezed pretty tightly in between two couples and could easily hear their conversations without trying to eavesdrop.  I'm sure the same could be said for our discussions.The service was also well above average.  Our server (and other servers on the floor) were attentive and paced the ordering perfectly, answered any questions we had about the menu in detail, and refilled our waters with little wait on the numerous occasions we ran dry.  The appetizer we ordered came very quickly and there was a near-perfect amount of time in between the first dish and our mains.As for the most important part of the meal, the food itself?  The flavors in both the appetizer and the main dish were fantastic overall.  We started with the carrots, which  were extremely flavorful and prepared in a way which made me forget momentarily that I actually hate carrots.  There was a very light char on them and the almonds served as the perfect compliment.  For our mains, we both ended up ordering the halibut, which was cooked to perfection and served with a delicious celeriac sauce and Japanese turnips.  I personally didn't feel that the turnips fit with the dish quite right and would have liked to see some other ingredient incorporated to add a bit of color, but it was a minor complaint that certainly did not shadow the taste of the fish or the sauce.  The only other thing really holding this back from being a five-star review (I give it a 4.5-ish rating) is the portion size.  The dishes are certainly worth the price, but I felt that there could have been slightly more on the plate for both the appetizer and the main course.  I certainly wouldn't hesitate in coming back to the restaurant for this reason, but to leave feeling full would probably require each person to have his/her own appetizer, main, and perhaps even a dessert.I'm very glad I finally got to come check out LIC Market and look forward to visiting them again for brunch in the near future!",4.0 star rating,"ASTORIA, NY",3,0,0.5,10.8000001907,"dining area,half,area,Valentine's Day,portion size,reservations,couples,LIC Market,rush,comment,couples,way,wait,complaint,way,restaurant,service,point,appetizer,experience,almonds,wait,servers,wait,place,dish,dish,appetizer,amount,turnips,carrots,conversation,conversations,char,taste,carrots,seating,same,average,discussions.,occasions,waters,detail,menu,questions,floor,appetizer,meal,part,food,dishes,sauce,halibut,fish,review,back,price,plate,appetizer,mains.As,person,server,restaurant,rating,course,reason,dessert.,brunch,dish,flavors,compliment,celeriac sauce,mains,ingredient,perfection,bit,Japanese","2,2,2,5,7,7,1,7,4,5,1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.0990020409226,0.069189697504,0.069189697504,0.0647060275078,0.0503922738135,0.034132823348,0.0330915376544,0.0315183848143,0.0289718732238,0.0219146814197,0.0214651972055,0.020508999005,0.0194206852466,0.0173608697951,0.0155692817643,0.0149894626811,0.0110516063869,0.0110272113234,0.0109888752922,0.0109871178865,0.0109734088182,0.00932195410132,0.00924047268927,0.00924047268927,0.00915494654328,0.00908771809191,0.00907559879124,0.00907559879124,0.00876843836159,0.00847796164453,0.00845717638731,0.00843586213887,0.00843586213887,0.00799517333508,0.00787911750376,0.00766090955585,0.00739823654294,0.00736676296219,0.00736676296219,0.00736676296219,0.00735430931672,0.00735430931672,0.00735430931672,0.00735430931672,0.00735430931672,0.00735430931672,0.00674120895565,0.00672003999352,0.00672003999352,0.00672003999352,0.00632731523365,0.00570652028546,0.00558751961216,0.00499272393063,0.00498835928738,0.00498835928738,0.0049842800945,0.0049842800945,0.00466411933303,0.00454757921398,0.00432149460539,0.00400343537331,0.00394131010398,0.00354234711267,0.00345081579871,0.00344816409051,0.00344816409051,0.00344816409051,0.00296208891086,0.00290675112046,0.00250781513751,0.00250527076423,0.00250527076423,0.00227459124289,0.00219172774814,0.00218966859393,0.0012971512042"

And I HATE more then anything when restaurants try to be cute or push there food and drink agenda on me. For example if a restaurant says order all at once and you like an item and want another its too late. Not here just an example of what I am trying to point out here at LIC Market.NO WINE GLASSES, one like myself that respects the reason why Reidel glasses have different shapes and sizes is b/c say you order a nice bottle of Champagne it goes in a tall thin glass the way it hits your pallet. Or order a nice bold Red Wine like a Cab or Bordeaux, even a nice Pinot u need a big round glass and trust me you can tell the difference. That reason alone I will not go back to this dive tucking there pardons in the back of a dark square box and spend the $ just go to NYC and hit at hundreds of better managed restaurants.As for the food I ordered the Rabbit and as you can see the picture i posted looks good, however even as good as I am at taking food pictures what the outside doesn't tell you is how dry and flaky the rabbit meat was on the inside. Why? simple they do NOT serve the breast of the rabbit which is the best part. For excellent Rabbit the best I've ever had go to Gramercy Tavern they now how to cook game. My wife had risotto again this fell flat on its face. I am sorry folks, I don't want to be rude but that's why I am here to give honest advice and save people some money. I can make better risotto again why? b/c i cook it longer and stir it more. It takes time to execute a perfect risotto and this was more like hard thick rice awful. As for the atmosphere and service I'm not impressed and location is not worth trying to get to this hole in the wall on the edge of LIC not even on the water or in a decent neighborhood. We had to take a cab from our apt and we live in LIC overall bad experience.

LIC Market is conveniently located right next to the subway station. It has a quaint homey feel. If the stars don't align, you will probably have to wait a good 20-30 minutes. The wait staff is generally on their game though and are very nice. Notice how I haven't talked about the food?  That's cause you'll forget it the moment you walk out the door. It's all pretty okay tasting but straightforward and rather uninteresting. Duck hash had a nice bit of sweetness. The slow cooked pork was literally a pile of fairly salty meat which, don't get me wrong, is right up my alley. Just don't expect to be wowed. Sake Bloody Mary tasted like a regular ol Bloody Mary to me but everyone says it's da bomb so I must be crazy, right??On the other hand, the coffee was stellar so after going 4 cups deep I left the place skipping to music that wasn't there. I might've also pissed my pants. I live fairly close so I could definitely see this place as a regular haunt.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,4879,"VROOM! VROOOOM!Hear that? That's the engine of an Aston Martin aka the Market Burger. Just about everything that's on it is an instant classic.  The bread, the cheese, the meat, the aioli... it's a simple burger that doesn't try to do anything too fancy (ok, maybe the aioli is a bit fancy) and stays true to the basics. Starting with the onion bun, to the perfectly cooked meat and ending with the deeply sharp cheddar - there wasn't a single thing about it that I didn't love. I shared the burger with my wife and had half of her skirt steak. Probably one of the best skirt steaks I've ever head - certainly don't remember any Cuban place that served up skirt steak this good. Then again, I've never been to Cuba but in the meantime this will do just fine.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,13532,"Aw shoot. I really want to like LICM. She is that first date who took a giant fart during dinner and embarrassed you. And you, being a shallow asshat, refused to give her a second chance, even though deep inside, you know she is still a wonderful girl. That was my experience in LIC Market. I've wanted to try this place for a really long time and I confidently picked this place, entirely out of my way, as the brunch rendezvous for an endearing reunion. The staff was very friendly. The bartender made us feel extremely comfortable with his welcoming smiles while we waited to be seated. Once we sat down, the simple but mouth-watering menu took over our attention and paved ways to what felt like a beginning of a 5 star experience. It was a downhill pavement.Lucy and I elected for the shredded pork, blackbeans, fried eggs with white rice. The white rice was done extremely well, almost like what you find in expensive korean bbq. The pork, although a bit dry, was still pretty good. We also picked two sides: the broccolini (which was somewhat like Chinese broccoli), and the home fries. The problem? Our sides did not come. We worked on our entrees, still believing in the super nice staff. Our entree got cold but our awaited sides still did not come. I waved down our waiter, who owned up with a ""that was totally my fault,"" and told us it'll be a few minutes. He never entered our order... and of course it took much longer than just a couple of minutes. The sides were delicious. Home fries were one of the best brunch potatoes I've had and the broccolini tasted clean and homey. Then we encountered the second hiccup. We noticed that other tables have gotten fancy breads and we then realized we have never received bread service! We twiddled our thumbs. We were full by that time and I contemplated about just letting them off the hook. Lucy told me the bread was worth it. I asked for them.Several apologies later, we got our generous serving of bread (which includes choco croissant and carrot cake!) ""This can be your dessert!"" joked the waitress. LICM, your food was really good but I cannot in good faith give you a good rating. Your service mishaps cut into the brunch experience. Conversations about more important subjects (online hookup apps equals good idea) turned to sour confusion about your service. If we have gotten bread to begin with, we would not have needed to order additional sides, and then having to sample your ""desserts"" with our already-full stomachs.How much should service matter?A full 3 stars worth. Will I be back to give LICM a second try like my heart tells me to?

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,23867,"This place is awesome! I came for brunch last weekend. For starters, the wait staff is amazing... friendly and professional. You get seated with a smile. Then you get a nice plate of breads which included 2 chocolate croissants, 2 pieces of carrot cake and 2 pieces of bread all fresh, all delicious. My 4 year old son begged for more chocolate croissants so they gave us 2 more free. The food was excellent! I had eggs with corned beef. Not corned beef hash, but nice thick slices of Katz's Deli quality corned beef. I also had mimosa and a coffee. Both very good. My wife had the frittata special. It is not cheap but you get good food, good service and a really nice experience. It can be tough to get a table and there can be lines but we came on a snow day and had no wait. 1/2 the restaurant is on an enclosed patio with heat lamps but it was 20 degrees out and people were out there without sweaters on. I can't say enough about the experience. It was great! The only negative is that they don't have a liqueur license so no traditional bloody mary, but they do have mimosa's and saki bloody mary's and the restaurant is small so it is really tight in there.

Had a fantastic night at LIC Market, all thanks to the amazing staff!  I made a reservation for 9 people on a Friday for a surprise bridal celebration dinner.  They only accept reservations for dinner for larger groups, which worked out well for me.  In addition to calling, I also visited the day before my party plans to get a feel of the space for decorations.  The waitress was very welcoming and allowed me to peruse, as they were not super busy on a Thursday night.  I fell in love with the patio, and the waitress made sure to note that spot in my reservation.  The semi-outdoor, semi-private patio had fairy lights, potted plants, and heat lamps which kept us just warm enough on a ~45F night--it was perfect.On the night of, a gentleman led me to our table which was prepared perfectly: yellow tulips, candles, napkins, etc.  They allowed me to set up my own decorations of balloons, a banner, and party favors.  As my party arrived, the only person left was the bride to be surprised.  I let the hostess know, and she was very enthusiastic to help carry out the surprise and she let her team know as well.  Needless to say, the surprise was very successful.  The waitress kindly gave us time to take a ton of pictures.  She was never overbearing or absent, just perfect.  Later, she willingly explained each Main on the menu.  The appetizers were delicious: octopus, mushrooms, fries, fig+rice.  Everyone's main course was brought out at the same time, including one latecomer's which was great.  I also noticed that they tried their best to let us have the patio to ourselves, since I didn't book out the room, but dining with others was still pleasant.  We never felt rushed, even though we stayed quite a few hours chatting.At the end of the night, I was so preoccupied that I put a 20% tip, on top of a 20% tip that was already included on the check for our large group.  I received a call soon after, and the waitress knew it must have been a mistake and only charged me for the original receipt amount.  If I had the monies, I would have left it since they totally deserve a 40% tip!Many thanks to the accommodating staff at LIC Market for such a memorable night!!!",5.0 star rating,"Fresh Meadows, NY",3,0,0.5,12.5,"groups,group dinner,environment,place,reservation,celebration dinner,reservations,dinner,waitress,thanks,staff,person,people,LIC Market,patio,hostess,table,waitress,heat lamps,tip,gentleman,feel,mistake,party,patio,decorations,addition,space,love,waitress,surprise,reservation,party,surprise,monies,decorations,ton,spot,napkins,candles,tulips,plants,fairy lights,banner,party favors,balloons,pictures,menu,octopus,group,tip,call,check,top,end,tip,Main,thanks,staff,latecomer,course,team,receipt amount,waitress,appetizers,patio,fig,rice,fries,mushrooms,Everyone,others,best,room","3,4,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,3,7,1,7,1,6,7,1,7,7,3,2,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,5,7,7,5,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,7,6,7,1,1,7,2","0.0839513912797,0.0692761167884,0.0552991256118,0.0487847626209,0.0330106578767,0.0330106578767,0.0328913070261,0.0328913070261,0.0316174775362,0.0301966760308,0.0301966760308,0.0287176463753,0.0263044945896,0.023506404832,0.022851748392,0.0210422743112,0.0170861165971,0.0161018706858,0.0154427913949,0.0145254721865,0.0139914033934,0.0128821898252,0.0127913895994,0.0125638013706,0.0125104328617,0.0114292642102,0.0100016016513,0.0100016016513,0.00995909050107,0.00956654828042,0.00917034968734,0.00844995863736,0.0084118777886,0.00840173009783,0.00800057221204,0.0076618087478,0.00710919266567,0.00672538485378,0.00671401713043,0.00671401713043,0.00671401713043,0.00671401713043,0.00671401713043,0.00670400587842,0.00670400587842,0.00670400587842,0.00610651960596,0.00609545735642,0.00609047478065,0.00570571376011,0.00570571376011,0.00465417234227,0.00454062083736,0.00454062083736,0.00454062083736,0.00394572177902,0.00360900908709,0.00358875631355,0.00358875631355,0.00356492795981,0.00352871417999,0.00337278237566,0.00314169214107,0.00283228466287,0.0026381178759,0.00250458647497,0.00199582846835,0.00199582846835,0.00199582846835,0.00199582846835,0.00199429434724,0.00199284916744,0.00191844685469,0.00180056178942"

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,6416,"I came with a friend to this place. It was amazing. We chose to sit outside, since it was a beautiful day and I didn't make a mistake there. I could see inside though and it looked a bit small, so I don't think that this place would be the greatest for larger groups. Maybe four max. The food was great. We got a bunch of different types of bread/pastries to try for free at the start of the meal. They came with different types of butters and jams as well. Delicious. My friend is a beast at eating food, so we each ordered an entree and then another entree for us to share. That was our only mistake. The entrees are HUGE. We both struggled to finish our first entree and barely touched the one we were to share. I feel like when you come to fancier restaurants like this, you expect their portions to be small, so I was VERY pleased that these portions were a good size. I ordered the duck hash since that seemed to be popular here on yelp, and to be honest, it was a little dry, but still very good. My friend had some kind of pulled pork dish which was also very good.

Regardless, we were seated in about 5 minutes.The food was very good. We split the soft egg salad to start, which was truly amazing. We then shared the duck hash and shirred egg. Both were very good, however a little bit too heavy for a hot summer day. The flavors just worked and everything was cooked perfectly with all of the right textures.The ambiance was also very nice, however a little bit too packed. It felt like a Brooklyn cafe.What we did not like is that on an 80 degree day we were seated on the back patio which must have been over 90 degrees for some unknown reason. on top of that, the stone tables and very hot food made it feel that much more hot. Consequently, we left the restaurant uncomfortably sweaty.All in all, I would go again.

It came with home fries. I have also had the slow cooked duck hash and tried the slow coked pork that was sandwiched between black beans with rice and two fried eggs.

LIC Market sounded more like a place with a food buffet. However, the great ratings and proximity sealed the deal.You can imagine our surprise when it turned out to be a full service restaurant with an ambiance I was not anticipating. The interiors were all dark woods and the candlelit tables, spacious outdoor seating, and hanging jade plants made us feel tremendously underdressed in our tank tops and shorts. We quickly got seated and placed our orders.We went right for the entrees and I settled on the market burger. Now for the disappointing parts of the meal. 20 minutes after ordering, I noticed the tables around us all had bread and olive oil. I had to ask our server to give us a plate because I guess he forgot. I needed to ask for our water bottle to be refilled three times. Our food, just two burgers and a steak, took over 40 minutes to prepare. By the time the food arrived, our bread was well past demolished and we were famished.The food itself was okay: not bad by any means but definitely not worth that wait. I appreciated how the burger was cooked to my liking and how the cheese was completely melted over. The bun was a toasty garlic brioche and the crunch gave the burger a nice texture. The garlic fries could've been seasoned a little more or at least had more garlic added, but at least they felt substantial and not over fried.I'm almost never in LIC, but I think I'll be trying another place for a post Warm Up snack. However, if you're in the area, it seems like a nice place for a date. Just be wary that the burger is cheapest entree and all the $20-$30 entrees looked minuscule.

I had a typical mild fall cold complete with sniffles, and both arms were still sore from recent travel vaccinations. The cloudy October day completed the gloomy picture, and the only way to feel comforted in a sea of malaise was to seek out some soup. Unfortunately, the lunch options near my office were stubbornly hopeless. A watered down chicken noodle broth from the deli would not suffice. I had to think outside the box. I had to go to LIC Market.It was there that I was able to find a toasty, seasonal butternut squash soup, garnished with pepitas. The flavors were complex and satisfying, and wrapped around me like a winter coat. As I looked around the busy restaurant at other cheerful LIC workers, I felt glad that I could finally have what the majority of this city's workers have: a reasonably priced, charming cafe, where you can have a quick seated lunch, lust longingly at the wine list, grab a creative American sandwich or soup, and remove yourself from the doom and gloom of your office.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.0,7.09999990463,"neighborhood restaurant,Long Island City,butternut squash soup,cafe,picture,sniffles,travel vaccinations,cold,chicken noodle broth,soup,way,office,sea,malaise,deli,box,pepitas,lunch,city,workers,majority,arms,soup,LIC Market.It,office,lust,wine list,sandwich,doom,gloom,lunch options,flavors,LIC workers,restaurant,winter coat,American","2,2,7,2,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,2,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,2","0.122397705913,0.0729570016265,0.0495384074748,0.0474617779255,0.0439425185323,0.0408340618014,0.0408340618014,0.0408340618014,0.0395813435316,0.0345855727792,0.0328730717301,0.0314071215689,0.0275440383703,0.0275440383703,0.027444075793,0.0274032540619,0.0250492896885,0.0213487576693,0.0213487576693,0.0213487576693,0.0179869811982,0.0177328009158,0.0162592995912,0.0148446159437,0.014790260233,0.0129418941215,0.0129418941215,0.0129418941215,0.0129418941215,0.0129418941215,0.0119249662384,0.0108507312834,0.00937413331121,0.00937413331121,0.00821087136865,0.00766406161711"

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,16650,"Quietly sitting underneath the tracks of the 7 train is LIC Market. A welcome addition to this usually dull part of Long Island City.  The space is charming and quaint*, bright and inviting, much resembling a farmhouse out in the stix - Vermont perhaps and the cool, wet weather on a June night, completed this image. In an effort to refrain from over ordering, our party had to narrow it down to a a few dishes we felt would provide us the best sampling of the menu. There's nothing new or exciting about a crisp, shredded endive salad, or pleasantly chewy baby octopus atop some vegetables. But what's wonderful is being able to taste the contrast between the sweet tomatoes and savory tentacles. Or the nutty grana padano against the bitter endives and peppery arugula, brought together by the sweet aged balsamic vinegar. The Market Burger satisfies the need for comfort food and is done well here - cooked medium rare and served with a tasty caramelized onion bun.  I'm probably one of the few that doesn't care much for the truffle potato and oyster mushroom hash but that wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. The liver and eggs, a little bit of gluttony, with creamy scrambled eggs and seared chunks of foie gras, would be welcomed in my breakfast plate daily but I'm glad it's offered here for dinner. The sleeper star of the night has to be the spaghetti. As boring as the dish sounds, the colorful array of roasted young corn, zucchini, red onion, and jalapeno mixed into the pasta and the sweetness from those fresh vegetables made this a beautiful dish to see and devour. For dessert the silky Creme Caramel satiated the craving for a light ending however the granola tasted stale - whoops! But rustic allows for little imperfections here and there and this is one I can forgive. Refreshingly simple, fresh food, as served here, is a much needed break from the trendy, the fusion, the cool, and the over hyped. Seasonal, local ingredients are highlighted here too and although some may argue that that in itself is a jump onto a bandwagon, I feel LIC Market does a fantastic job letting the natural freshness and taste of these components revel in the spotlight. This should be the norm rather than the trend. -------------------------------------* limited seats + no reservations = expect a short wait",4.0 star rating,"Queens, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,10.5,"one,train,tracks,LIC Market,space,part,liver,break,addition,weather,farmhouse,Long Island City,Vermont,dishes,few,party,vegetables,one,image,menu,ordering,effort,baby octopus,endive salad,sampling,endives,dish,comfort food,eggs,eggs,spaghetti,sleeper star,red onion,contrast,tomatoes,tentacles,balsamic vinegar,arugula,grana padano,need,onion bun,oyster mushroom hash,truffle potato,gluttony,bit,array,foie gras,chunks,dinner,breakfast plate,corn,jalapeno,zucchini,jump,some,fusion,cool,bandwagon,ingredients,Market Burger,norm,spotlight,components,taste,freshness,job,trend,reservations,dish,vegetables,granola,seats,sweetness,pasta,light,craving,dessert,Creme Caramel,imperfections","1,7,5,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,7,7,3,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7","0.136585503817,0.0607943497598,0.0607943497598,0.0517699420452,0.0354084298015,0.033227622509,0.0295387767255,0.0293523743749,0.029097110033,0.0289488565177,0.0289488565177,0.0172683354467,0.0171800944954,0.0138728125021,0.0136146638542,0.0134445196018,0.0125850252807,0.0122392270714,0.0119593050331,0.0110447071493,0.0110447071493,0.0110447071493,0.0110135637224,0.0110135637224,0.00846651941538,0.00846464186907,0.00845829211175,0.00845034141093,0.00842649769038,0.00842649769038,0.00825357902795,0.00804716534913,0.00769388442859,0.00742121553048,0.00742121553048,0.00742121553048,0.00740673998371,0.00740673998371,0.00740673998371,0.00739422347397,0.00739422347397,0.00738320080563,0.00738320080563,0.00737335486338,0.00737335486338,0.00708205625415,0.00674771796912,0.00674771796912,0.00674771796912,0.00674771796912,0.00673215091228,0.00673215091228,0.00673215091228,0.00621669040993,0.00572827178985,0.00501603679731,0.00501603679731,0.00501193571836,0.00501193571836,0.00437868013978,0.0042473054491,0.0034702338744,0.0034702338744,0.0034702338744,0.0034702338744,0.0034702338744,0.00346756749786,0.00346505572088,0.00277297175489,0.00252204784192,0.00251948926598,0.00230935029685,0.00220644054934,0.00220644054934,0.00220420188271,0.00220420188271,0.00220420188271,0.00220420188271,0.00220213108696"

I appreciated that, and I appreciated them too.Next, our lovely waitress brought out crack. Literally.

The happy hour is pretty good. You get a variety of drinks to choose from - white wine, red wine, beer. There aren't too many happy hour beers, but on the regular menu, they have a good selection (they're just a bit expensive). I love how they chill the glass for you before pouring the beer. Now onto the food. LIC Market has been bookmarked for months, and I had been dying to try this place! Unfortunately, while the service was awesome, the food was a bit disappointing. I ordered the risotto, and we shared the spaghetti squash. The risotto was good, but nothing spectacular. The spaghetti squash, however, was not my cup of tea.

Food is unbelievably tasty, prices are totally fair, and service is always friendly. Sake bloody mary highly recommended, even if you're not a huge Sake fan (I find it grows on you as you make your way through the drink). Also recommend the shredded pork and rice with the egg on top--add some green hot sauce to it. The shirred eggs are hit-or-miss; sometimes the lentils are a bit runny for my liking.Best part is how they give you free pastries when you sit down to tide you over till the meal comes!! Awesome! The carrot cake is moist and fabulous.Make sure you sit out in their heated patio--it's charming and unique.My only complaint (which might be a positive for some people) is that the experience is generally quite rushed. They take your order quickly, bring your food very quickly, and you get your check quickly. In and out in sub-40 minutes every time. Given that it's usually just my partner and I going for brunch, we don't mind since we're looking for food more than anything, but if I was going for a ""special occasion"" brunch with a big group of friends, perhaps you want to hold off ordering for a little bit since the food comes out right away.One of only a handful of restaurants in NY that I go to regularly and don't feel guilty about not trying somewhere new.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,6908,"** 4.5 stars **LIC Market is an unassuming gem of an establishment.  Easy enough to miss from the outside, its low-key sign blends into the building it is housed in.  Step through the heavy front doors and you'll be transported into a charming space that could easily be a simple, rustic home.  They serve foods that evoke very much the same reaction, with great emphasis on seasonal and local.The entry section functions as its name suggests, with rough-hewn shelves displaying an assortment of housemade sauces, jams, and foodstuffs marinated or pickled, teas, and handmade goods like greeting cards, all for sale.  It is also where its very inviting bar area is, serving excellent coffee by day, more potent stuff from their well-curated wine and beer list by night.  During brunch, fresh-baked goods may be purchased to go.Further down a hall is the cozy dining room.  Natural light floods through curtained windows and a door that seems to step out into a small backyard.  Simple paintings and photos of urban scenes adorn the walls.  The wait staff fit right in; friendly yet unobtrusive, and efficient.  The whole works.  It is too small a space not to sometimes feel too close to other diners, or to have to do some navigation to get out, but there is a vibe here that makes you feel neighborly.The compact, ever-changing menu reflects LIC Market's focus on seasonal ingredients, and its never been quite the same at each of my three visits over just one month.  It is justifiably known for brunch, where classics get proper treatment with quality ingredients and great execution.  It starts with a superb complimentary baked goods plate; that moist carrot cake and flaky pastry were surely signs of what was to come.  Slow-cooked pork was succulent, falling apart over black beans and rice, topped with two fantastically fresh fried eggs.  Hash was well-played substituting duck and using dried cherries and pine nuts to add an interesting dimension.  And the earthy ""Dirty Rice"" frittata was hearty and just plain good; while I am inclined to think that liver can improve just about anything, I think it works wonderfully here without asserting itself too much.  Breakfast sausage was a revelation, intensely porky; fresh sausage can do that, and its not that skimpy, skinny variety either.  The visually stunning roasted beets were equally delicious and refreshing.  Enjoyed with very good coffees, brunch here is more than worth the trip from outside LIC, and no surprise to see the crowds that flock here for it.Dinner doesn't get quite the same attention, but it is quite good and I'd have to say possibly better.  At my two dinners, I dined with a vegetarian and a person who prefers vegetarian, respectively.  Unsurprising at a restaurant that has a local green market ethos, there are more than enough dishes to build a vegetable-centric meal out of, especially from their appetizers and sides.The food is consistently excellent, shining with very fresh ingredients that require minimal fussing.  The kitchen is quite skillful in pairing ingredients to bring out innate flavors and textures, with a sure hand at preparation.  Their rotating menu makes specific comments quickly obsolete, but there should not be many disappointments, if any.  Not that I don't have some very visceral memories.  Frisee salad combining flavors of dried cherries, pecans, blue cheese, and mustard vinaigrette.  A texturally lovely barley with butternut squash and mushrooms, notes of sweet and earthiness co-mingling.  Creamy, perfect risotto balanced with bitter greens and fresh ricotta.  Refreshing crisp-tender bites of petite Japanese turnips.  If there were a less memorable dish, only the truffle fried potatoes come to mind; no knock to it as it was made just fine, but one can get good quality fries with truffle oil in any number of places.  But far and away, there is little LIC Market doesn't do well.That includes the proper sweet ending.  A few desserts are offered daily; the staff will let you know as it doesn't turn up on the menu.  Their fruit crumbles are wonderful; never too sweet, just redolent of fresh fruit and crisp oats.  Just as good are rings of fried apple served with freshly whipped cream.  Simple, but perfect that way.Without any sort of gimmick or hype, LIC Market impressed me enough to trek back to LIC three times in a month, quite a trip considering I live in south Brooklyn.  It makes the perfect neighborhood institution, low-key and friendly, and at once an eatery, bar, and coffee shop.  But at this quality, it is worth a trip from elsewhere.",5.0 star rating,"Forest Hills, NY",5,0,0.600000023842,25.5,"space,LIC

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,136686,"3.5 stars - I recently came here with some friends for brunch, after seeing all the great reviews. This is a cozy little place that one might pass by without even noticing. For me though, I would not consider this a 'hidden gem' (at least in the spectrum of NYC-brunch):The bread plate was good, but nothing to write home about (the only standout was the carrot cake); the duck hash was somewhat pedestrian IMO - a little dry, with a slightly-small portion of meat (like most other duck hashes you might've tried); the pulled pork, while tasty, brought to mind the typical Latin-style pernil+rice/beans (which, unfortunately in this case, also made me think of how much bigger the portions are if you were to go elsewhere in Queens..).The real winner on the table though, much to LIC Market's credit, was the pancakes (and I hate 99% of pancakes) - supplemented by our additional sides orders of bacon (nice and thick), sausage (cooked brilliantly, presumably under a broiler), and kale (good but not great; we needed something green).Lastly, for risk of coming across as an alcoholic - this is not a brunch place you go to if you're looking for a bloody mary, or otherwise free-refill boozefest. We had grapefruit mimosas (the other option being the standard orange), which were served in regular water glasses - not a big deal for me, but certainly something that most people would notice. Bottom line: For $20+ a person, I'd have been happier if the portions were at least a little bigger (on either the food or drink front).",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.300000011921,2.59999990463,"place,gem,brunch,friends,reviews,stars,something,pernil,NYC-brunch,bread plate,standout,grapefruit mimosas,carrot cake,home,nothing,spectrum,duck hash,portion,pork,portions,duck hashes,pancakes,IMO,pancakes,winner,elsewhere,rice,meat,beans,case,sausage,credit,bacon,orders,sides,table,bloody mary,boozefest,deal,water glasses,orange,option,Latin,Queens,LIC Market,people,line,person,front,food,brunch place,risk,kale,broiler,portions","7,7,4,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,3,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,7,7,7,7,7,2,3,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.1662876755,0.0905264392495,0.0860351249576,0.0688129886985,0.0688129886985,0.0688129886985,0.0552801303566,0.0227625463158,0.0158312320709,0.0150471599773,0.0150471599773,0.0147680230439,0.0134298261255,0.0126073760912,0.0126073760912,0.0126073760912,0.0116189429536,0.0106993112713,0.0101686250418,0.0100435707718,0.0097333798185,0.00949017237872,0.00907421577722,0.00890833884478,0.00851781852543,0.00851781852543,0.00851781852543,0.00851781852543,0.00851781852543,0.00851781852543,0.00779556948692,0.00779556948692,0.00779556948692,0.00779556948692,0.00779556948692,0.00779556948692,0.00582584412768,0.00582584412768,0.00580465374514,0.00580465374514,0.00580465374514,0.00580465374514,0.00504558254033,0.00504558254033,0.00461734319106,0.00401974422857,0.00400839233771,0.00400839233771,0.00400839233771,0.00400839233771,0.00362431653775,0.00255616172217,0.00255616172217,0.00255616172217,0.00218179309741"

I ended up just leaving it alone.  On to the s/s crab - it was well cooked but again WAY WAY WAY TOO SALTY (along w/ its veggie side).  Whoever cooked that night was just too heavy handed w/ the salt.  Now to the dessert - they didn't even have a dessert menu but often 3 options that night. I forgot what the other 2 were as they didnt sound appealing but we went w/ the blueberry crumble.  it was pretty good but again TOO SWEET.  We ordered one to share and couldn't finish it either - it was like eating a spoonful of sugar at each bite.  In the overall menu, the best thing was actually the handmade japlapeno sauce that they offered us (we asked for some hot sauce).    Now, on to the service, we were very well attended, water glass was never empty and they came to check in on us frequently but not obnoxiously.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,49124,"Quite possibly the best restaurant in Long Island City!  My coworkers and I have ordered from many places in the area, and LIC Market is the best for any meal of the day...including ""coffee breaks""!The atmosphere is very cozy - there's a small outdoor seating area in the front, more in the back.  Immediately upon entering, a shelf to your left houses several locally made jarred goods, foods, coffee, etc, with cute packaging.Staff is extremely kind and friendly; we come here often and they always have a smile on their face.Their specials and sides change often, which is nice and I assume it's because of whatever fresh ingredients are available.  The attention to freshness really, really shows in the flavor here.For breakfast, their yogurt is very filling and comes with a lot of stuff - recommended.For lunch, order ANYTHING and you'll be happy!!  There are different specials every day with different ingredients - everything tastes fresh and top quality.  I also really appreciate that they keep their website up to date, every morning, with the latest specials.  Sometimes they have fun, rare stuff like lobster sandwiches or foie gras burgers!Salads (Market Cobb or Chicken) - I'm a meat lover yet their salads are amazing!  They use great quality leafy vegetables, with crisp and juicy tomatoes that just pop with flavor in your mouth - these are really the best salads I've ever had.  It's a generous size too.Market Burger - My FAVORITE thing on the menu!!! One of my most favorite burgers in New York, including all the boroughs.  The meat is thick, tastes high quality, is perfectly charred while remaining juicy on the inside (I get medium rare)....the chef knows what he's doing!  The vegetables in it are fresh tasting, just like in the salad meals, the cheese melted over the meat is heaven in every bite, and thinking about the sauce they use in it is making me salivate right now.  The bread holds together very well and does not get soggy, even during delivery.  It's rare to find a burger that travels well!  The potato salad it comes with is also the best potato salad I've ever ordered from anywhere; extremely tasty.  If you order delivery for this burger, just make sure you ask them to put the potato salad in a separate box!  You won't want that stuff getting on to your burger.  I think this is also one of the best ""bang for your buck"" items on their menu.Vegetable sides - these change often and can be things like broccolini or brussel sprouts stir fried with bacon.  Whatever vegetable sides they have, I can confidently say they will be amazing!  It tastes great, is cooked perfectly, and the veggies retain the bright, saturated green they should have when cooked for the optimal amount of time (which is very short).  If you're a meat lover, definitely get the ones cooked with bacon!Soup sides - these change often too but are also of top quality.  When I get the tomato basil soup with cheese blended in to it, I'm such a happy person.  Perfect blend of creaminess to it.  Pea soup is delicious too, and every soup comes with bread.Pasta - These are very yummy but tend to be pretty small....somewhere between being a ""side"" and an actual meal, so you'll wanna order something else to go with it too.Coffee - probably the best you'll get in this neighborhood.  They know how to do a latte pretty well, and their coffee tastes much better than the only other place that's open for coffee in the area.  Their table for mixing milk and sugars with your regular coffee/ice coffee is well stocked too, and includes sugar syrup!  This is much appreciated since you can't mix sugar granules with ice coffee.  It's just not scientifically possible.Lemonade/Grapefruit juice: fresh tasting and really good!  Sweet, but that's how citrus fruits are.Desserts - Scones, danishes, cookies...I haven't had a bad one so far.  Great stuff.Basically anything you order will be great, haha!  The hours are different on certain days of the week, so check their website to see if they're open before you head out.",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",5,0,0.699999988079,26.0,"meat lover,meat lover,LIC Market,burger,vegetables,potato salad,smile,website,restaurant,filling,coffee,seating area,thing,area,meal,Long Island City,atmosphere,one,places,back,more,front,coworkers,goods,foods,left,Staff,shelf,stuff,coffee breaks,tomatoes,sauce,Grapefruit juice,items,place,chef,sides,breakfast,quality,specials,specials,tasting,ANYTHING,flavor,ingredients,meat,ingredients,Salads,foie gras burgers,burgers,lot,stuff - recommended.,freshness,lunch,everything,salads,cheese,burger,best,stuff,quality,meat,Vegetable sides,vegetable sides,vegetables,specials,Market,salad meals,heaven,soup,attention,flavor,menu,One,delivery,Coffee,coffee,coffee,coffee,ice coffee,bread,delivery,change,things,bacon,best,lobster sandwiches,Chicken,mouth,inside,bite,side,anywhere,box,buck,brussel sprouts,broccolini,cheese,meal,area,sugars,latte,table,stuff.,somewhere,ice coffee,veggies,creaminess,Market Burger - My FAVORITE,something,Pasta,neighborhood,milk,anything,New York,boroughs,Soup sides,tasting,tomato basil soup,citrus fruits,Pea soup,sugar syrup,sugar granules,danishes,cookies,one,change,quality,green,bacon,amount,blend,Lemonade,Sweet,Desserts - Scones,ones","1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,2,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,5,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,6,7","0.273100495338,0.0488578639925,0.0390285402536,0.0325396619737,0.0286337025464,0.0220050867647,0.0218299366534,0.0212267730385,0.0192119944841,0.0177631806582,0.0149301923811,0.0133807454258,0.0123830605298,0.0114985760301,0.0114985760301,0.0114003065974,0.0112084969878,0.0109885120764,0.0104613173753,0.00915576051921,0.00915576051921,0.00915576051921,0.00915576051921,0.00910892803222,0.00910892803222,0.00910892803222,0.00910892803222,0.00910892803222,0.00783477257937,0.00727479392663,0.00675452873111,0.0058803264983,0.00578713743016,0.00535393925384,0.00530087947845,0.00512130232528,0.00499685946852,0.00468852976337,0.00467529520392,0.00448438897729,0.00407733209431,0.00400791643187,0.00396240083501,0.00396240083501,0.00395121285692,0.00382766732946,0.00373272155412,0.00366960535757,0.00351165235043,0.00349581474438,0.003466892289,0.003466892289,0.003466892289,0.003466892289,0.00345710199326,0.00344429630786,0.00323114381172,0.00317759322934,0.00317529216409,0.00314310612157,0.00312515138648,0.00312170665711,0.00301801529713,0.00301594752818,0.00293000275269,0.00292597268708,0.00292026111856,0.00290037714876,0.00286305183545,0.00283166579902,0.00279487064108,0.00265160296112,0.00264764670283,0.00264411256649,0.00263533298858,0.00256775389425,0.0025664253626,0.0025664253626,0.00256514968351,0.00256514968351,0.00248231296428,0.0024052024819,0.00240161339752,0.00240161339752,0.00240161339752,0.00236361543648,0.0023238081485,0.0023238081485,0.00231987726875,0.00231052958407,0.00230798218399,0.00224650977179,0.00210600183345,0.00210427935235,0.00210113893263,0.00210113893263,0.00210113893263,0.00200094887987,0.00196542730555,0.00196441006847,0.00196343357675,0.00193912163377,0.00191373634152,0.00178890291136,0.00178758031689,0.00177506927866,0.00175268878229,0.00174958526623,0.00156731018797,0.00156388687901,0.00156388687901,0.00156388687901,0.00156230013818,0.00151160673704,0.00136933627073,0.00135810277425,0.00127177778631,0.00123506493401,0.00119686045218,0.00115071656182,0.00113639771007,0.00108150136657,0.00108098378405,0.00108000438195,0.00108000438195,0.00108000438195,0.00101190002169,0.000929236412048,0.000800310168415,0.000785159063525,0.000687300693244,0.0006860831636,0.000639461854007,0.000639177218545,0.000639177218545,0.000506579643115"

A run-down of the current vegetarian-friendly dishes that I tried (their menu does change):- BEETS. This was the best dish of the night. My girlfriend and I were split between whether this should be considered a starter or a dessert (we even pondered over ordering it again for dessert). The ricotta was light and creamy, with an added sweetness from the drizzled apple cider vinegar. I would return for this dish alone.- RISOTTO. The texture of the risotto contrasted nicely with the texture of the snap peas. The manner in which the sharfe maxx is utilized definitely adds a cheesy flavor. A strong dish, though I would've liked a more diverse flavor palette.- RADIATORS. A pasta dish with a wide variety of flavors and textures. I would rank this plate above the risotto.- BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Roasted brussels sprouts in a soy-based chili sauce. An average dish.

""Liver & Eggs"" ($15) - I'm not sure you can get much more decadent than a plate of creamy scrambled eggs in extra virgin olive oil with cubes of foie gras generously sprinkled all over it.  It takes full and absolute focus to make eggs this way, stirring constantly, ensuring a smooth creaminess and textural consistency.  It's not the largest plate ever, but then I'm not sure I could have survived a larger portion.  This was just right for pure indulgence2. Braised Slab Bacon ($10) - To complete my breakfast, I ordered the slab bacon.  I was also swayed when our waitress mentioned that the chef LOVES this dish.  It was delicious.  Not the standard type of bacon, this is slow cooked and incredibly juicy.  A lot of the fat melts away to become a decadent sauce/gravy/juice that you can dip your bread in.  It's a HUGE piece of bacon, so I'd suggest sharing this with others if you find it on the menu.  I could be happy just eating this and a baguette3. Market Burger ($12) - I had a few bites of my friend's perfectly cooked (medium rare), juicy, high quality meat with melted cheddar and a dollop of aioli on a carmelized onion bun.  My conclusion: this was one helluva tasty burger and the truffled oyster mushroom hash was in constant danger of being mooched (by ME!!!)4. Risotto ($13) - I understand that the ingredients change depending on the availability of seasonal ingredients, but I enjoyed the version with apples, onions and blue cheese and found it innovative and unexpectedly delicious!5. Seared Mushrooms ($5) - a solid size portion with ample garlic and a sprinkle of fresh thyme and toasted almonds6. Oyster Mushroom Hash ($7) - if you aren't already getting this with a burger, you'll absolutely want to order a side of this delicious truffle-y treat!7. Brussels Sprouts ($5) - expertly carmelized and tossed with bacon and figs!  Sweet and salty and smoky and slightly bitter all at once!8. & 9. Upon recommendation from our waitresses, we got a sweet finish in the form of the Crème Caramel and Apple Crisp.  Both were comforting and rich and I was really tempted to commandeer both for my personal consumption!  As you can imagine, there was nothing left to take home!Parting Thought: I desperately wish I could go to LIC Market for lunch!  LIC office workers - I hope you realize how lucky you are to have LIC Market in the hood!!!  No matter what, I'm definitely hitting LIC Market up for brunch!",5.0 star rating,"Singapore, Singapore",3,1,0.5,16.5,"LIC Market,hope,restaurant,success,piece,Everything,plate,everyone,service,food,caliber,juice,ingredients change,Liver & Eggs,eggs,eggs,focus,consistency,plate,chef,foie gras,cubes,extra virgin olive oil,creaminess,slab bacon,bacon,bacon,oyster mushroom hash,breakfast,type,burger,way,portion,waitress,bread,dish,lot,indulgence2,fat,gravy,sauce,others,menu,baguette3,bites,friend,bacon,meat,onion bun,dollop,cheddar,aioli,conclusion,danger,availability,Braised Slab Bacon,waitresses,Market Burger,treat,figs,Crème Caramel,form,recommendation,Risotto,consumption,finish,lunch,home,hood,office workers,matter,brunch,Brussels Sprouts,Apple Crisp,LIC,Mushrooms,burger,ingredients,apples,onions,size portion,Oyster Mushroom Hash,Both,blue cheese,garlic,sprinkle,thyme,almonds6,side,version","7,7,2,7,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,4,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,6","0.328127831221,0.0977247878909,0.0481849387288,0.0389340855181,0.0243088379502,0.0211280416697,0.0204765461385,0.0190991144627,0.0185908358544,0.0185908358544,0.0185908358544,0.0135581232607,0.0123551189899,0.0109272776172,0.00885371677577,0.00882874336094,0.00818070024252,0.00803108047694,0.00801256205887,0.00706422748044,0.00704733235762,0.00704733235762,0.00704733235762,0.0070274444297,0.00677349232137,0.00674622645602,0.00673196744174,0.00583934830502,0.00581669202074,0.00575362052768,0.0057279560715,0.00545465992764,0.00541059114039,0.005382866133,0.00536328088492,0.00489225098863,0.00481306761503,0.00472477497533,0.00469261221588,0.00469261221588,0.00469261221588,0.0046878545545,0.0046878545545,0.00468345405534,0.00467936089262,0.00467936089262,0.00457824673504,0.00428211223334,0.00428211223334,0.00428211223334,0.00428211223334,0.00428211223334,0.00427861092612,0.00427861092612,0.00427532475442,0.00401111971587,0.00363685539924,0.00348152057268,0.0031896030996,0.00318752974272,0.00318188662641,0.00318188662641,0.00318188662641,0.00288601964712,0.00251658447087,0.00234706373885,0.00220053782687,0.00220053782687,0.00219944375567,0.00219944375567,0.00219839136116,0.00219839136116,0.00188683904707,0.00188349746168,0.00187019910663,0.00175921048503,0.00175800453871,0.00160115142353,0.00160115142353,0.00160115142353,0.0015999909956,0.00159889424685,0.00157407170627,0.0014007515274,0.00139973626938,0.00139973626938,0.00139973626938,0.00139973626938,0.00139877665788,0.00138309632894"

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,2688,"I'm always in search to find good food in LIC and LIC Market was the place I decided to hit Sunday for brunch.  I really wanting to love this place after seeing the great reviews on Yelp, so I crossed my fingers and walked my way over. As I walked in I was excited to see that was cute ,cozy and clean, I thought I was in for a real treat. We ordered the Market burger and the roasted chicken sandwich and both were disappointing. Both dishes looked great when it reached our table but taste was not there. First the Roasted chicken sandwich was made with dark meat, for me that is a plus plus, I love dark meat, however the chicken itself lacked any flavor it needed seasoning and salt. I would have also enjoyed the sandwich more if the bread was toasted or pressed for some crunch. Next, the market burger looked AMAZING when we got it but when you bite into it you realize it's super greasy so the bun got soggy quickly and broke apart. The patty was very round shaped so it was impossible to eat it with the bun so I had to break out the fork and knife which I do not enjoy when eating a burger. The cheddar cheese I felt was too pungent with the burger but that's personal preference. Due to the lack of decent food in LIC I would probably give this place another shot, (if this place were in the city I would never return), for their breakfast or dinner menu. I hope I do find something great about this place.I really enjoyed  the complimentary plate of mini chocolate croissants, carrot cake and bread but the home made jam for me needed to be a little sweeter.

When I went to this place when I thought they would be serving brunch, they just had their lunch menu available. I guess they change their menu frequently because none of the dishes I saw on Yelp were listed. My boyfriend ordered the pull-pork with rice and beans since he's a big eater and that seemed to be the only ""big"" plate they had on the menu that day. I ordered the chicken with broccolini. My chicken was AMAZING and well-seasoned, while my boyfriend's dish was well ... bland. It looked bland and unappetizing to begin with. He's a big critic on food (and a great cook) so I decided to try it out myself and I couldn't agree with him more. Needless to say, he was very disappointed. He eventually took some of the spices on my chicken and added it to his pulled pork dish to add some flavor. All the while, I think this place has great potential. I would come again if I knew what was on the menu that day. The place is small but cozy. It wasn't that busy when we arrived but we did have to share the table with another couple, which was awkward since we could clearly hear their convo and vice versa. Price point, I think it was fair.

If it's a nice day, I recommend walking over to Gantry State Park after lunch and then grabbing a scoop of homemade ice cream from Malu. you'll win over an LIC newbie (my dining companion included) in no time! :)",5.0 star rating,"Somerville, MA",2,1,0.40000000596,8.69999980927,"lunch,sandwich,BLT sandwich,friend,neighborhood,buzz,mix,employees,folks,LIC Market,Citi,gazpacho special,sandwiches,one,applewood bacon,avocado,strips,coffee,people,arugula,aioli,pieces,bread,tomato,rice,beans,pork,dish,bowl,soup,croutons,staff,staff,neighborhood feel,place,lunch,dining companion,scoop,ice cream,newbie,Gantry State Park,regulars,people,one,LIC,top,Malu","4,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,1,7,3,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,1,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,3,7,2","0.11151945591,0.0769224613905,0.068037584424,0.0554075650871,0.0537372492254,0.0470876991749,0.0470876991749,0.0470876991749,0.0470876991749,0.0298174824566,0.0279972329736,0.0265436153859,0.0225859060884,0.0218901056796,0.0179243758321,0.0179243758321,0.0179243758321,0.0147533956915,0.0133769484237,0.0121126826853,0.0121126826853,0.0121126826853,0.0121126826853,0.0121126826853,0.0120272319764,0.0120272319764,0.0120272319764,0.0118760298938,0.01097285375,0.01097285375,0.01097285375,0.0104506146163,0.00933810323477,0.00817127898335,0.00817127898335,0.00646125432104,0.00609421497211,0.00565339438617,0.00565339438617,0.0056480881758,0.00483433995396,0.00439694011584,0.00410303426906,0.00410303426906,0.00382226798683,0.00359890633263,0.00334723317064"

Again, I checked yelp to confirm they were open on a weekday for breakfast and indeed they are.  But when I got there with my kids who were looking forward to the pancakes I raved about - I was given a very limited breakfast menu with NO pancakes on it.  I asked what's up and got excuses about a small kitchen and there being some ""fine print"" on the website that pancakes are a ""brunch"" only item.  But excuse me, I think pancakes are a breakfast staple and I make them on a 8"" griddle at home so I can't see how space is an issue.  And why is it my job to comb through the fine print on their website to make sure they are serving a basic item before I bring my kids there.The fact is that the food was good at this place, when they would serve it.  But the staff and management is too precious.  Instead of trying to accommodate a couple of kids who would of loved some pancakes they blew us off.  I will never go back and I imagine that attitude will only lead to disappointment eventually for other patrons as well.  And another thing, ""No. I do not want to sit out in your shitty little deck under microwave heat lamps.""

Perry and I took a little time to meander around five points and the amazing graffiti before stopping in for dinner. LIC Market is quite cozy and inconspicuous. There were a lot of hipsters around (maybe coming from nearby PS 1/MoMA?) but the area directly around LIC Market is a bit quiet. We perused the menu, which appeared to have a lot of market fresh, seasonal items. We decided to order: - Wild salmon - Burger - Truffle fried potatoes - Snap peas - Plum crostadaThe salmon was perfectly done - not overcooked, with a bright orange center. The burger looked fab, but the fiance didn't want to share. The fries were delicious - thickly cut, well seasoned, and crisp. The snap peas were exactly as I wanted. And the plum crostada was a refreshing and tart finish. I would love to try other things on the menu (hanger steak anyone?) and perhaps be back for brunch. Service was good - glasses always filled, timely questions, and friendly. The price point is also reasonable. The space is probably the only constraining factor - it can feel crowded here and they can max out seating quickly.

No experience with breakfast or dinner, sorry.For lunch, I tend to vote we go here. Why? Service is fantastic, food is great, simple, feels healthy - i.e. clean flavors, seemingly fresh ingredients (FWIW), and consistent.It's pretty small, while that's nice and ""cozy"" when it's quiet, on a busy day it's often a fairly long wait to be seated. Recently they changed the seating in the dining room which helped keep you from bumping into your neighbor, but probably cut down on the overall number of seats. Still, if you do get seated, you'll have as much water as you want replenished very often from re-purposed wine bottles. Sounds trite, but when you're thirsty and don't have to think about it, it's nice.My go-to meal here is the roast chicken platter. For $11 you get what looks to be a 1/4 chicken, roasted, with broccolini (rabe?) that's got figs and bacon (!) and a little slice of bread/toast. Probably the most well-rounded meal I eat in a given day. Sandwiches are also very good. Definitely recommended if you're in the area.

Dinner menu is simple and seasonal with no more than a dozen items available. Burger was one of the best I have ever had, with a juicy beef patty, topped with cheddar and aioli and served on a grilled caramelized onion bun. I would return time and time again for the burger alone. Sea scallops were served in a savory broth of lemon zest and olive oil, perfect medium to be mopped up by some grilled bread on the side. White asparagus with olive tapenade, boiled eggs and white anchovies was served room temperature and lacked a bit on the flavor spectrum. Sides menu was probably the most interesting part of the menu - I was tempted to make a full meal out of items sounding like radish greens with pumpkin seeds and currants and bok choy with toasted garlic and stewed grape tomatoes.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,198544,"I got dragged here for a late lunch while trying to hunt down grub before hitting up the MoMA @ PS1. I really just wanted a hefty burger, and we passed by several joints that could've fulfilled that-- a diner (yes please?), a burger shop that screams 'Murica (YES YES YES, can we?), before finally finding LIC Market. She name dropped it, so I thought it might've been fancy or actually just a market.Some would call it a hidden gem-- it was tucked away underneath a dentist's shop (Were you trying to tell me something?). I ordered The Burger, which I assumed is so-named because it totally is the only burger on the menu. It came with a caramelized onion bun, cheddar, sliced tomato, greens, aioli, and came with a hefty portion of potato salad (NO FRIES ON THE MENU, WHAT). The burger wasn't totally stacked like I had hoped, but the bun had a nice hard texture to it. Not bad, can't really complain.My date ordered the tomato soup with ricotta and basil oil, and the slow cooked pork sandwich (with soman bread, gruyere, house-made pickles, and pommery mustard dressing). I didn't try the soup, and I assumed the sandwich wasn't that great because she slathered on some ketchup.

Now that its warmer I usually go for a salad or my fav. which is the veggie plate. The only issue I have is that the menu list the veggie plate as coming with long grain rice and I have never once ordered it when it didn't come with jasmine rice. Its still delicious but I think they need to fix that on the menu. The brisket sandwich is also amazing. Whenever a friend comes to meet me for lunch, this is the spot I take them to.

I got 2 carrot bread cake and 1 croissant and no side butter or jam to go with it. Sadly disappointed.Duck hash came with duck, nut, cranberry or raisin, shredded duck and 2 sunnyside egg and side potatoes. The flavor tasted like Moroccan--raisin and nut together with a protein. The duck itself was very dry but I see why people like this. It's the combination of salty, sweet, crunchy all together in a bite. $12 --- it's filling but kind of pricey.The frittata today was brussel spouts. Nothing special. Just a regular thick omelet filled with chucks of brussel spouts and cheese. After a few bites in, it gets really monotone. It also came with toast with butter and side potatoes. Side potatoes is better than the diners---baked, crunchy, and flavor okay. $9The staff are all polite and attentive--especially if you order coffee, they come around often to refill your cup.For breakfast, this isn't worth the price.

It caters to tourists and those who can linger for lunch. (Note: Not recommended for nearby office workers looking for a quick lunch). It's a narrow restaurant, and the noise travels, so it can get loud when it's busy.I ordered the soup of the day - tomato soup and a side of broccolini (with bacon, onions and figs). I asked for the broccolini without the bacon and they easily accommodated. The tomato soup is tangy and creamy from the dollop of ricotta. It was much bigger than expected and came in a big and slightly shallow bowl with a piece of bread. The broccolini is sauteed so pretty heavily dosed in oil. The figs were a sweet touch.

For my Sunday brunch, I settled on the buttermilk pancakes with house-made berry jam and pumpkin seed butter. These pancakes were out of sight: fluffy, warm, powdered sugar on top, rich...everything you could ask for. The sourness of the jam, the savory of the butter and the sweetness of the syrup truly came together amazingly. I also ordered sausages on the side and what a bargain they were.  You are given three moderately sized sausages and they were really tasty with a good bite.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,5849,"Looking for a new brunch spot? Then LIC Market's a perfect choice. Although it's located in an area without a lot of commercial, nestled away is a black awning leading down to a narrow restaurant. It would go unnoticed to many, except for the crowds that come as soon as it opens. We got here at 10:30 AM on a Sunday, 30 minutes after opening, and there were already people waiting for a table. Luckily, there was a high-chair table available near the front.As soon as we were seated, our waiter had come over with menus and asked what we'd like to drink. We both said coffee, and the waiter proceeded to walk away. Almost immediately, another staff member had dropped off the mugs and sugar over, and then then our original waiter had come with the carafe to pour the coffee. Wow, was I amazed at the prompt and attentive service. It sort of felt like my own personal waitstaff. He then took our orders, which I chose the Slow Roasted Duck Hash ($12.00) from the waiter's recommendation after much deliberation between that and the ""Dirty Rice"" Frittata ($11.00).We were then provided with a small plate of complimentary bread: 2 pieces of a carrot bread, a chocolate croissant, and 2 very thin slices of 7 grain bread. I was surprised at how good the bread was, a definite step up from your generic Italian-like restaurant bread.What was no more than 10 minutes later, my dish of Slow Roasted Duck Hash was served. Portions looked scant at first, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very filling dish. It's not hungry man proportions, but you'll leave mostly satisfied. Mixed along with the shredded-like roasted duck were crisp potato squares, red onions, peppers, dried cherries, pine nuts, all topped with two fried eggs. I immediately cracked the egg yolk in the middle to let all that yellow goodness coat the food. Texturally, it was outstanding, from tender and moist duck (with a few semi-crunchy pieces), to crispy yet soft potatoes, to the pine nuts. Flavors were on point, from the red onions giving it some bite, to the dried cherries that gave it a very subtle sweetness. There was nothing to dislike about this dish, but everything to like.I also had the chance to try the Sausage & Onions Sandwich ($9.00) which included two fried eggs, breakfast sausage, caramelized onions, cheddar on a brioche bun, and served with home fries on the side. It was a fairly average sandwich, but still very enjoyable. I'd definitely spend the few extra bucks to get the Slow Roasted Duck Hash.Overall, LIC Market was a winner in my book.

I thought I was walking into someones basement or something like that but was easily relaxed when I saw all the patrons laughing and enjoying this place. Ordered the meat platter to start off and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of meats that were served for this dish. I couldn't wait to get my entree now. The liver and eggs. Creamy scrambled eggs with big chunks of Foie Gras on delicious bread. Although I could have eaten 5 orders of this, it was awesome.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,29165,"heard about this place for awhile, decided to go for a first date with this guy. It was very uncomfortable and just depressing all around. We decided to have a brunch date on the earlier side. They dont take reservations, and once I got there I understood why, its a bottom floor apartment they made into a restaurant, Its not cute, its not spacious, its small and tight and busy because its LIC, so there isn't much around in the his area.We decided to meet at 11am on Sunday, he got there before me. The whole vibe of the place is stresses and tired, even at 11am. The host was not happy at all, we were sat pretty quickly thankfully at close to the bar, near the entrance of the restaurant. because of the space its where everyone must pass you, everyone in the restaurant passes you, we were by the service bar. My date and I didnt even get to sit down for more than 10 seconds before this blonde russian waitress came over and asked us in a rush if we needed anything. no joke, Didnt even get to take a breathe. its 11am, whats the drama about?The only reason I will give this place any credit is the food is cheap and great for the price. That is it. We ordered coffee and drinks, she returned with them but without my wine, she ran off so I had to yell at her to ask her if the wine was coming, she cocked a attitude with me about asking, saying ""Its coming"" I yelled back to her across tables in a very angry voice ""Thank you"" because she was a pill. Our presence aggravated her. I wanted to leave as soon as possible, its was just horrible. Not fun, not hospitable, you rushed and taking anytime to enjoy yourself isn't welcome. Its a joke. I tipped 18% because I felt bad for the place, but honestly I would have left 2 dollars because of the experience. I couldn't enjoy my date which I think set us not to see each other again because it just wasn't fun.

And, NO to the groups of loud socialites that talk about last night's shenanigans in the Meatpacking District. Just no.A quick trip on the 4 and 7 brought me to a Long Island City brunch oasis, LIC Market. Here you can trade in Manhattan's overplayed benedicts for phenomenal farm-to-table indulgences. On the savory side, the duck hash won out in my book. But the dirty rice frittata and the pork dish (which is huge, by the way) did not follow too far behind. Surprisingly, the pancakes were the star of the meal. Substantial, flavorful pancakes topped with rich pumpkin seed butter, berry jam, and syrup. I don't take this lightly, but it was possibly the best pancake I've had in NYC (definitely on par with Clinton St).Substitute the hour and a half wait for 25 mins and the irksome crowds for normal, unpretentious people.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,18042,"The bottom line with this place: a nice little brunch place in LIC with delicious food at reasonable prices that you should definitely go to.  This has been my weekend brunch spot for the past couple of weekends in a row and I don't see that ending anytime soon.LIC Market is on 44th drive right by an EGM stop and a Q69 bus stop so getting there from my place is a snap.  You walk down a little series of steps into a bar area and mini-shop (where they sell their amazing blueberry jam).  If you come early enough (like 1030 or 11am) on a weekend, you can typically be seated right away, but around noon or so the place starts getting a bit crowded.  But don't worry, you'll only have to wait 15 min or so for a table at that point so it's not too bad.  The place itself is basically just one room with a few tables and can maybe seat like 20 or so people max.  You almost feel like you're inside of a slightly upscale inn: there are wood tables and benches, but also paintings and a good deal of metal.  It's pretty cool.But, we all know what matters to me: portion, taste, and price.  The portions are not huge, but they are reasonably sized for the price.  Disclaimer: the portions probably are quite big, but my stomach is way bigger than my eyes so I have a slightly warped sense of what a reasonable portion size is.  ;)  The food tastes amazing (more on that below): flavors and textures complement each other in almost every dish and I need to try to recreate some of this magic at home.  The price is pretty reasonable given the taste and the portion size.Here are the dishes I've tried and what I thought about them:1.  Slow Cooked Pork  - this is my favorite dish of theirs.  It consists of ample quantities of shredded pulled pork with slightly sunnyside up eggs over black beans and rice.  The rice basically absorbs all of the flavor of the pork and eggs plus the beans provide you with a little bit of fiber and make you feel like you're not eating something that's super unhealthy.  I think the dish can be perhaps improved for me by adding a little bit of hot sauce.  Further experimentation is needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.2.  Slow Roasted Duck Hash - It's arguably also really good, but not my favorite.  A combination of shreds of duck over potatoes with cherries with two fried eggs.  The cherries provide a sweet flavor contrast with the savory duck and they even add in a little pine nuts for texture.3.  ""Dirty rice"" frittata - Really awesome.  It's like an omelet kind of with rice, chorizo, and chicken livers in the center.  That all tasted really good, but what really did it for me was the greens that they topped the frittata with and the dressing that went on top of the greens.  It was just a light vinaigrette dressing, but I think it made all the difference in completing the dish.4.  Buttermilk Pancakes - Oh yes yes yes yes yes.  Fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth pancakes covered with pumpkin seed butter, jam, and maple syrup my goodness oh wow.  Put these in your face over and over and over again and don't regret one minute of it.  I lied about the slow cooked pork, this is probably the best dish I've eaten here.  These pancakes are incredible.  I don't even remember where I am right now.  Anyhow, we just order it as a dessert and split it amongst whoever's there.  It goes without saying that we're going to order it every time we go.  Just to really drive home how good these are: I'm somehow who typically inhales his food.  You blink and my food is gone.  Not with these.  These I cut into eighths and then cover each slice with one of the three toppings (or a combination) and savor every last bite.  That's how good they are.Here are the side dishes and daily specials that I've tried:1.  The Dandelion Greens - Delicious.  Absolutely delicious.  Tastes just like Chinese Choy Sum (a green veggie with flowers).  They prepare it in a similar way by stir frying it with oil and a little bit of salt and perhaps some garlic.2.  Bok Choy with Tomatoes - Pretty good and prepared in the same fashion as the Dandelion Greens.  I wasn't as big a fan of this one, but it was still good.3.  The Roasted Beets - Amazing flavor and covered with pecans and balsamic vinegar.  This is something I think of as more of something you taste rather than something that will fill you up.You know a place has really good food when you have a play argument with your friends about which of their awesome dishes is truly the best (Slow Cooked Pork = better than the Slow Roasted Duck Hash: you know who you are) and you end up ordering them all anyway ""just to make sure.""  Am I going back tomorrow for a weekend double-header?

I finally got around to it for dinner and I thought it was good but I wasn't blown away. My friend also agreed that it was fine but not spectacular. We ordered and split: the burger, the risotto and the beignets. The burger was very good. The meat was pretty tasty and the toppings were good but it didn't blow us away. I think the bread, which was like a ciabatta roll, threw us off. I generally like softer rolls that almost melt into the meat and complement the taste and texture of the burger. I thought the roll they used distracted from the meat and didn't hold together well. The risotto was delicious. I would definitely come back to LIC Market just to get it again. It had red onions, yellow and red cherry tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic, basil and ricotta cheese. It was so fresh and healthy tasting. I felt like they literally just picked all the ingredients from the garden after I ordered.  We ordered the beignets for dessert with a blueberry compote and they were just okay. The beignets themselves were kind of bland and the blueberry compote was tart which I guess was to balance out the sugar coating on the beignets but didn't work for me. Overall I would definitely say LIC Market is a fine, fairly priced and inviting restaurant. I would plan to come back to try some of their other dishes but am a little hesitant to recommend to others as I think there are restaurants in the area that are a few notches better.",3.0 star rating,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",2,0,0.20000000298,9.69999980927,"LIC Market,blueberry compote,meat,tasting,dinner,friend,beignets,rolls,bread,burger,beignets,burger,risotto,split,risotto,ciabatta roll,meat,burger,roll,meat,taste,restaurants,texture,onions,ricotta cheese,basil,balsamic,olive oil,cherry tomatoes,some,restaurant,sugar coating,toppings,dishes,others,area,blueberry compote,ingredients,garden,dessert,beignets","7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,6,7,1,2,7,7,2,7,7","0.157867506146,0.103691272438,0.094218172133,0.0552140809596,0.0469114407897,0.0466729924083,0.0423051081598,0.0400572195649,0.0362700670958,0.0266492031515,0.0240969713777,0.0223945323378,0.0203752350062,0.0178333818913,0.0162456613034,0.0150272520259,0.0150018902496,0.0150018902496,0.0149795543402,0.0149795543402,0.0147236753255,0.014354782179,0.0119427330792,0.0108739892021,0.0108739892021,0.0108739892021,0.0108739892021,0.0108739892021,0.0108739892021,0.00929320883006,0.00924616027623,0.00809659808874,0.0076946625486,0.00559839000925,0.00559839000925,0.00559839000925,0.00406360626221,0.00355829298496,0.00355829298496,0.00355518143624,0.00208071549423"
LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,35664,"What a cute place! Nested closely under the train tracks, this quaint little restaurant looked a little out of place while fitting in perfectly at the same time. Is that even possible?My friend and I made plans to meet at 11am for brunch and it was perfect timing. There were a couple of tables available so no wait. Definite score bc just a short 10 mins later, I can see the crowd increasing. If you do end up waiting, just order a coffee to quench the thirst and wake up. Our hostess walked us to the back of the restaurant and the first thing I noticed was the wall art. I didn't ask, but I'm assuming it's made by local artists. With a few tables, it's a perfect fit for maybe 30 people. The decor includes the mentioned wall art, dried flowers, and jarred terrariums. Definitely fits in with the hipster-populated hood.After we ordered, our waiter immediately brought us a plate of bread and pastries filled with carrot bread (moist and just sweet enough... tasty!), croissant, butter and blueberry jam. Nice little treat while waiting for the entrees to arrive. I had the frittata of the day - cauliflower, red onions, and gruyere - and my friend had the two eggs special. The frittata was perfect.

The lack of options made this place a welcome reprieve from the delis and fast food joints in the area. However, we've started to notice a slide in their dinner food over the past few visits. Last night I ordered the halibut while the gf ordered the burger. First off the burger, normally a solid option, was surprisingly underwhelming. The restaurant changed the bun (previously a brioche if I recall) and overcooked the burger when it was supposed to be medium. Second, the halibut was simply too dry. I understand cooking halibut can be a bit challenging, but if I'm spending nearly $30 for a maybe 4 oz. piece of filet I expect you to know what you're doing. Especially if you don't serve any accompaniments, e.g. salad, a potato, anything but seriously a 4 oz. piece of fish for $30?Angway, I digress, LIC Market will remain my option for brunch, but I can't come here anymore for dinner.

I inhaled the pancakes in about two seconds, and ignored the disappointment of how quickly it went by just focusing on the wonderful flavors on my tongue.

Well shoo, after walking in past a glorious oinker grilling on a spit, why not?We were seated promptly with a smile. Clean bathroom just past the bar, mildly cramped layout and somewhat hipster decor. After chatting with our server about the truncated offerings due to the occasion, we opted to family-style a helping of the clam bake, a helping of the pig roast, and one regular menu item. The most disappointing part of our meal were the grapefruit mimosas! Everything was fresh, fairly seasoned, and cooked well. Clam bake featured little neck clams, crawfish, PEI mussels, and prawns, plus potatoes, corn on the cob, and some alright chorizo. Condiment-wise, salsa verde impressed more than the pig's queso fresco or pico de gallo. Rice and black beans adequate without being totally plain, plus shredded romaine and barely griddled corn tortillas.

The radicchio salad was bland. A little salt and pepper helped, but I wouldn't recommend it. Radicchio is too strong for such a mild dressing. The spaghetti was just the right amount of chewy and full of flavor. I ordered my steak medium and it came out very well done. The server took it back without hesitation. The second time around was a charm - it was tender and juicy and the accompanying baby turnips were tasty as well. The French fries in truffle oil were delicious, as were the beignets with blueberry sauce.The food, except for the salad, was all quite good. The service was fine if a little rushed. She seemed a little too eager to take our various orders i.e. to get us out of there quicker even though there were plenty of open spots. When I say I need more time, that means more than a minute! My only gripe was the portions - they are skimpy (which my companion had also said after his first time there). I am not a huge eater by any means but after half a salad, half an order of French fries, a whole 6 oz. sirloin and a few beignets, I still felt like I could have eaten a little something else. My companion's spaghetti was downright kid-sized. There was a bunch of beefy guys at the table next to ours and they ordered two appetizers and two entrees each!Anyway, it was a fine experience.

We got the duck hash, pulled pork sandwich, pancakes, and the slow cooked pork w/rice and beans. You can also get a side of the spicy salsa which was great with the duck hash and slow cooked pork plates. Everything was fantastic, and you don't get overly stuffed from the meals unless you eat more than what you're served! I really liked the pancakes too. They were so fluffy and delicious. The pumpkin seed butter is pretty unique, and I liked the blackberry jam too. They also don't rush you to get out when you're finished with your meal.

(and yeah, my dad is notorious for telling me that the reason for this is because, ""Everyone picks on a booger,"") ... but LIC Market felt like another joke. One where the punchline fell short and everyone in my group was left sitting at the table saying, ""Wait - what?!""We waited forever for a table on a packed Sunday morning. No problems there. I poached my friend's smartphone and showed the Yelp reviews. ""This place will be awesome, see?"" 50 minutes later and a spacious table in the back, my group of four was happy as clams. Until we browsed the menu. Sure, it might've been the drinking the night before. Or heck, maybe it was the bitch Sandy that had destroyed our car and left us weary - but the menu was difficult to navigate. The descriptions felt off - askew? - and we struggled to interpret. Nothing piqued our interest, which is generally a bad sign for a restaurant and even worse for a menu. We settled on a few dishes: some lentil stew thing, a chicken sandwich with arugula, eggs over medium with sausage and the pancakes. Run-down: Coffee tasted burnt. Lentil stew was pretty gross (I'm really sorry but I love lentils and this thing was just bizarre. Cherry tomatoes? Lentils? Zucchini? If Skrillex was a chef he'd be the master of this mash-up weird-fest) ... My hubby's eggs over medium were entirely cooked through (no runny yolk) and the look of disappointment on his face was apparent.

I asked how it would be for a table for 2 and they said it'd be no problem. When we first walked in - I won't lie, I was a little intimidated and hungry. Very hungry. It was totally packed up front with hungry brunchers. The host was super friendly and quoted us 10 minutes. Stomach was happy about this quote. We stood with the masses and ordered mimosas, and ten minutes later we were seated! Amazing so far.  We started with the croissant, which were homemade. M and I both agreed this was one of the best croissants we'd ever had. We had an eye for the pan au chocolat for dessert but of course.. By the end of our meal it was gone. We'll be back for you my sweet. I had the risotto with scallops. AMAZING. I usually wouldn't order something like risotto for brunch but this dish was on the specials menu and I couldn't resist. They cooked the risotto perfectly and the scallops were an absolute treat. A very filling and rich brunch option. Highly recommended! M had the shirred eggs with manchego and chorizo. Tasty and hearty. I mean cheese, eggs, and chorizo.. How does that not sound like a great brunch meal? Our server was super sweet and attentive.

But if you come here on a normal weekday, you get seated pretty quickly. I like that they have a semi-outdoor area in the back where you can get some natural sunlight in on a nice day. As far as food goes, it's consistently delicious. For brunch, I'm a fan of their sausage and fried egg on a brioche bun. Its monstrosity may appear intimidating but don't fear, it can only do good for your stomach. I also really enjoy their chicken salad sandwich on their lunch menu. Sounds plain and simple but not many places cannot make a decent and mouth-watering chicken salad sandwich like they do. If you have room left in your stomach, grab one of their chocolate chip cookies to go and it will leave you with many sweet memories.  Price-wise, it's ridiculously reasonable given the portion sizes.

Their menu labels dishes very simply: ""Carrots."" ""Mushrooms."" ""Spring Salad.""But Oh. The actual dishes? They are So Much More than just Carrots. Mushrooms. and Spring Salad. LIC Market focuses on creating dishes using seasonal ingredients. The ambiance is cozy, the music eclectic yet pleasant (we heard blues, country, chacha, cumbia... you name it!), the staff friendly and helpful. I asked them to prepare all the dishes without dairy and my friend was in disbelief that there was no butter used, because the dishes were creamy and rich without being too overpowering. We ordered the carrots appetizer to start, which was kind of the star of the show. If you order the mushrooms appetizer as well, definitely eat those first, as the flavor is much lighter than the carrots dish. The carrots paired with smoked trout were HEAVENLY. I thought the sorrel brought just the lightest acidity and bite to it. I loved it. Bit of advice- use the bread they bring to the table to sop up all of the sauce and juices. Yep. The wild striped bass was also fantastic. Everything kind of just melts in your mouth. The best part of the beluga lentil dish was the occasional chantarelle mushroom- pleasant surprises.I am excited to come here to try brunch, and to just have a cocktail at the bar.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,9185,"LIC Market. Yes. Yes. Yes. The unassuming location of this gem is part of the pleasure: it's one gritty block from the CITI monstrosity, just west the elevated 7 train, and a wanderer would have no idea that this beloved, cozy, hipsterish oasis was hiding right next to the bigger awning for some Italian restaurant.Go for brunch, arrive early. Breathe in the aura of smiles, tattoos, and locally pickled jalapenos. Read the specials board, allow your eyes to widen. Bring a few friends so you can share the memory of this wonderful meal, and so it won't be tooooo embarrassing to order the entire menu. If the line is long, and bar stools are open, then lucky you! You get to dine with Laura the bartender, who has excellent taste and such a nice way about her you'll feel better about yourself for a day or two. A piece of bread is nice enough to start a meal, but why settle? At LIC Market, grainy bread arrives alongside carrot cake/bread. And little chocolate croissants. And apple marmalade. A note about butter: since the NYC DoH decided all butter has to be colder than 42 degrees, butter sucks in this town. But LIC doesn't take shit from the man, and they don't freeze their butter. The resulting condiment is a rare joy.An old Catherine J Best Practice: Order the pancakes to start. Share them with your friends. I'm not even going to tell you how good they are, because I want you to discover it on your own. The duck hash with pine nuts and cherries, the shirred eggs with lentils and chorizo, the bullseye eggs...every dish is as good as it sounds, except the soft-cooked egg salad, which is better than it sounds--especially if you ask them to poach the egg instead of soft-boiling it. Try as I might, it's what I order every time I've been there.Yes, it's a little cramped and you might have to wait a little while (especially if your group has more than 4 ppl), but the meal is so wonderful.

I've never been inclined to write a review, but after repeatedly great and consistent visits to this restaurant, I just had to write one. I consider it positive karma to write this review and give back to a business that is trying to do something simple but very well. The dishes are smart and wonderfully crafted. I've had the ""Liver and Eggs"", which consisted of foie gras and fluffy scrambled eggs on toast. Gourmet, unpretentious comfort food. Paradoxical? Yes. Delicious. Absolutely! Well priced? For being 5 minutes out of Manhattan and w. generous helpings of foie gras? I was pleasantly surprised.I took my sister here for her birthday. Another friend of mine who I dragged to LIC said that the Market burger was the most delicious burger he had ever had. Even the hash and the asparagus is well prepared.Today, I had the soft-boiled egg and frisee salad. Not my first time, and definitely not my last! I've never been here during a peak hour and it was so crowded that I had to sit at the bar (this is also one restaurant, where I feel completely comfortable eating with friends, and also dining alone, which is a rarity). The owner was gracious as always. I left thinking, this is what a restaurant is and should be.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,34612,"LIC Market comes very close, but there is just something missing. I really love exploring NYC restaurants, so most of the time, if I have the choice between visiting a place I've already tried and visiting someplace new, I opt for the unknown. But there are a few exceptions; for example, I have absolutely no desire to explore other yakitori joints in the city because Yakitori Totto is just that damn good.So that, I've realized, is basically my litmus test for deciding whether a place deserves five stars: if it's so freaking good that it convinces me to stop exploring, settle down, and commit.LIC Market has most of the ingredients for a five-star combination: a cute and comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, no wait for brunch (!), and thoughtful, tasty, well-prepared food. But I just don't want to commit to LIC Market. The thing is, the menu is just a tad too limited. I know that having a small menu helps keep prices down and quality up, but I wish there were just a few more options. For example, yesterday at brunch my fiancé wanted something sweet and bready, like pancakes or french toast. There weren't any pancakes on the menu, and the french toast of the day was a super-sweet combination of cranberry bread soaked in custard and banana caramel sauce. He loved it, but anyone who wanted a slightly less dessert-y (but still bready) brunch option would have been out of luck.After hemming and hawing for a few minutes, I finally decided to get the frittata of the day with broccoli rabe, mozzarella, and mushrooms instead of bacon. I really appreciated how willing they were to swap out the bacon, and everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. I usually don't like potatoes very much, so I was surprised to see myself scarf down every single yummy little potato on the plate.Overall, our brunch at LIC Market was great. If this place had even just three or four more options on the menu, it might become a five-star joint.But for now, I'll keep exploring.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.09999990463,"LIC Market,something,desire,menu,place,most,french toast,menu,restaurants,choice,unknown,NYC,exceptions,stars,place,litmus test,example,yakitori joints,city,brunch,brunch,thing,anyone,most,combination,prices,prices,scarf,good.So,Yakitori Totto,example,something,pancakes,french toast,food,wait,atmosphere,ingredients,cranberry bread,fiancé,potatoes,bacon,bacon,brunch,broccoli rabe,mozzarella,mushrooms,everything,menu,place,joint.,options,potato,options,plate.,pancakes,frittata,brunch option,banana caramel sauce,custard,dessert-y","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.23701018095,0.0788330286741,0.0737249925733,0.0477992668748,0.0443122051656,0.0309953633696,0.0309096910059,0.029234321788,0.0271454658359,0.0271454658359,0.0271454658359,0.0161154028028,0.015702534467,0.0129949804395,0.0129949804395,0.0128282066435,0.0118224313483,0.0118224313483,0.0103466752917,0.00944861490279,0.00855535175651,0.00850276928395,0.00820851419121,0.00798664242029,0.00798664242029,0.00798664242029,0.00771893188357,0.00770446006209,0.00760260084644,0.00750695262104,0.00723129883409,0.00723129883409,0.00723129883409,0.00723129883409,0.00698870886117,0.00698870886117,0.00698870886117,0.00698870886117,0.00631687743589,0.00624793302268,0.00551086245105,0.00538666266948,0.00537947751582,0.00525726750493,0.00471314694732,0.00471314694732,0.00471314694732,0.0047068586573,0.0043978439644,0.00435338774696,0.00421870686114,0.0040860879235,0.00372061645612,0.00345189752989,0.00325521314517,0.0031282028649,0.00266433390789,0.0025983392261,0.0020706106443,0.0020706106443,0.00206752005033"
LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,198584,"I'm not gonna lie - I was a little depressed after moving into LIC from Manhattan. While I moved to LIC fully knowing that it was not 100% yet a 24/7 work/live/play area and that there's not much retail in yet, it wasn't until I made the move that I discovered exactly how deep the lack of retail/restaurants was. However one day, with no expectations whatsoever of how it would be, I went to LIC Market for brunch, and I was very pleasantly surprised!We went at a popular brunch time (~1pm) and only had to wait around 10 minutes or so, although I do think that maybe their hostesses also do double duty with other things because she wasn't really paying a lot of attention to the people waiting to be seated for a while. Anyways, once we got seated, service was excellent.Food: My bloody mary wasn't that great (really just tasted like tomato juice and extremely little alcohol) but the food was so good. I got the pancakes which were some of the best I've ever had, and my boyfriend got the frittata which came with home fries, both of which were also excellent. We got the mozzarella sandwich to share which was fine - nothing really wrong with it, but nothing great either. It was just like mozz and some green (arugula?

Either way the two different extremes in one dish made it slightly confusing and not very pleasant to eat. I could have waited for my potatoes to cool down with hopes that they would warm my duck. Instead, I told the staff the issue I was having and they were extremely accommodating. I ordered the Market Burger to replace the duck hash and the burger was one of the best in Queens. Alright, it was the best burger I have had in Queens. Possibly one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. The service I experienced at this time was impeccable.My third visit I was quite disappointed. I returned during brunch to have the Market Burger, which I have stated is the best in Queens.Upon arriving, I was informed that there would be a 15 - 20 minute wait. Having my heart set on the burger, I decided to wait. While waiting I decided to sit at the bar and order a cup of coffee in the mean time. I told the person behind the bar that I was waiting on a table, but would like to order a cup of coffee while waiting. My coffee was served in a to go cup - which is perfectly fine if I was leaving. While sitting at the bar I was told I had to leave the bar and sit at one of the side benches so that they may accommodate other guests who planned on eating at the bar. I figured that was reasonable enough. Despite the hostess's tone, I understood the restaurant was busy and that they were probably experiencing some sort of stress due to the high volume. After waiting a little of 20 minutes and being shuffled around the restaurant, we were finally given a table. A table stuffed into the corner of the restaurant with folding chairs. Then we waited approximately 10 minutes before someone came over to our table after helping a table that was seated after ours. (Still trying to be understanding considering it was getting busy and I really wanted the burger!)So now, tucked away in the corner, waiting for someone to take our order, the hostess finally comes over and inquired if we would need another minute. We ordered. I asked to have the Market Burger and to my dismay I was told they did not have any more burgers.The whole experience just was not pleasant. I do believe they have good food. I just would not visit LIC during peak times (ie. dinner or 11:30-2 for brunch). Brunch started at 11.

LIC Market,5528,21-52 44th Dr,Long Island City,11101.0,142933,"I am becoming more and more excited about dining in the outer boroughs because of places like this. I was first enticed by LIC Market when I read about their mission to serve local and seasonal ingredients. With an ever-changing menu, I will definitely be back.We were served a tasty, charred julienned endive on a tangy bed of tapenade. The only thing missing was some crusty bread to sop it all up. Are you reading this review LIC? Give us some bread!I went with the Market Burger. It was juicy, tasty, and cheesy, just the way a good burger should be. I would've liked my bun to be a little softer, but that's nitpicking. The oyster mushroom hash, as others have said, was a refreshing alternative to starchy accompaniments. It was a nice blend of crispy bits, grease, and savory mushroom flavor. Fantastic!The brussels sprouts were chopped into a fine mix of bacon and seasonings, which helps reduce the semi-bitterness of the hearts. Simply delicious.For dessert, we we're treated to a blueberry crumble served in a mini cast iron pan with a side of heavy cream. Is there a better marriage than cream and a baked crust?

Lic Deli & Grocery,5529,2901 39th Ave,Long Island City,11101.0,198129,"I stayed at the Holiday Inn Manhattan View when I found this little dive.  The neighborhood is weird- on the same street there is a catholic church, lots of residences, three hotels, an abortion clinic, and some kind of auto repair place.  The neighborhood feels residential but the placement of these random hotels is just out of place. Anyway, the bodega on the corner- the LIC Deli- was the highlight of my stay.  They had a bangin' hot bar starting at breakfast. If you show up after 7pm, you risk an empty hot bar since it goes fast.  For breakfast I would have white rice (amazing white rice), a fried egg and a side of pork rinds (chicharones in Spanish). Totally negated my early morning runs on the hotel treadmill (not sure I would risk running on the street- some areas are desolate). For dinner, anything in the Latin food genre was good (they did try to do a baked Ziti but I was not impressed- stick to the Latin food).  Now, to address some earlier posts, the LIC Deli is NOT Mexican/Central American.  It is Puerto Rican and Dominican- very different.  No tacos here. This is straight up roasted pork, pork rinds, rice and pigeon peas (arroz con gandules). There is not an arepa or a tortilla in sight. This place is also great if you are staying with kids at the hotel. Pick up some hot food and have dinner in the room. The LIC Deli also has sandwiches, breakfast bagels, sodas, chips, ice cream- your typical bodega with American junk food.  Say hi to Rubio at the register. He is the Latin guy with the blonde hair.  Super nice and kept the line moving. He was also visibly upset when he found out Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy.  If you are in the area, give this place a try. But no need to make this a destination out of your way.

LIC Bagel,5531,3108 36th Ave,Astoria,11106.0,1419,"LIC Bagel is a cheap, fast, and casual food spot in Astoria near the 36 Ave stop on the NQ. We came here for breakfast. I ordered the pancakes and substituted the meat side for eggs. My dish came with three pancakes and the chef came out and brought us our food. The pancakes were more dense than I prefer but still good, and the eggs were simple. I did not like the artificial syrup they have, but I'm not surprised. Maple syrup is more expensive and people actually prefer the fake stuff (see Washington Post's March 2015 article)! I also ordered the orange carrot juice ($4.50) and it was refreshing and smooth.

Low and behold, one hungry lazy evening I took a walk with my daughter to investigate and check out this new Italian spot; And boy were we happy we did! The food was surprisingly very very good. I can't remember what day it was exactly but it was in December of 2012. The food was so great (I'll tell you what we ate in a sec) I returned a week or so later with a close friend who's also a foodie on December 28th of 2012. On this evening we met the owner who was the most polite, non-cocky, even spirited restaurant owner ever. We were dining right next to the chef without knowing before she introduced herself after overhearing me go on about how great the kale salad was. Her name is Serina Bass and she was also very inviting and polite. The family style atmosphere of Lido's is an A+. I haven't sat at the bar yet but intend to soon. Let's talk food; the lasagna bolognese.. incredible, this lasagna literally melts in your mouth with its obvious special high end ingredients. The pasta was so light and delicate it marinated on my tongue in the most glorious way! We had a few appetizers which were all great but the kicker was the kale salad. I have never tasted a vegetable dressed to the 9's like this one! Laced with white beans & large/thinly sliced fresh parmesan cheese tossed about. How they embedded that 'grilled' taste into the kale I'll never know and I don't have to worry about it as long as I can walk down the block and grab some! Just as I intend to do tonight... !! #Highly recommend Lido's",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,10.8999996185,"wave,restaurant owner,restaurant,chef,native,Lido,Harlem,walk,daughter,friend,food,food,lasagna bolognese,kale salad,foodie,spot,food,name,atmosphere,family style,bar,pasta,Italian,kale salad,kicker,vegetable,parmesan cheese,beans,taste,Serina Bass,A+,boy,kale,some,block,lasagna,appetizers,ingredients,mouth,way,tongue","7,1,2,1,1,2,2,4,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.181685432792,0.110024914145,0.095842666924,0.0764008536935,0.073365136981,0.0695945695043,0.043759804219,0.0389182493091,0.0351965017617,0.0266466550529,0.0216497890651,0.0215107090771,0.0171801503748,0.0122418440878,0.0121828299016,0.0118924463168,0.011039763689,0.0109694376588,0.0100246435031,0.00818669702858,0.00817578285933,0.00813685078174,0.00799751933664,0.00741434143856,0.00727094756439,0.00608371431008,0.00607839925215,0.00607839925215,0.00607343157753,0.00602306285873,0.00601408211514,0.00585281848907,0.00528478017077,0.00420569023117,0.00420569023117,0.00313873146661,0.00294952560216,0.00267726182938,0.00267726182938,0.00267430953681,0.00267430953681"

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,199319,"This place is beautiful. Very nice chic look, must look even better in the summer with the doors open. But the service wasn't so great. Our waiter's name was Attila. We found him very cold, no personality which I think is necessary for a waiter. While we were still eating our appetizers, he came over to ask us for our next meal. We felt rushed instead of relaxed, given that it seemed to be a very relaxing environment. We asked for a little more time, so we could finish our appetizer and then decide what we wanted for the entree and drinks. He came back a little later, we gave him our order, which was the NY Strip steak. We noticed that he didn't ask how we wanted them cooked, which is a basic question when someone orders steak. So before he walked away, my husband stopped him so that he could tell him how we wanted our steaks cooked. My husband also needed a few more minutes to decide on what drink he wanted since there drink menu is very extensive. He never actually came back to get that order so my husband never got a drink.There were 3 different bus boys who took good care of us, making sure we had water and removing our used plates from the table and also bringing our food over. We felt we had better service from them than the actual waiter who took our orders. He only kept coming over to see if we were done, instead of asking if we needed anything else, which again, made us feel rushed, He didn't ask if we wanted another drink or if we wanted desert. By the time we finished our meal, we wanted to leave. So when we asked for the check, he had it ready already, which again says that he was ready to rush us out. BTW, the place was 2/3 empty. No where near busy or packed. It was a Monday night. He pretty much stood around the whole time we were there, just looking around.For appetizer, my husband and I shared the roasted plum tomatoes option w/mozzarella and basil pesto on grilled bread. It was very delicious. It was honestly the best part of the meal. For entree, we had the NY strip steak which had good presentation. It looked great, but the steak had too much fat and cartilage that I had to cut out. It also was a little burnt so the taste of the steak was mixed with a black burnt taste. The garlic and parsley sauce was good and also the golden fries with butter.But the main course, the steak, was my least favorite out of everything I had.If I ever come back here, it would be for an actual Italian meal, maybe a pasta. And hopefully I will have a better waiter.

It is on the corner of 117 st and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in what can only be described as a neighborhood undergoing a renaissance. The restaurant was packed but we were seated right away. We ordered 3 courses to share . Our first course was the Roasted Mushrooms ,marscapone polenta,truffle oil and parmesan served in a sizzling castiron pan. This dish is nothing short of amazing. Talk about creamy delicious and flavor packed. A must have. Our second dish was spagetti and roasted veal meatballs in a san marzano tomato and basil sauce. The sauce was delicious but the meatballs were not as successful . I found them to be gristly under flavored and chewy. The service in dealing with the spagetti issue is the primary reason I am giving 5 stars. The waiter and manager were both very honest in their assessment of this dish and we were happily surprised they removed it from the bill. Our third course was the braised short rib in a potato puree and remalade. This dish was beyond our expectations. Moist, tender and succulent are an understatement on the flavors and delicasy of the dish. It was aromatic and piping hot, perfect and the gremalach was beyond anything id had to date. We somehow had enough room for desert and we had the bread pudding wit the rum marscapone and wafer.

You know how everyone loves this place? Yeah well, that's probably more about how drunk they were when they ate the food than the actual food. Maybe Lido is great at Italian fare, but a good brunch spot it is not. Honestly, if you mess up an omelette bad enough that although the customer is mildly buzzed they can still tell thats a sad omelette, then Houston we have a problem. Let me back up, we made a reservation and sat down, got the bottomless mimosas and got going. We noticed the mimosas tasted a bit watery but they were good enough so we weren't too discouraged. Then our food came. I got the pesto omelette with turkey sausages and my boyfriend got the pancakes. In their defense, he said the pancakes were ok. My omelette was another story. You know when you put egg in to oil thats not hot enough so it get kind of dark? Rookie mistake right? So I had a dark oily omelette, I understand they tried to do pesto in the omelette and that could've made it oily but no, just no. Plus some Superrr under seasoned turkey patty things..it was a sad meal. By the time we left we had headaches, I have a high tolerance and was barely tipsy so it didn't even occur to me it was an alcohol headache till my boyfriend mentioned he had a headache too later in the day.

She's a pretty amazing cook and since we're both big time foodies, I didn't want to go to yet another place that made us feel like ""we should have saved money and made better food at home"". But in this case....we probably should have. Upon arrival, I was not disappointed. The ambiance was very nice. A subtlly-upscale restaurant with lots of natural light and a tasteful decor. The service was a little slow especially considering there were only a few other parties there, but I got the feeling our waiter was picking up a lot of slack from the other employees who seemed like they spent most of their time standing around talking to each other. We got unlimited mimosas for brunch and I will admit that they did keep them coming! Even by our third glass, the mimosas were still delicious and never watered down...unlike a lot of the other so-called bottomless brunch dining experiences I've had in the city. For brunch we both got the braised short rib hash. Maybe we should have tried different things and split them- cause we were both completely underwhelmed. The short rib hash lacked flavor and texture. It kind of reminded me of fancy feast for humans. The eggs were a little over done, the side salad was drenched in whatever mediocre dressing it came with and the hollandaise sauce was almost non existent- which was doubly disappointing since the yolk of my poached egg was more solid than liquid. Maybe they doubled up on salad dressing to accommodate for the lack of hollandaise. Was it the worst thing I've ever eaten? No. Was it the best? Definitely not.

Shortly after ordering our entrees and drinks my friend actually turned up and advised that hostess that she was running late but ended up making it anyway and asked to be seated at which point the hostess rolled her eyes and actually ignored my friend to the point that she had to repeat herself 3 times and finally led her to our table. I want to mention that we were still seated at a table for 6 patrons despite the fact that only 5 of us showed up initially.  After my friend  was able to sit down, hostess with a stick up her ass literally put the menu so close to my friends face she felt physically threatened by this woman!

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,199737,"DISGUSTING SERVICE. Stay away from this place if you are smart. There is a young man working here named Erin, a lighter skinned Hispanic young male who will attempt to poison your food if you disagree with him. We went in with a few questions about one if the sauces on the menu and as we were trying to explain our point he became very belligerent and argumentative. I tried to call the manager over, whose name is Susana, to ask her about the dish and the Erin guy was so intimidating ( literally standing near her from behind so he could hear, and with a threatening demeanor)  that i couldn't even ask her, out of fear of his retaliation, and I ended up ordering the salmon dish. The dish wasn't too bad but it really wasn't what I wanted as this place has different types of pasta that I really wanted to try. Then, as the manager walked away and was out of sight, he walks in the middle of the restaurant to this other young male with long braids to his shoulder (also Hispanic/Latino) laughing and pointing at our table in a not so subtle manner.  My guest was over the age of 60 which was beyond inappropriate. When the food arrived a young pretty woman, somewhat short and Caucasian with curly hair had the food and gave it to Erin to bring over, as it was his table. He was only a few steps from our table but attempted to sneak our dinners back to where the bathroom area was. I nearly panicked with a heart attack until that same nice woman audibly asked him not to take the dinners away to a strange place in the back. Why would someone attempt to sneak your dish away near the toilet? This Erin guy is bad news and I am advising anyone who appreciates good restaurant service, appropriate behavior, and a respectful experience to stay away from this restaurant. The Owner Susanna should view this young man as a serious liability.

My wife and I moved to SOHA last year and since then we've already seen an incredible influx of progressive restaurants, bars, butchers, and cafes. Lido, is without a doubt, at the top of that list. The other night, we sat at the bar and ordered dinner and drinks as it is the best seat in the house. Our bartender (can't remember his name!!) was super personable, knowledgeable and professional. The new head chef chatted us up almost immediately and the rest of the staff followed suit in friendly accommodating service. While food is king, service is just as important and they nail both with a genuine disposition. The interiors are more reminiscent of a Hamptons Mediterranean spot than a traditional Harlem lounge with clean lines, ivory colors, and wood accents. The food could not have been better! I had the red snapper and my wife had the orecchiette pasta. We started with the Salted Cod, which is whipped up with potato on top a grilled crostini. It tasted like a solid version of the best clam chowder on earth and at only $4.50, it was a steal.They have a great drink menu, sizable bourban and single malt list, and great wines to pair with your dish . We had the jalepeno-infused gin drink (can't remember the name of it) and had to order a second round as it was sooooo good and spicy - not to mention perfectly balanced.

After hours of walking and getting lost, I stepped into Lido. The environment of the restaurant is just my speed. It's quaint, clean, has a great seating and an overall cool vibe. It's very pretty and is a place you could definitely sit for a drink and chat for hours!I ordered the brussel sprouts which weren't the greatest. They were a little bitter and tasted mildly of vinegar. Also enough of the bacon fat was not kept in the dish so the bacon was flavorless and did not compliment brussel sprouts as it usually does. Although I did get them without ricotta, I don't think it would have impacted the taste much.The Salt Cod Fritters were really good. Its like a less fishy version of a crab cake in bite sized portions! Loved them and the sauce was great. Now lets discuss the CHOCOLATE BUNDINO! That is what turned everything around, food wise! I dream of that little chocolate, olive oil, and sea salt dessert. It was great. The bartender recommended the last two items which did not disappoint. Overall a great meal, with very friendly and helpful staff. It also is a neighborhood type place where the staff has regular customers and the customers know each other.

Understand we have a very diverse clientele in most restaurants and I love it. This place rubbed me wrong from the moment we asked the busser who poured our water if we could get some orange juice. He was SO nice and said of course and left. The waitress then came by to ask if we wanted something to drink ""Yep, we asked that nice busser man"" she demeaningly retorted ""Well, if you want something you cant ask him anything, so what do you want? Juice?"" It was rude. Sorry. And I'm not even sensitive. Then we noticed all the bussers were black guys and all the waitresses and hostesses were white. Which isnt a problem, but they demeaningly spoke to their ""second teir"" staff. It attracted a certain clientele which was very bazaar for the location. So for the food I'll make it short. I think it was my fault for going to Italian for brunch, but I mean come on. I got the poached eggs with veal meatballs which I could have made at home. My sister got the polenta which was fine but floating in sauce.

We started off by sharing the the salt cod fritters and parmesan polenta tots, both which were fine but nothing special. We also shared a couple carafes of the white wine sangria, which I really enjoyed. For my main entree I ordered the strip steak and asked for it to be done medium. However it came out very, very well done. The waiter was very kind and sent it back to the kitchen right away, and the manager also stopped by to apologize personally and offer us desserts on the house, which I really appreciated. My second steak was done medium, but unfortunately was way too salty. At this point I decided to just eat the steak as it was.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,84041,"If in a name of an establishment one can immediately get a sense of what its proprietor(s) purport to evoke, then 'Lido', a new eatery in Harlem, certainly captures this concept. Italian for 'beach' and, aptly named after 'Lido di Venezia', just outside Venice in northern Italy, Lido patrons are treated to a dining experience reminiscent of being seaside in the Italian countryside. Conveniently located on Frederick Douglas Boulevard,  just a couple blocks from the B, C subway stop at 116th St, Lido is becoming quite a neighborhood gem and, an impeccable location for downtowners and uptowners alike - a perfect meeting spot, right in the middle of the island.The setting is inviting with a warm ambiance and consists of a full bar to your left (as you enter) and ample sitting in the main dining area. The décor is modern but classically so, with a tinge of understated elegance. It is suitable for a date, groups or solo diners (there's room at the bar to also have a meal), so whatever the occasion, it's versatile enough to accommodate whatever purpose.I love the food. The menu features a melange of 'ASSAGGINI' (appetizers/first course), INSALATA & ANTIPASTI, PASTA & SECONDI, and Dolci (dessert), etc. and, specially selected daily specials which are just as mouthwatering. I found most all my selections to be simply scrumptious. Some standouts for me on the menu are: as an antipasti, the 'White Polenta, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Truffle Oil' and the 'Marinated Beet Salad, Ribbiola di Roccaverano Fritter, Pistachio, Watercress, Saba', for a secondi pasta choice, the 'Ricotta Ravioli, Eggplant, Mint, Pine Nuts, Lemon' and the 'Gnocchi, Guanciale, Truffle Butter, Pecorino', and to cap things off, for dessert, the classic 'Apple Tart' - though at Lido, it's anything but. So if you're in the mood to treat your palate and it just happens to be Italian you fancy, head up to Lido; it promises to be worth the trip. And, who knows, you may just spot a celebrity or two - they're rumored to frequent the establishment. ;)",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.800000011921,8.0,"Lido,sense,establishment,eatery,name,proprietor(s),concept,bar,Harlem,beach,menu,White Polenta,Lido di Venezia,specials,neighborhood gem,dining experience,seaside,countryside,patrons,couple,C subway stop,décor,dessert,PASTA,ANTIPASTI,ambiance,dining area,sitting,left,location,setting,island.,middle,meeting spot,downtowners,uptowners,tinge,elegance,groups,occasion,meal,room,diners,food,course,INSALATA,SECONDI,appetizers,selections,Italian,Venice,Frederick Douglas Boulevard,St,B,dessert,melange,Eggplant,Mint,Guanciale,things,Dolci,ASSAGGINI,trip,palate,mood,celebrity,Ricotta Ravioli,Apple Tart,Pecorino,Gnocchi,Pine Nuts,Lemon,Truffle Butter,menu,antipasti,establishment.,Pistachio,Watercress,pasta choice,standouts,Ribbiola di Roccaverano Fritter,Saba,Marinated Beet Salad,Truffle Oil,Parmigiano Reggiano,Mushroom Ragu","2,7,7,3,7,1,7,2,2,2,7,7,2,7,6,7,2,2,1,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,7,3,4,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,3,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,5,4,7,7,7,7,5,6,6,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,6,6,7","0.165856868029,0.0645635351539,0.0573764592409,0.050291147083,0.050291147083,0.050291147083,0.050291147083,0.031854018569,0.0299268178642,0.0240542050451,0.018559422344,0.0152134234086,0.0142719903961,0.0134075367823,0.0103961834684,0.00920750852674,0.00920750852674,0.00920750852674,0.00920750852674,0.00916037615389,0.00916037615389,0.00754845701158,0.00641366280615,0.00641366280615,0.00641366280615,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00618633255363,0.00616382947192,0.00616382947192,0.00614643050358,0.00614643050358,0.00614643050358,0.00614643050358,0.00614643050358,0.00584273273125,0.00561185507104,0.00561185507104,0.00561185507104,0.00561185507104,0.00560090597719,0.00545400520787,0.00545400520787,0.00542605854571,0.00542605854571,0.00542605854571,0.00477494113147,0.00424650777131,0.00417776498944,0.00417776498944,0.00417776498944,0.00417776498944,0.0033228113316,0.0033228113316,0.00288825854659,0.00288825854659,0.00288825854659,0.00288440287113,0.0028797488194,0.00247328262776,0.00247328262776,0.00247328262776,0.00247328262776,0.00247328262776,0.00247328262776,0.00209453213029,0.00209453213029,0.0019515916938,0.00183241232298,0.00183241232298,0.00183241232298,0.00171981926542,0.00108452455606,0.00108452455606,0.00108452455606,0.00108452455606,0.00108452455606,0.00108452455606"

The server did not arrive for more than 15 minutes, and he was to-the-point and brash. My husband ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu and I ordered from the regular menu.The Restaurant Week menu is varied and carries many items are from their usual menu. However, the portions are way too small, and leave you hungry.We had the tomato and mozzarella salad to start. Food runners simply auction off and drop the food. There is no offer of cheese or pepper, even Olive Garden does that. We had the crab and lobster ravioli (Restaurant Week portion) and I had the grilled salmon. Both plates were delicious, but my $24 salmon was less than a 3 oz portion. I was still hungry after finishing it.At the end of our meal, we watched a server run by with a salmon plate. It was clearly more than double my portion. I spoke with a woman, who said she was the manager. I asked her why that salmon dish looked so different than mine. She told me that was the ""regular portion"", not ""restaurant week portion"". I told her that I had also ordered the regular one, and I received one that was half of the size. She told me that I should have informed her earlier and it was too late now. How is a customer supposed to know this if  it's their first time here?! She and the hostess apologized, but no offers were made to resolve their error. I paid full price for a half portion; we left the restaurant unhappy and still hungry.I went home, and had a bowl of milk and cereal. The food is great, but the management is very poor.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,131316,"When people ask me what I like to do for fun, one of things that tops my list is Bottomless Brunch.  So when my sister who is really into brunch suggested this place, I was totally for it. I live in DC, and I believe it has spoiled me because I was a little underwhelmed. There are restaurants in DC that offer all you can eat delicious food and mimosas for $39! Or even less than that, depending on the place. I've gotten accustomed to leaving brunch spots in DC full and tipsy.Here's the scoop. Being familiar with the area, my sister suggested that we arrive as soon as Lido opened since we didn't make a reservation. At 10:45 on a rainy Sunday, we walked into the cute space to find about 5 tables and a few people at the bar. It was a perfect time to come since it wasn't full at all. After checking in the with the hostess, she informed us that she had a table we could have, but we'd need to vacate by 12:30 pm since it was reserved. Knowing that we had less than 2 allotted hours for bottomless mimosas put a little pressure on me to get my mimosas worth, but I think I handled it like a champ.Now about the menu. It's limited, in my opinion. And I have never seen so much hollandaise on one menu in my life! Not much on there was speaking to me, so I ended up ordering the Smoked Salmon Benedict. Yes, with hollandaise. It was served on two small English muffins, and a small side salad. Notice that I've used the word ""small"" twice. There's a reason for that. For $18, this was a very small serving. The meal itself was decent, definitely not anything to write home about. When it was over, I realized I was still hungry. I actually had to order a side dish of potatoes to get full. All in all, I think this particular entrée needs another side dish with it.As for the $16 mimosas, they were good and pretty strong. My glass was refilled and I never had to seek out my waiter, so kudos for that.  Will I come back? Maybe if I'm in the area again, but I can't say that I'll make a special trip.",3.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",3,1,0.10000000149,11.3999996185,"sister,place,things,one,people,list,fun,Bottomless Brunch,restaurants,brunch,DC,brunch spots,mimosas,tables,place,area,underwhelmed,food,scoop,Lido,mimosas,mimosas,serving,people,table,menu,menu,hollandaise,space,bar,hostess,pressure,champ.,opinion,life,all,meal,reservation,side dish,anything,home,potatoes,entrée,side dish,mimosas,area,kudos,waiter,glass,it.As,trip,reason,hollandaise,word,muffins,side salad,Smoked Salmon Benedict,English","1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,2,2,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7","0.148309379816,0.124702923,0.12041451782,0.0670536011457,0.0549096427858,0.0481208860874,0.0481208860874,0.0438966751099,0.0357929356396,0.028867430985,0.023695666343,0.0171844456345,0.0117947328836,0.0105287088081,0.0099420985207,0.00989985093474,0.00875654723495,0.00872471369803,0.00868004187942,0.00830331072211,0.00786550249904,0.00719825038686,0.0070589473471,0.00667460681871,0.00665576756001,0.00608362676576,0.006070765201,0.006070765201,0.00584017019719,0.00584017019719,0.00582368252799,0.00581665430218,0.00532296998426,0.00531710404903,0.00531171401963,0.00495105748996,0.00471337325871,0.00454039638862,0.00450582662597,0.00420525856316,0.00394700979814,0.00394224422053,0.00394002348185,0.0038191578351,0.00368978548795,0.00311314943247,0.0027264028322,0.0027264028322,0.0027264028322,0.00233243010007,0.00211350526661,0.00201835483313,0.00198596576229,0.00182493927423,0.00173599936534,0.00173599936534,0.0010291839717,0.00102744204924"
Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,24577,"My story with Lido started in a completely unbiased way. I believe those ones usually last forever. In fact, I am happy to make what it is a little trip for me as many times as I can to enjoy Lido's food.  On the months I was on an apartment hunting in the area, the aesthetics of Lido call my attention enough for us to get brunch right away. On a completely virgin state of mind, by the means of not even knowledge of Yelp rating, reviews, or any people's opinion whatsoever, I thought at the end how was even possible I never heard of a place like this. Decor and aesthetics however, are just appearance; in many occasions they may fail to deliver what really matters. Lido is a perfect place in the noncritical, but Lido also deliver on the Trinity of the five stars: wonderful food, wonderful service, pleasant ambiance, vibrant experiences. I know, I just told you more than a Trinity; maybe I should put down five, one for every star I am giving to them. But then I would have to think about more. Be aware of Lido's popularity. Many locals seems to have it as a brunch and dining destination. Me, and perhaps a few others, were like travelers that go back for the sake of a five stars. The approach is very simple: classic Italian dishes, clean flavors fresh ingredients. Try their salads, particularly the Sugar Snap Pea, Arugula, Mint, and Basil with torn Burrata. Also the Warm Salad of Arugula, Roasted Pears, Walnuts and Shaved Parmesan. We heard about the grilled kale salad, and would probably be my next. Impressed also for their Omelet with Mushroom, Guanciale, Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese and you can also make changes in your dish if you like. Without hesitation or complaints. Intrigued enough about Lido, I can tell you now I may didn't hear about it because my ears weren't open enough. Apparently, current Lido's chef is a James Beard Award Winner: Chef Serena Bass*. Google her. There is plenty of reasons for you to expect Lido to be a 5 stars. But you know what? even when an awarded chef provides a logical explanation, we also know how many proclaimed chefs fail in your expectations. She is been in charge for just a year, and apparently, the previous was as good as the former**.  I don't know about that, but in a sense, it corroborates the need for many aspects to make a solid 5 stars out of a place.

The french toast was great, the berries super fresh, and the whipped cream...well how can you go wrong. It was super comfortable. No wait to be seated.

The bf liked his meal, which I believe was baked eggs of some sort. Cons:It was a bit of a long wait for food and for the check and our water was noticeably not cold.

We were extremely skeptical initially because the place that preceded them was terrible - but what a surprise!-My boyfriend and I were both Italian majors in college, and take ""Italian"" food very seriously. We both lived in Italy for one year in Emilia Romagna, which is one of the culinary capitals, and his father is a native so he also grew up eating Italian food. Not that we're experts, but we definitely don't go to shitty Italian restaurants and have tried several of NYCs best with his family. I'd say any meal here is wonderful, especially if you live down the street. However, I have to say I have a soft spot for their winter brunch options which I think are more creative than the standard fare you'll find downtown. Brunch would definitely be worth the trip to Harlem if you don't live here. The White Polenta, Mushroom Ragu, Poached Eggs & Parmesan is the PERFECT Italian breakfast, their frittatas are legit, veal meatballs & poached eggs is stellar, and they have an omelet with guanciale on the menu?! Ummm.... hello! For $12 + $7 for unlimited mimosas until 3:30 - you've got yourself a deal with any of these options.Dinner is good too, and certainly passes our standards for Italian food, but it's nothing to go out of your way for in a sea of fantastic Italian restaurants in NYC, which is why I left off one star. However, if you're in the area, definitely give it a shot!

FILM AT ELEVEN.I chose Lido to celebrate my birthday mainly because it advertised bottomless mimosas, plus the incredible sounding menu made it all the more appealing. I placed the reservation well in advance for 16 people. The hostess made it very clear to me that my party would not be seated if we were not all present AND if 2 or more people were no shows I would be charged $20 per person. When sending out the invitations to my friends and family I stressed both of these points urging them to please be on time. The day before the brunch the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation. At the time of the call, the group had dropped from 16 to 15.  The next day we were there not only on time but we were early! However we were made to wait for 20 minutes. That was strike 1. After making such a big deal of letting me know I needed to be there at noon because ""we're soooo busy blah blah blah and those are tables we could use blah blah blah!"", I expected to be seated on time. Here comes strike 2: When we were finally being seated, it turned out we were actually now a group of 17 instead of 15. Well I guess those 2 extra bodies made the hostess's brain explode because she couldn't accommodate us. Or rather she WOULD NOT accommodate us. She was very clear that she could not make any room and therefore my friends could not be seated. So they left and took their business across the street to Harlem Tavern and missed being a part of my birthday celebration. In retrospect we should have gone with them. By the way, did I mention it was my birthday and this hostess ALMOST ruined it for me? She made zero attempt to accommodate us even though there was a two top right in front of our table that would have been perfect for, oh I don't know, TWO PEOPLE?! She claimed it was already reserved. We were just about done with our meal before that reservation showed up. She could have seated my friends at that table but refused. There are so many cute spots in that immediate area that I could have chosen. Harlem Tavern, The Park 112, 5 and Diamond all come to mind but I chose Lido. I regret it.  Rant over.The only saving grace was the food and our waiter Aaron. The food was indeed delicious! Everybody was very happy with their entrees. Aaron made sure that no one's glass was ever empty. He had a good attitude and did his best to make sure we were having a good time which is more than I can say for the hostess who did not check in with us once! I will never go back and will make sure to tell anyone who is curious about my experience.

We live a few blocks away and both work from home, so we always look for places in the area that are open for lunch during the week (not so many options available). Lido was sometimes our choice for lunch since they have the $10 lunch menu that had pretty decent options. To our surprise, when we went there for lunch yesterday, we found out that they have removed two of the best items from the $10 lunch menu  - the burguer and the pasta option. Now the special lunch menu is so boring. I ended up ordering the spaghetti with tomato sauce, which I thought was very expensive for a simple pasta dish in a lunch menu ($17). I wouldn't mind paying that price if I were served a nice dish, however the noodles were very overcooked and the sauce was nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the egg panini and was not impressed.I do have to say that I really like the decor and ambiance at Lido, and I did have a good experience there before over brunch.

Brunch is way better than Dinner.If I was just rating brunch, Lido deserves 4 stars hands down.  But, unfortunately, I've also had dinner at Lido, which was exceptionally underwhelming.Brunch...I had a superb time during my Brunch at Lido.  The Unlimited Mimosas had a lot to do that.  I may or may not have had nine... or so. I had the Baked Eggs as my entree.  This is served with cream, fontina, spinach and prosciutto atop three or four large cubed potatoes.  This was delicious and well balanced, the flavors and textures blended beautifully.  It was also fairly hearty, yet light.  I felt satisfied afterwards, without feeling stuffed. This is the perfect place if you're looking for a savory non-traditional breakfast -- no pancakes or heavy starches here.  I thought this to be a great change from the usual.  I did not have my signature eggs benedict, but the Baked Eggs were an excellent alternate.  Dinner....So after this great brunch, I was raving about Lido and excited to try them for dinner.  Big disappointment.  Most of the entrees sounded great on the menu, but were just lackluster in taste.My friend and I started with a Crostino course of Salt Cod & Potato and Prosciutto & Reggiano. The former was interesting, I wasn't expecting the texture to be as smooth as it was -- it was essentially a wittle bit of cod, with lots of potato. The latter was as expected.  Next, we shared the Dungeness Crab Cake.  This was ugh, such a disappointment.  It had more breading than I would have preferred, very little lump crab meat (mostly crab mush, and things that perhaps should have added flavor).  I had the Pappardelle, which was essentially served with a lamb ragu.  I added an insane and unfortunate amount of salt.  Like seriously, I couldn't taste a thing.  My friend had the Spaghetti, which is served with veal meat balls.  He found it underwhelming and I shared his sentiment.  I thought maybe the dessert would be a source of redemption.  Nope.  I didn't even finish my Apple Tart.The decor and atmosphere are excellent. The service is fine.  I enjoyed the Sidro cocktail.Skip dinner (or perhaps go and order things besides what I ate), but definitely do brunch.",3.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,16.8999996185,"Brunch,texture,Lido,Stars,brunch,Brunch,place,dinner,friend,stars,Potato,Dinner.,Unlimited Mimosas,Spaghetti,potatoes,entree,prosciutto,flavors,brunch,lot,fontina,spinach,cream,dinner,Dinner,starches,change,textures,breakfast,disappointment,entrees,former,latter,friend,cod,light,pancakes,signature eggs benedict,alternate,menu,Most,crab mush,Pappardelle,course,lots,brunch,thing,sentiment,salt,lamb ragu,amount,veal meat balls,dinner,Prosciutto & Reggiano,Salt Cod,things,source,dessert,service,Crostino,taste.My,Baked Eggs,redemption,decor,atmosphere,things,disappointment,flavor,lump crab meat,breading,Tart.,Apple,Skip,Sidro,Dungeness Crab Cake","4,7,2,7,4,4,7,4,1,7,7,1,3,6,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,3,3,1,7","0.114828377962,0.0792578682303,0.0755240693688,0.0690103769302,0.0396751686931,0.0394733548164,0.0387384966016,0.0375324040651,0.0361864902079,0.0330356918275,0.0257015209645,0.0223995279521,0.0164868365973,0.0138069000095,0.0124525800347,0.0113500189036,0.0113278953359,0.0113087659702,0.0100235780701,0.00998316705227,0.0099126836285,0.0099126836285,0.0099126836285,0.00952761340886,0.00952761340886,0.00836239941418,0.00814199633896,0.00763724930584,0.00760650262237,0.00757667608559,0.00757048418745,0.00723273586482,0.00722750043496,0.00692804157734,0.00692272232845,0.00667246431112,0.00665552122518,0.00664144894108,0.00664144894108,0.00662399921566,0.00662399921566,0.00633934186772,0.00607225205749,0.00606176815927,0.00605711294338,0.00582902599126,0.00566200260073,0.0051746442914,0.00515269953758,0.00451073097065,0.00450818985701,0.00450342753902,0.00441014487296,0.00410214578733,0.00410214578733,0.00390766467899,0.00381544954143,0.00381544954143,0.0038103563711,0.00358893629164,0.00358893629164,0.00347652332857,0.00311487982981,0.0031120586209,0.00292087160051,0.00248778867535,0.00241226190701,0.00226264400408,0.00226264400408,0.00226264400408,0.00184203509707,0.00184203509707,0.00184047757648,0.00184047757648,0.00134867371526"

The bacon was soggy/mushy and there wasn't enough goat cheese. My friend enjoyed her food, so I may have to try that next time. The potatoes could have used a little more seasoning as well, but they weren't bad. FYI - there are only two separate bathrooms for restaurant goers to use.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,156972,"MODIFIED REVIEW:After having dinner at Lido, I thought to myself ""Men.... maybe I should have dined here a year or so ago"" when this establishment first opened because my experience really didn't live up to the 'excitement' that I've read about in other reviews. Why didn't I experience the aforementioned thrill of dining at Lido?  Maybe, the stars were not aligned that day or, it was the approach that I took to dining there.  I think it was mostly the latter.  Regardless, if you read my reviews, I dislike leaving negative feedback because running a restaurant business is extremely challenging: there are so many intangible factors that can have a positive or perilous affect.Anyway, I used OpenTable to book my table for 2 adults.  Sadly, the restaurant informed me that they didn't receive my online reservation request.  That's not Lido's fault, it was an OpenTable online application issue.  Some people are always quick to blame a restaurant for anything. Keep it positive peeps.  Regardless, the hostess said that she will get me what appeared to be the only table available that night (Wednesday) and I was appreciative of that.  Seat location on a 1 to 10 scale: 4 - I'll explain more later but I decided to deal with it because this was my first time and I wanted to take in the Lido experience.  I also brought a friend with me.Appetizer: Calamari -  For some reason, i thought it was a bit over fried but nothing to die about.  Maybe, I was being too subjective.  Maybe, I was moody.  Lol.  Regardless, I thought there was no need for me to complain or send it back  Yup, I still went ahead and devoured it. Entree: Special of the Day - Ravioli with pumpkin filling.  Overall, on a 1 to 10 scale?  7  It was very DELICIOUS...but....the only problem was that the portions were for a super model trying to lose weight. :)  I'm 6'3 and I came with an appetite.My date later informed me that her entree (Brussel sprouts) was a bit oily or overcooked.  But she said her veal meatballs were good.My Harlem Renaissance beer tasted great and she enjoyed her Prosecco.Dessert was also very delicious, which I'm glad I didn't skip.Interior DesignThe environment and interior design of the restaurant is well thought out, cute and appears cozy, especially IF you snag a decent table.  Unfortunately, that night, our table was just not optimal because I was not able to properly face my companion.   My seat was hedged next to a column and my back was 3 feet from the bar, which was the main source of foot traffic into the dining area.  The set up of the table did not allow my companion and I to truly face each other or be in close body contact with each other which negated on the dining experience.  Normally, one could just correct that but It appeared to be the only table available at that time and I was eager to eat some food.Overall summary: I've lived in Harlem for ages and I along with old and new residents are gung-ho to see well-designed/themed restaurants pop up on Frederick Douglas Avenue and, in Harlem, in general. I found the interior design of the establishment to be cozy, clean and warm.  I also found it to be a bit tight as not spacious enough. But this is New York: space is at a premium. Will I be back?  At first, I thought I wouldn't because the overall dining experience was not as expected.  I equated it to the amount of money that I spent and I felt unfulfilled because I spent 2 weeks in Rome, a decade ago, and their dining experiences spoiled me. I was seeking to replicate that experience at Lido.  But upon further research that week, this is the principle, below, that I failed to apply at Lido, so it's not entirely their fault: ""The Italian menu is designed so that you choose dishes from various categories rather than only one. (So, if you're a hungry giant like me, come focused. Lol) For lunch you will have a plate of pasta (a primo), cleared away once it is done to make room for the next plate (a secondo) which will have a meat or fish on it. After the meat comes the salad or vegetables (contorno). For dessert, Italians usually have fruit or nuts."" I had Grappa. Chink!Now, after doing that research, and thanks to the owner and chef for reaching out to me to express their concern, I'm looking forward to dining there again to seek a diff. experience.  Based on my appetite, I'll make sure that I come with heavy pocket$, and without a date.

While Lido is a little out of the way for most people, it's worth it. Each person in our party of 4 chose a different breakfast entree and no one was left unsatisfied. The short rib hash with poached eggs was out of this world as were the respective omelettes my friends ordered. Another stand out dish was the polenta with poached egg, I've never had polenta as well prepared nor an egg so well poached. Another great add on for brunch that a lot of restaurants will offer is unlimited mimosas, which Lido offers for an additional $15 with a 2 hour time limit.

The chicken milanese and spaghetti with meatballs are both very good. The garlic mash that's served with the chicken is mind-blowing. I've tried and also liked the caesar salad, the polenta fries, and the cod fritters, though I think prices across the board are a little inflated, especially for the not-huge portion sizes (particularly for the polenta fries and fritters). The chocolate budino is a dark chocolate mousse-like dish drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. I was a little nervous to try it, but have been dreaming about it since. Rich, savory, and surprising-what more could you ask for? Pro Tip: Try the white sangria with passion fruit. Amazing. Service is good, but on my first visit, I witnessed something I personally find unacceptable. While walking into the restaurant, I saw a bus boy standing outside the spot and catcalling a passerby. Street harassment is never welcome, never okay,  and honestly it's so unprofessional to see someone doing that when they are supposed to be acting as a representative of the business. Just gross.

We were a group of 11 and, as we were warned, we couldn't sit down until most of the group was there. However we somehow all showed up within 15 minutes of the reservation (#groupwin) and they seated us no problem. I ordered the White Polenta with truffle oil, mushroom ragout, Parmesan, and poached eggs. It was delish. This kind of dish is easy to make too salty, but a Lido did it just right. It was just the right amount of savory with some cheesiness, the mushrooms, and the polenta cooks just right. I finished the whole thing! Yum. Of course I can't forget to mention the bottomless mimosas for only $14. They were good too! The waiter was very attentive and made sure purses were always full.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,6588,"Late Restaurant Week Winter 2016 review for January 20. Came here with my friend for restaurant week. I had Lido bookmarked for a few months, and finally able to try their food. I made an early reservation at 5:30pm, and naturally, when I arrived, the place was empty. No complaints there. I figured the restaurant would start filling up after 7. Inside, it's a cute little restaurant. Comfortable seats, good lighting, nice bar setup. Restaurant week menu seemed good, which was another reason why I decided to make Lido my 1st stop for Restaurant Week. We started off with 2 glasses of Pinot Noir. The red wine was light, fruity, and smooth. Very nice. For apps, I had the Roasted Pumpkin & Apple soup, and my friend had the Crostino that was served with burrata. For entrees, I paid the $6 supplement for the Grilled Salmon filet, cooked medium. She had the Roasted Duck Risotto. And for dessert, I had the bread pudding and she had the Bittersweet chocolate brownie w/ vanilla gelato.I wasn't impressed with both my apps and my dessert. My pumpkin soup was way too peppery, and watered down. My friend's burrata crostino though, was delicious and flavorful! I tried a spoonful of my friend's Duck risotto and it was good. Creamy risotto, w/ bits of duck in it. Not bad. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly. Flaky, moist, fresh ingredients and perfectly seasoned! And for dessert, I thought my bread pudding w/ some kinda dried fruit that I still can't identify and a scoop of ice cream seemed rather busy and a poor combination of flavors. My friend's chocolate brownie dessert was impressive though. Overall, despite the underwhelming apps and dessert, I would still rate my restaurant week experience at Lido as 4 stars because of the attentive service and the quality and execution of my salmon entree. I will definitely be back to try their brunch food someday..from their pictures, brunch looks pretty legit.",4.0 star rating,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,18.2000007629,"reason,review,food,restaurant,friend,restaurant,salmon entree,Lido,Restaurant Week Winter 2016,reservation,restaurant,soup,bread pudding w,place,friend,complaints,lighting,bar setup,seats,dessert,dessert,friend,apps,entrees,pumpkin soup,burrata crostino,red wine,chocolate brownie dessert,apps,chocolate brownie w,burrata,bread pudding,1st stop,glasses,filet,medium,supplement,friend,dessert,duck,vanilla,brunch food,spoonful,apps,Grilled Salmon,restaurant,flavors,fruit,scoop,ice cream,combination,Crostino,Roasted Duck Risotto,Pinot Noir,Apple,Bittersweet,brunch,experience,stars,service,quality,execution,pictures,friend,dessert,Duck risotto,w,risotto,bits,ingredients","7,5,7,2,1,2,7,2,4,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,2,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,3,5,4,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.138529673219,0.0650795027614,0.0584655031562,0.0489899292588,0.0445954687893,0.0434938520193,0.0347713381052,0.0328821390867,0.0322557538748,0.0308545771986,0.026068918407,0.0228414218873,0.0179362241179,0.0140987681225,0.0120185986161,0.0117763942108,0.0117065412924,0.0117065412924,0.0117065412924,0.0112518928945,0.0102976262569,0.0102822799236,0.0098718944937,0.00986263435334,0.00977883022279,0.00977175496519,0.00940157379955,0.00913664046675,0.00901071541011,0.00901071541011,0.00897971726954,0.00895613338798,0.00789392460138,0.00788339506835,0.00784986373037,0.00784986373037,0.00784986373037,0.00765193020925,0.00764812901616,0.00750659545884,0.00717154378071,0.00699376687407,0.00688904570416,0.00669186655432,0.0058409855701,0.00582275120541,0.00533087132499,0.00533087132499,0.00533087132499,0.00533087132499,0.00533087132499,0.00531769078225,0.00531769078225,0.00466802390292,0.00465252436697,0.00424625445157,0.00400414364412,0.00368718174286,0.00368718174286,0.00368718174286,0.00368718174286,0.00368718174286,0.00368541781791,0.00336878700182,0.00335882254876,0.00294724968262,0.00294533325359,0.00294533325359,0.00234355544671,0.00233940500766"

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,1685,"Lido, what a beautiful looking restaurant for this side of town.  Feels like this restaurant would be more at home in the village but it's a good thing restaurants like these open up to help improve the overall neighborhood.  Unfortunately, although aesthetically pleasing Lido fails to deliver on the quality of its food.  I came here for brunch today and although the menu looked quite appetizing, the delivery fell flat on its face.  The service was attentive, the kitchen was putting out dishes quickly, but unfortunately the execution of the food is borderline unacceptable and failing to deliver dining satisfaction in terms of flavor, texture, and value.First and foremost, the portions are small at Lido, so if you're eating brunch don't expect to be leaving perhaps satiated if you're a man but certainly not full.  I ordered the veal meatballs and poached eggs with broccoli rabe.  When I think of meatballs at restaurants like this, I think of something large like you would find at the meatball shop.  Instead imagine being served three meatballs that were probably the same size as your grocery store frozen variety.  The meatballs were essentially cooked on a small cast iron pan with broccoli rabe, marinara thrown over the top, two poached eggs plopped on top, and a single slice of grilled baguette thrown in.  One of the poached eggs was over cooked while the other one was perfectly done, the meatballs tasted of nothing, and the marinara sauce had a flavor reminiscent of your favorite canned variety of Ragu.  Truly a depressing dish especially since the amount of bread given wasn't even close to enough to pick up the rest of the tomato sauce.  Now since I was having brunch with the gf's mother who came into visit, I proceeded to polish off half of her grilled chicken panini  sandwich with pesto.  First, the sandwich lacked the characteristic grill marks of a panini, the chicken was slightly over cooked, and like everything I had in my last dish, bland.  Yes, it was so bland I could barely discern the pesto.  I guess the highlight of my meal was my coffee, at least that was done well....",2.0 star rating,"Seattle, WA",3,1,-0.10000000149,8.39999961853,"Lido,restaurant,restaurant,meatballs,man,side,town,highlight,thing restaurants,delivery,eggs,home,village,neighborhood,mother,brunch,dishes,execution,service,meatballs,food,food,veal meatballs,quality,face,kitchen,restaurants,menu,brunch,flavor,eggs,broccoli rabe,half,variety,top,broccoli rabe,top,texture,terms,dining satisfaction,meatball shop,something,size,rest,portions,grocery store,cast iron pan,marinara,baguette,slice,brunch,tomato sauce,pesto,chicken panini sandwich,sandwich,panini,visit,gf,grill marks,chicken,dish,pesto,one,everything,meal,least,dish,marinara sauce,amount,variety,flavor,nothing,bread,Ragu","2,2,2,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,1,4,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.290693074465,0.0882972627878,0.0518735982478,0.050288580358,0.0389766357839,0.0363341234624,0.0363341234624,0.0276738684624,0.0249063968658,0.0190168526024,0.0174069367349,0.0173873454332,0.0173873454332,0.0173873454332,0.0146567299962,0.0082892505452,0.00826589111239,0.00805720966309,0.00785594806075,0.00774809997529,0.00756847811863,0.0075197275728,0.00669744610786,0.00662338547409,0.00659931590781,0.00658070622012,0.00635380065069,0.00627354811877,0.00544416671619,0.0050792330876,0.00507228821516,0.00506751984358,0.00474244728684,0.00462075974792,0.00461387215182,0.00461387215182,0.00461387215182,0.00444441800937,0.00444441800937,0.00444441800937,0.00442551681772,0.00442551681772,0.00441803783178,0.00432093488052,0.00417166156694,0.00404315209016,0.00403712363914,0.00403712363914,0.00403712363914,0.00403712363914,0.00377658288926,0.00343889486976,0.0034351053182,0.0034351053182,0.0034316231031,0.0034316231031,0.00300552719273,0.00300552719273,0.00300247990526,0.00283754430711,0.00261246575974,0.00237391493283,0.00216667191125,0.00207888497971,0.00207511684857,0.00207511684857,0.00198082253337,0.00160923798103,0.00157616881188,0.00151037168689,0.00151037168689,0.00132136303,0.00131976674311,0.000782067596447"

To start off, it took about 15 min for the waitress to finally take our orders. About midway through waiting for our food, my glass was tipped over by someone walking by and it shattered- mimosa EVERYWHERE. A hostess saw it happen, made eye contact with me, and walked away. She didn't even signal someone to come clean it up. We had to flag down someone on the waitstaff ourselves- and all they did was sweep the glass off the table and the floor (and in doing this, swept a shard onto me that got stuck in my leg). They left the table AND THE FLOOR wet. No one brought us extra napkins and I had to request someone to bring another glass. I would love to say I'm being dramatic and it was probably a fluke and I'll be back- but this experience left a sour taste in my mouth.

Steak was overcooked and under seasoned. Fries were soggy and aioli was dull. Spaghetti arrabbiata was a bad joke. Lobster ravioli had a weird undercooked texture and practically no flavor besides being blandly creamy. PROS: Service was good.

In addition to being conveniently located, the menu for restaurant week looked pretty interesting.  Though the menu received at the restaurant was not quite the same as the one found online, in the end, I'm so happy we went!We both started with a cocktail.  I had the Floozie.  I'm not a big fan of gin, but I thought the rest of the ingredients sounded really good and decided to take a chance. Good thing I did.  The drink was great; it was exactly what I was hoping for.  It was crisp/light and somewhat fruity, and the gin was not at all overpowering.  For dinner, I had the warm arugula salad (with walnuts, pears and shaved parmesan), followed by the spaghetti with roasted veal meatballs.  To be quiet honest, the salad was a little disappointing.  The ingredients were nice and fresh.  However, both my gf and I agreed that it lacked a little acidity.  The dressing seemed to be mostly olive oil, which took away from each item, individually (at least for us).  However, this was in no way a disappointment.  Where the salad might've lacked, the entrée more than made up for.  My spaghetti was cooked perfectly.  The veal meatballs were tender, moist and well-seasoned, and the sauce was extremely flavorful.  Even the bread and the tapenade were delicious.For dessert, I opted for the hazelnut gelato with shortbread cookie.  I was a little hesitant when the waiter informed me that they'd run out of the hazelnut gelato and asked if I'd like mascarpone gelato, instead.  However, dinner was so good, my hesitance didn't last long and I decided to go for it.  I know what you're thinking.  Cheese gelato?!  It was one of the first thoughts that came to my mind as well, but trust me when I say it was the most amazing thing I'd ever tasted!  The gelato tasted something like whipped cream and the cookie was slightly sweet, flaky, and practically melted on my tongue.  Phenomenal! To make the night even better, service was incredible. The hostess who seated us was quick and nice.  Our waiter, Tom, was the sweetest guy and responded to our table in record time.  The staff in general seemed to be extremely organized and worked very well as a team.  Whether by our waiter or one of the servers, food and drink items arrived at our table promptly and the moment something was done, someone was there to refresh or take them away...and were extremely pleasant while doing so.  I was also very impressed by the manager, Douglas, who kept a smile on his face as he walked around, helped out, and introduced himself.  I couldn't help but to stop him to say job well done.  All in all, the experience at this restaurant was one for the record books.  They've gained a customer for life.  I've yet to stop raving about them and am even planning to return in a couple of weeks when an old friend comes to town.",5.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,21.3999996185,"menu,restaurant,gf,dinner,drink,try,restaurant,restaurant,disappointment,Douglas,hazelnut gelato,one,same,addition,end,one,cocktail,table,thing,olive oil,gf,thoughts,Tom,Floozie,hesitance,rest,gin,arugula salad,dinner,chance,ingredients,gin,thing,salad,fan,walnuts,something,dinner,mascarpone gelato,Cheese gelato,salad,waiter,sauce,veal meatballs,spaghetti,item,spaghetti,shortbread cookie,dressing,someone,parmesan,pears,acidity,way,entrée,dessert,tapenade,mind,hostess,one,waiter,drink,items,servers,team,food,face,smile,restaurant,one,friend,experience,all,ingredients,veal meatballs,record books,customer,life,town,job,bread,gelato,cookie,service,something,staff,tongue,cream,general","7,2,7,4,7,7,2,2,4,1,7,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,6,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,4,6,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,1,7,6,7,3,7,7,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1","0.0867577567697,0.0623926855624,0.0557342395186,0.0526667647064,0.0312205180526,0.0299111418426,0.0287547912449,0.0286082457751,0.0274506751448,0.0231571868062,0.022619318217,0.0224492438138,0.0212524570525,0.0200546700507,0.0199522487819,0.0199522487819,0.0199522487819,0.0183737557381,0.0181123204529,0.0176600888371,0.014725420624,0.0129444915801,0.0120403142646,0.0117866424844,0.0116003733128,0.0108822584152,0.0102808410302,0.00945223961025,0.00945223961025,0.0088237831369,0.00866238679737,0.00866238679737,0.00864241085947,0.00761138927191,0.00757976900786,0.007523547858,0.00704555446282,0.00690466817468,0.00678272312507,0.00660075619817,0.00634178845212,0.00632282346487,0.00601717550308,0.00580582395196,0.00580582395196,0.00577883468941,0.00576364994049,0.00575505429879,0.00531907938421,0.00513270590454,0.00507978023961,0.00507978023961,0.00506129302084,0.00505141494796,0.00504700001329,0.00503535149619,0.00503535149619,0.00459356512874,0.00457294145599,0.00429816450924,0.00429816450924,0.00390935130417,0.00390935130417,0.00390935130417,0.00342174479738,0.00342027447186,0.00341885280795,0.00341885280795,0.00339730852284,0.00316678057425,0.00316354306415,0.0028244680725,0.00270329625346,0.00250837765634,0.00249456847087,0.00236501614563,0.00236412091181,0.00236412091181,0.00236325198784,0.00222057267092,0.00218081241474,0.00216088630259,0.00205342983827,0.00205134623684,0.00189045036677,0.00157864380162,0.00150415219832,0.00150415219832,0.00150054588448"

Extra bonus, really liked the design of the bathrooms and they were clean. Which is much appreciated. Second time four of us came during the restaurant crawl. One of the appetizers we didn't like and they removed it from our tabs no questions asked. It wasn't a regular menu item so most likely experimental.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,5898,"Delicious food, bottomless mimosas, beautiful crowd, airy space. What not to love?Well... the service was downright rude. First off, they nearly gave our table away.  My boyfriend and I were ten minutes late, while the other half of our party was there. This is while my friend overheard the manager, I presume, tell a party-of-five-or-so that just walked in: ""ooh I'm sooo sorry! ... maybe ten minutes.""  In other words, in a few minutes, perhaps this group would be seated at ""our"" table.  So while our table was about to be given away because we weren't right on time, ""our"" table wasn't even ready for us, let along anybody.  Strange.  In the end, we arrived in the nick of time at about 12:43 for our 12:30 reservation and proceeded to wait another five minutes for a ""our"" table.  I'm calling the table ""ours"" because supposedly when they do reservations, they reserve specific tables. Once seated, we ordered drinks, entrees  and eventually dessert. Everything came out really fast which is usually a plus, but when you're double dating you want to catch up and enjoy a more leisurely brunch.  Even though we had the bottomless mimosas, we basically had to ask for refills. Our water glasses were empty as well, and no one asked how the food was either.  It was kinda like, they're food was so good, their deal so great, that they didn't feel the need to have any kind of service at all.Now the lack of service wouldn't have been so terrible because the food was good-- I had the baked eggs, yum!-- and the place is cute.  But then the manger, I presume, told us there was a 3 o'clock reservation for our specific table.  Yup, our round table in the corner by the window.  She added that she'd be more than happy to find us a place at the bar.  In other words, we were being kicked out. Honestly, I've never been so rushed in my life  My experience on Sunday was a serious disappointment considering my first time at Lido just a few months ago was a lot better.  My brother and I had a reservation around 2 or 3 pm on a Saturday or Sunday.  We had the mimosas, entrees, but no dessert.  We had a lot of mimosas and just for a long while just catching up.  The staff was very courteous then.  I guess a table of four is more of a commodity.  My thing is if you're going to do bottomless mimosas, or brunch for that matter, people will linger. This is not fast food. No matter the quality of the food, I do expect service at a sit-down restaurant. I won't be back.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,28648,"I ventured out to Lido about a year or so ago when it first opened for brunch. During that meal I remember that the restaurant was empty but the food was some of the best I've had in my neighborhood. I was puzzled why people were beating down the door. However, when I returned to Lido a year later for brunch, it's clear that the word has spread. The restaurant was packed and there was a great buzz in the atmosphere as waiters and waitresses scurried around from table to table and the bartenders mixed mimosas and Bloody Marys.The brunch menu at Lido is nothing out of the ordinary - omelets, granola, French toast, sandwiches, etc. However, the food is prepared with care and all of the dishes have a tremendous amount of flavor. Between the three of us that were at brunch, we ordered the following:    White Polenta: mushroom, ragu, parmigiano reggiano, poached eggs    Omelet with Mushroom: guanciale, caramelized onion, goat cheese    Baked French Toast: berries and cream, Vermont maple syrup    Side of Bacon    Grilled Bread: butter, house made jamI had the white polenta all to myself and I was glad I wasn't sharing. It was delicious. Overall, there was a lot of flavor packed into this small skillet. The polenta was topped with mushrooms in a sweet sauce which was then topped with two poached eggs and a perfectly seasoned grilled piece of bread. The yolks of the poached eggs ran into the other components of the dish and after shoveling down as much as possible with my fork, the bread was a perfect way to soak up and enjoy the remaining sauce.While I didn't have any of the omelet or baked French toast, I will say that judging by my friend's expressions and the clean plates in front of them, these dishes were also equally enjoyed.The one complaint I do have is about the side of bacon. I like my bacon extra crispy and unfortunately, Lido doesn't seem to endorse this. The bacon that we received was not crispy and dripping in fat. I mean, I understand that I'm not eating the healthiest food item in the world, but at least limiting the amount of fat I see dripping off of my food would be a nice consideration next time around.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,7.19999980927,"Lido,brunch,people,food,restaurant,bread,some,meal,best,neighborhood,sauce,door,brunch,bacon,mimosas,buzz,plates,table,table,waitresses,waiters,word,bartenders,atmosphere,food,brunch,restaurant,toast,ordinary - omelets,dishes,Mushroom,eggs,Toast,mushroom,White Polenta,Bread,polenta,nothing,flavor,amount,eggs,mushrooms,polenta,Side,three,all,lot,French,berries,flavor,sandwiches,granola,brunch menu,care,goat cheese,house,ragu,butter,parmigiano reggiano,maple syrup,guanciale,cream,onion,complaint,bacon,bacon,skillet,piece,Bloody Marys.,dishes,side,Omelet,crispy,expressions,friend,front,Bacon Grilled,food,jamI,Vermont,yolks,consideration,fat,amount,fat,world,food item,toast,omelet,dish,eggs,components,any,fork","2,4,1,7,2,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,3,7,7,7,6,7,1,7,2,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.110507436097,0.0703506618738,0.0448552817106,0.040173266083,0.0339899584651,0.0320406928658,0.0265694856644,0.0249452423304,0.0249452423304,0.0249452423304,0.0168074946851,0.0167770422995,0.0127885062248,0.012568202801,0.0115503929555,0.0112616829574,0.010982517153,0.0107793975621,0.0107793975621,0.0107793975621,0.0107793975621,0.00945926830173,0.00943257845938,0.00943257845938,0.00859329290688,0.00857653282583,0.00826253090054,0.00800294335932,0.00800294335932,0.00798448361456,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00796890817583,0.00790002942085,0.0072626969777,0.0072626969777,0.00725983688608,0.00725983688608,0.00725983688608,0.00724852783605,0.00700151687488,0.00699184741825,0.00690841302276,0.00685170805082,0.00667196745053,0.00661228178069,0.00636934069917,0.00636934069917,0.00636934069917,0.00635464349762,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.0063422434032,0.00603567995131,0.00583129283041,0.00582486670464,0.00578544428572,0.00577772501856,0.00558639131486,0.00541792577133,0.00492789689451,0.0047189113684,0.00441731419414,0.00431148149073,0.00431148149073,0.00431148149073,0.0042920447886,0.00402530888095,0.00400084163994,0.00375509937294,0.00375027116388,0.00364520843141,0.00340468483046,0.0034014871344,0.0034014871344,0.00297587853856,0.00290135550313,0.00237645185553,0.00237645185553,0.00237645185553,0.00237645185553,0.00216137897223,0.00189087248873,0.00189087248873"

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,18866,"So, I have to preface this review by saying that I absolutely love Lido. Love the food, love the atmosphere. However, I'm not in love with one of the members of the staff. The past few times that I've been here, she has asked multiple guests to quiet down, blaming it on interfering with other guests. I'm guessing that she's southern because she does it with a smile and the slightest hint of condescension. Like, ""bless your heart."" (Kidding, I love southerners.) I've been to Lido around 10 times in the past year. It's a great place to swing by after work, grab a few delicious appetizers, and drink at the bar. Honestly, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in the City. Especially because of the Burrata and Poached Eggs. Mmmmm... Everything, everything is delicious.On to my story: I went to Lido with a party of 8 for brunch on a Sunday. A few of my friends were incredibly late, but they seated us anyway (a rarity!). We ordered the bottomless mimosas, some apps, and got to hanging. About 45 minutes into our reservation, the rest of the guests arrived. The staff was incredibly understanding; I mean, who doesn't understand weekend MTA schedules?!As more and more people filtered into the restaurant, my favorite member of the staff seemed to lose her mind. She went from table to table, telling (not asking) people to quiet down. ""You're being too loud for the other guests."" Really? Really? Everyone was talking at a pretty loud level. I hate to say it, but the next time I walk in to Lido and see her standing in the restaurant, I'll turn around and walk out. She's not worth the food.But, if you're OK with eating in a study hall while she's there, make sure you go and order the farmstead cheeses as dessert!",4.0 star rating,"Seattle, WA",2,1,0.20000000298,11.1000003815,"Lido,guests,review,staff,food,one,members,place,atmosphere,love,guests,member,Everything,everything,smile,hint,condescension,heart,staff,restaurants,one,few,guests,rest,Everyone,southerners,Kidding,bar,appetizers,work,City,story,brunch,party,friends,rarity,mimosas,apps,reservation,level,restaurant,Poached Eggs,Burrata,people,dessert,farmstead cheeses,study hall,restaurant,staff,people,table,table,mind,schedules,MTA","2,1,5,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,7,2,7,4,3,1,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,2,2,1,1,7,7,7,7,3","0.142618745565,0.131610810757,0.0729103237391,0.0435820668936,0.0414065085351,0.0396708808839,0.0396708808839,0.0375955104828,0.0362641066313,0.0347423441708,0.0195793174207,0.0180382169783,0.0135730858892,0.0135730858892,0.0132228694856,0.0132228694856,0.0132228694856,0.0131924040616,0.0120711755008,0.011969617568,0.0114827062935,0.0113309146836,0.0108898002654,0.0108898002654,0.0108732460067,0.00923757441342,0.00889322254807,0.00886496435851,0.00886496435851,0.00886496435851,0.00885314401239,0.00882377754897,0.00882377754897,0.00882377754897,0.00806760042906,0.00806760042906,0.00806055311114,0.00806055311114,0.00805396679789,0.00599387520924,0.00561014283448,0.00523662101477,0.00523662101477,0.00487782759592,0.00414568046108,0.00414568046108,0.00414568046108,0.00356821343303,0.00331515213475,0.00301518244669,0.00301299779676,0.00301299779676,0.00291953724809,0.00263788178563,0.00156130327377"

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,81747,"Writing a yelp review since I was unable to confirm if an email I attempted to send the restaurant via their website actually went through.  Yesterday morning I dined at Lido and while my meal and service at the bar were just fine, the behavior of two other staff members during my meal was utterly appalling, racially insensitive, disrespectful, and just plain WRONG.  On at least 3 occasions, I witnessed a white male server and a hispanic male server joking about the current police shootings of unarmed black men.  In between serving tables, whenever the two would pass each other, the white staff member would raise his hands and say ""WHITE POWER"", followed by the hispanic guy holding his hands up and saying ""HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT"".  Laughter ensued between the two after this.  It was funny to them.  To make matters worse, this occurred in a restaurant literally days after the world watched two unarmed black men murdered in cold blood on video all within 24 hours of each other.  These staff members think what is going on in this country is so comedic, that they felt comfortable displaying this behavior in public, at their place of employment, in full view and earshot of patrons such as myself.  As a black woman, and a resident of Harlem (a historically black neighborhood, which is changing due to gentrification, yet still very rich in black culture) for many years, I am extremely offended and still disturbed a day later that this happened in Harlem! When you work for any establishment whether it be the service industry or not, there is a certain level of decorum you exhibit and a code of conduct you follow because ultimately, you represent your employer.  I respect the views and opinions of any and everyone, if you think Black Lives Matter and the phrase ""hands up don't shoot"" is comedic, that's on you. But when you throw this in my face at a restaurant, a restaurant I'm spending my money which ultimately pays your wages, that's where we have a problem.  These men openly did this behavior at least 3 times.  Even after I made eye contact with one of them that nonverbally conveyed ""hey, I see you"".  I left Lido quite shaken up about what I had just witnessed.  On the way out, I recounted what I'd seen to the manager and while she seemed just as shocked as me, she simply said she would deal with it.  I'm not sure exactly what that means but I certainly hope it wasn't just a conversation had. We live in a day and age where more and more people are being held accountable for the insensitive or inappropriate language they use either verbally or via social media. Unless it's representative of the values of this company/establishment, employees behaving like this is unfortunately reflective of the company as a whole.  If these men are still employed with Lido after what they did yesterday, that let's me know where Lido stands on these issues and it sends the message that what they did was no big deal.  Obviously I'll never dine at Lido again.  I have already alerted other friends of mine in the neighborhood, both black and white, to follow suit and plan to cast a wider net in the event these men are still serving tables.  Any place where a white man feels comfortable saying ""white power""  is no place for black people to patronize and spend their hard earned money.  Doesn't matter if it's a joke or not.  It's not funny!  EVER. White power is hate speech.  Period.  Unless you like your entree with a side of racial insensitivity, please dine at one of the many other options available along Frederick Douglas Blvd.",1.0 star rating,"New York, NY",4,0,-0.300000011921,12.8999996185,"hate speech,Lido,yelp review,restaurant,service industry,email,website,staff member,restaurant,behavior,staff members,service,server,server,staff members,meal,men,Harlem,bar,occasions,guy,DON'T SHOOT,hands,one,men,each other,joke,men,two,two,restaurant,meal,hands,tables,police shootings,Laughter,matters,manager,place,world,representative,each other,people,men,employment,place,behavior,level,view,behavior,views,men,people,money,employer,cold blood,video,earshot,country,public,patrons,culture,gentrification,resident,woman,conduct,decorum,code,opinions,everyone,phrase,wages,problem,face,eye contact,way,deal,company,neighborhood,age,place,whole,let,issues,message,friends,net,plan,mine,Black Lives Matter,suit,tables,money,one,entree,event,man,options,side,insensitivity,employees,company,establishment,conversation,social media,language,values,Frederick Douglas Blvd","7,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,2,7,1,7,7,7,1,4,1,2,2,4,1,5,7,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,2,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,7,2,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,5,7,2,1,1,7,7,1,1,7,7,5,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,1,3,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.143904387951,0.0553162842989,0.044756360352,0.0409003607929,0.0400802120566,0.0389820970595,0.0303104668856,0.024293012917,0.0219246000051,0.0216547064483,0.0210760440677,0.0195255931467,0.0194258764386,0.0194258764386,0.0181460324675,0.0165097229183,0.0156878307462,0.0145271411166,0.0144499940798,0.0143761057407,0.0139318779111,0.0123210279271,0.00980274751782,0.00968837086111,0.00955556612462,0.00880736205727,0.00832542218268,0.00788739789277,0.00740078790113,0.00737990112975,0.00734851695597,0.00716209597886,0.00687642395496,0.00657989084721,0.00627759983763,0.0062733925879,0.00621057208627,0.00548826390877,0.00547809107229,0.00543401110917,0.00529217068106,0.00526882428676,0.00498268846422,0.004783869721,0.00460208766162,0.00460208766162,0.00460208766162,0.00453003868461,0.00418582232669,0.00418551592156,0.00416895980015,0.00403015408665,0.0039284741506,0.00381075940095,0.00379446870647,0.00366840744391,0.00366840744391,0.00366220274009,0.00366220274009,0.00366220274009,0.00366220274009,0.00365673843771,0.00365673843771,0.00365673843771,0.00365673843771,0.0036518573761,0.0036518573761,0.0036518573761,0.00364744733088,0.00364744733088,0.00364744733088,0.00333401886746,0.00333401886746,0.00333401886746,0.0033275091555,0.00332188070752,0.00295526930131,0.00283033284359,0.00282507645898,0.002770582214,0.00266619725153,0.00247617205605,0.00247456179932,0.00247456179932,0.00247456179932,0.00247157271951,0.00247157271951,0.00247157271951,0.00247157271951,0.00246796268038,0.00244042812847,0.00205751997419,0.00195464165881,0.00194890366402,0.00174879364204,0.00171097437851,0.00171000999399,0.00170498981606,0.00170498981606,0.00170498981606,0.00167168478947,0.00124110851903,0.00124110851903,0.00115848507266,0.00108649930917,0.00108649930917,0.00108575436752,0.00100907683372"

I'm happy to say it did not disappoint! I made a reservation at 2 PM today for 5 people and when we arrived a few minutes early they already had the table set up for us. Four out of the five of us opted to go with the bottomless mimosa option for $14 each & I was impressed with how adamant they were about keeping our glasses filled. (Even after we had paid the bill and were sitting there for a few minutes our waitress came over and asked if anyone wanted more!) Also all of the food was delicious. I got the French toast which was amazing and also tried some of the bacon and fried potatoes, all of which I found to be very tasty. The spaghetti and veal meatballs were also quite good - there is a little something extra in the sauce that makes it slightly spicy which I really enjoyed.

But after being an advocate and very frequent Lido visitor  (multiple times a week, knew all the staff by name), I decided to take my dollars elsewhere. This Saturday I eagerly encouraged my friend to celebrate her birthday at Lido. As soon as we sat down, I requested, as I have so many times before, the substitution of orange juice for another juice in the mimosa due to an allergy.  Without battering an eye the waiter vehemently shook his head no. I then asked to speak to the manager who after several excuses walked away to consider our suggestion to let us mix the juice and champagne ourselves so I could forgo the orange juice since she wouldn't agree to presenting the mimosa with another juice.  She returns to tell us this is a reoccurring problem, she contacted the owner and the owner would not allow any accommodations. As we continued to talk about it, I inform her I know the owner, she has been in the restaurant during other times I've requested this and she has agreed to this alteration with little to no push back. She then says she will bring up this issue with the owner. Wait... I thought you spoke with the owner about this specific instance and she said no to this particular request. With this finding of untruthfulness, we decided to take our financial support to Blujeen, a block away. The food was absolutely fantastic, the unlimited drinks were amazing and it all came at a better price. As someone who patronized Lido from its inception, I would advise that it's much harder to get a new customer than to keep an old one.

Never spoke to me or apologized.  My friend who frequents Lido also agreed that it was very awkward.  I guess she's playing favorites at Lido.  I do hope she changes her attitude.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,501,"Bored of the usual Sunday morning breakfast / brunch haunts of mine (read: Upper West Side diners and the same ol' lovely but tried bakeries), I wanted to head in a new direction, literally. I've heard of many new restaurants popping up in the southern part of Harlem, so I let my Yelp app do the searching, and lo and behold, we were soon led to Lido.It's a simple hop off of the B / C at 116th, awfully convenient to get to. The interior is large, the crowd, varied, with a white breezy ambiance and small chandeliers twinkling above. Seated in the rear, the squeeze was a trifle tight in our winter coats, but doable. The food was the kind that made us stop mid-chew as the flavors and textures hit us in a tremendous wallop. I got the gnocchi with truffle butter, parmesan, guanciale, and sage. The cream sauce it's served in is almost criminally good. They should make you sign a waiver absolving them from wrong doing if you get a heart attack after consumption. You can really taste heavy cream notes with a perfect hint of truffle oil. If I had a spoon, I would have eaten it like soup afterwards.The guanciale was good for the most part, with a few chewy pieces here and there. The gnocchi itself was perfectly cooked and toothsome.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,95691,"UPDATE: After posting my original review below I received a very heartfelt apology from the waiter who served us that day. He didn't express any resentment over my review or make any excuses about the brunch service that day. I think it showed a lot of character and I was very appreciative to hear from him. I've decided to leave my review as it was originally written (this was our honest experience), but we will definitely be back and I will update again with the results.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I haven't reviewed anything in a long time, but unfortunately my poor experience at Lido has coaxed me out of ""retirement"". Sometimes you have an instance where the food is bad, or the service has slipped, or any number of other things, but today it was all of the above. Some of these things may be nitpicking but it all added up to a really disappointing experience.We came for brunch at 1:00 pm, the place was lively but not packed, there was no wait, etc. We were seated right away and offered drinks. We just requested water, which was served lukewarm without any ice on an 89 degree day. It was then 20 minutes before anybody came back to take our food order.Another 20 minutes later our waiter came back and very apologetically informed us that the kitchen had lost our ticket, so they were just starting on our food now and it would be a while longer. Ok, not a big deal we said with a smile, these things happen and we did appreciate him at least informing us. Shortly after, we received our Beet Salad which was very good. It tasted fresh and the goat cheese and basil ""fritter"" was hot out of the fryer. However we found the portion to be small, even by finer dining standards, especially for a $14 salad without any particularly exotic ingredients. This should have maybe been $9.Afterward we had to wait again - this time another 20 minutes for our entrees. My girlfriend's Poached Eggs with Broccoli Rabe and Veal Meatballs were competently prepared but lacking in seasoning. It also lacked any sort of bread or starch (or even maybe some grits or polenta) with which to soak up the copious amounts of tomato sauce and egg yolk. I see that Lido offers a side of grilled bread for $4 - I'm sure it's fine and comes with some accouterments that make it worth paying for, but to me that's not a replacement for a standard gratis bread service.My Short Rib Hash fared less well - pretty much everything in the dish was poor and it was clear that the plate had been sitting for at least 10 minutes. I think of a hash as being golden brown, with crusty potatoes, caramelized onions or peppers, and flavorful meat. The potatoes and peppers were almost non-existent (it was really just a pile of meat with a few dots of vegetables), and unseasoned with no browning or color on them at all. Almost as if they were just plainly boiled and added in. The meat was ok, but it was so liquidy that it completely soaked the English muffins underneath, which were already a mushy paste when they arrived. The poached eggs were overcooked, without any liquid yolk at all, and the little bit of Hollandaise (only about a tablespoon's worth) was solidified, with a thick film on it.You might think that the server, who had earlier apologized about the wait (without us complaining, for the record) would maybe follow up and check on us, but nobody stopped by at all for the rest of the meal. This is especially frustrating to me as a former waiter myself. The real shame is this - there are some businesses where you want to write a bad review. Your experience was so bad and you hated the place so much that you just want to rip into it. I don't feel that way about Lido - somewhere in there I think there is a really good neighborhood restaurant. Looking at the menus and reviews, I really wanted this place to be great. But it just wasn't. I will give them another shot at dinner service and hopefully things will be different.",2.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",4,0,-0.20000000298,17.8999996185,"waiter,review,review,character,instance,apology,UPDATE,things,Some,review,REVIEW,brunch service,experience,Lido,meat,resentment,kitchen,Beet Salad,excuses,lot,things,wait,service,service.My Short Rib Hash,grits,accouterments,food,place,experience,shame,muffins,brunch,waiter,retirement,number,above,food,water,anything,portion,goat cheese,food order.,girlfriend,bread,bread,salad,businesses,anybody,review,egg yolk,drinks,ice,ticket,smile,deal,fryer,basil,fritter,ingredients,dining standards,entrees,seasoning,bit,wait,waiter,starch,sort,polenta,amounts,tomato sauce,everything,dish,replacement,side,Veal Meatballs,things,rest,yolk,experience,place,reviews,paste,meal,nobody,record,film,worth,tablespoon,dinner service,neighborhood restaurant,Broccoli Rabe,place,server,potatoes,somewhere,Eggs,way,menus,Hollandaise,plate,hash,brown,peppers,browning,peppers,eggs,shot,pile,onions,color,vegetables,dots,English","1,5,5,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,5,7,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,3,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,1,7,5,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.158106312156,0.141970410943,0.0428405590355,0.034225333482,0.0309823155403,0.0291659981012,0.0284403245896,0.0233567673713,0.0220555737615,0.0204577073455,0.0202794708312,0.0194482374936,0.0193420667201,0.0157897956669,0.0156386494637,0.0151890963316,0.0139556787908,0.0121956663206,0.0105251232162,0.0100811189041,0.00895237363875,0.00875633209944,0.00834312662482,0.00801634695381,0.00793891120702,0.00793281849474,0.00787678733468,0.0076620709151,0.00694192852825,0.00620883377269,0.0061749862507,0.00583679974079,0.00545190973207,0.00513322930783,0.00511873373762,0.00511873373762,0.00431014224887,0.00430475268513,0.00424449238926,0.00418155035004,0.0040810117498,0.00399338500574,0.00396760972217,0.00391551107168,0.00391250289977,0.00390202878043,0.00383582548238,0.00379594205879,0.0035895917099,0.00356129463762,0.00344078056514,0.00343496049754,0.00342983496375,0.00342525658198,0.00342525658198,0.00341734825633,0.00341734825633,0.00341734825633,0.00341388210654,0.00341388210654,0.00341067602858,0.00340769416653,0.00339118763804,0.00333000253886,0.00332812638953,0.00311574083753,0.00311574083753,0.00311574083753,0.00311574083753,0.00311574083753,0.00311334687285,0.00311334687285,0.00311334687285,0.00311334687285,0.00272864825092,0.00264992262237,0.00264974730089,0.00264974730089,0.00258842902258,0.0024641957134,0.00241929874755,0.00231953943148,0.00231817131862,0.00231817131862,0.00231817131862,0.00231817131862,0.00231817131862,0.00231817131862,0.00229732436128,0.00224227178842,0.00201715319417,0.00201361323707,0.00193034030963,0.00170785782393,0.00169633189216,0.00168667838443,0.00160136655904,0.00160060019698,0.00137206783984,0.00134805950802,0.00116485590115,0.00116485590115,0.00116485590115,0.00116405729204,0.00116405729204,0.00114724854939,0.00113540049642,0.00108503014781,0.00101904443,0.00101834570523,0.00101834570523,0.00101834570523,0.000601888867095"

What I call ""classy"" portions, which is to say, not huge, but enough to fill you up. I had the scallops and risotto, which was perfectly fine, but not the best I've ever had. I wasn't a huge fan of the risotto (topped with watercress, I think, which I wasn't a fan of, and otherwise the flavor was uninspired), but the scallops were nice - five well-seared, medium size scallops, which is actually more generous than a lot of places. We started with the polenta fries, which were alright, but again nothing special, and I had their specialty gin cocktail, which was heavy on the limoncello. The ambiance at dinner is a little weird - they have a screen showing a football game on over the bar, but otherwise it's not really that kind of a place, so it threw me off a bit.On the bright side, we were running late for our dinner reservation (8pm on a Saturday) and they pushed it back a bit for us with no problem.

Now, onto the food.  We ordered the cod fish fritters which were absolutely delicious.  They were perfectly seasoned.  i honestly probably could have eaten about 50.  There is nothing i hate more in a restaurant than having to pick up a salt shaker due to lack of seasoning, and this place definitely didn't have me grabbing the salt or pepper shaker. We also ordered the Parmesan  polenta fries, very good too.  For my entree i got the salmon with celery root mashed and crispy parsnip ribbons, everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly like our appetizers, i also really appreciated the fact that my salmon was cooked medium like i asked.  My husband ordered the organic crispy chicken with the arugula and garlic mashed potatoes.  its was phenomenal, literally probably the best mashed potatoes i have ever had.  My only complaint would be that the chicken was kind of a small portion.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate pudding with sea salt and EVOO, it was decadent and rich, and the salt gave it just the saltiness the pudding needed to balance it out.

Luckily we waited and within 15 mins we were seated at a table; albeit in a pretty tight area but ill take it. The brunch menu had great options and had me feeling confused on what to pick. In the end, i decided on the white polenta with the poached eggs, a side of bacon, and a mimosa. My initial waiter seemed to be to busy to come take our order but another waiter saw me breaking my neck trying to get his attention and came to my rescue...I called him my savior as I was pretty hungry lol He truly was because we got impeccable service from there on out. And my food,....Gosh that was such a great meal! My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it now. Lido is not only is a beautiful place but rustic in decor and has great fast, service.

The service was also impeccable even though it was so crowded. Our waiter was extremely attentive throughout our meal, kept coming by with refills for our mimosas and water, and was really friendly. We definitely got a great deal with the mimosas because he topped up our glasses so frequently our glasses never went empty! Very impressive service!As for the food, a few of my friends got the Polenta ($15) which looked and smelt amazing and tasted delish! I really regretted not getting that too because I was underwhelmed by the dish I ordered (Tuscan Pizza Tart, $13), which was pretty much just a small pita-pizza that you could easily make at home. To give them some credit, the dish was meant to be an appetizer and the waiter had actually advised me to order something else. I was just too stubborn and just HAD to satisfy my pizza craving right there and then.. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Lido for a great boozy brunch experience.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,113563,"Wow.Let's first talk about the neighborhood, this area is THE definition of gentrification. I am baffled at how awesome this area has become. With that said, Lido has to be one of the additions that defines this neighborhood. Classy, simple, great food, great crowd, great atmosphere all in the heart of Harlem. Let's discuss the food shall we? I started off with a kale salad which I thought sounded boring and when I first saw looked truly boring and small but don't let this fool you, this is a delicious action-packed tiny kale salad that you should try. Simple, filled with flavor and a great way to open up your appetite. Next, my boyfriend ordered the veal meatballs which I tried despite being a vegetarian and I have to say are delicious as ever. I've always said that no one tops Uva's veal meatballs but his place gives them some competition. They are served in a little pot and smothered in a delicious red sauce. All you need is some bread and you're set my friend. For my main course, I ordered the red snapper which was cooked perfectly and served over a bed of califlower, raisins, pine nuts and olives. To be quite honest I could have the bedding alone and be satisfied with my entire meal. Perhaps next time I'll do that. Hm. The olives are a bit too strong flavored though as I normally like green olives but it doesn't really matter this bedding is delicious as ever. A must try! Finally, my boyfriend ordered the mussels which were served with a curry like sauce and WA out of this world. I love mussles but am turned away at times because of the graininess it bring. These however, were clean as can be and prepared in a delicious sauce. Lido is a wonderful new addition to the area.

Between the four of us dining we had many plates - starters, salads, pasta, poultry, etc., and every dish was as good as the next. I personally shared two salads to start - the Warm Arugula Salad and the Nectarine and Heirloom Tomato. Both were great, but the Nectarine and Heirloom tomato was simply delicious - what a great combination of bright and fresh flavors.For my main course I enjoyed the Gnocchi, and it was everything I wanted it to be without being too heavy to finish it off.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,198748,"""Methinks not"". Too right. What a shame. Came in for a late lunch on a random Monday and seeing as though it was less then half full I automatically assumed service and food would be fine. Granted, I was less than wowed the last time I came but I owed the host's rude behavior to a full house. I should have listened to my gut but I didn't and here goes. Menu arrived and I ordered. Glass of wine and mussels. Yum, right? The wine was fine. Three mussels in, I bit into a morsel full of sand. Now, I've eaten mussels my entire life and I know that one, they can be tricky to clean and two, they're from the ocean (dur) so a bit of grit once in a while is not unusual. So I brushed it off, washed it down with a sip and kept going. Another fork-full of sand. Not again. Then another. Now, I'm upset but figure it can't be that the entire plate is full of mussels laden with sand. It can't be that a restaurant full of people happily munching could have not washed their seafood before cooking and serving. After a fourth attempt, I can't go any further. I call the waitress over, who by the way, has not checked on me once. I quietly tell her that the mussels are sandy. She apologizes, asks if there's anything else I'd like (to which I say I'll look at a menu) and takes the plate away. As she passes who I assume is the manager, I hear her repeat my complaint followed by ""I've never heard anyone say that about the mussels before."" Excuse me?! What does your memory of costumer critique have to do with my plate of inedible food? The bill comes (?) After another ten minutes she returns for the bill which is complete, sans menu.I hold my card up as she reaches for it and explain that I was very disappointed with the meal and that I'm not at all concerned with what she's heard from other costumers about the meal at which point she cuts me off, says she'll see what she can do, grabs the bill and walks off. Two minutes later, a new bill arrives, minus the cost of the mussels and she explains that because she can't take anything off the bill, the mussels are on her. Pity.Lessons learned 1) Trust your instinct. 2) Don't give average restaurants second chances. 3)Once terrible service, always terrible service 4) Lido doesn't particularly care about it's wait staff if it forces them absorb the cost for their subpar food.Sad.

Like that it's not pretentious (some drunch places are full of the worst people in New York), like the nice restaurant itself, and man do they keep the drinks flowing!Why it's not 5 stars: 1) Portions are way too small. Sure the food is good, but if everyone is starving at the end of the meal - not sure the quality is good enough to compensate for the quality. 2) The food is ok, I've had better for less. I had the White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs (whew!). I""m obsessed with polenta + eggs + ragu, but I've had it other places for less (Carroll Place!!!) I'd go for a sweet entree next time, the savory ones all looked a little lacking. 3) Too expensive! $15 on top of an entree cost of already $15 for unlimited drinks is too much. I'm not going to pay $30 for drunch if I'm only getting mimosas, at least through in some interesting sangrias (looking at you Calle Ocho). All in all, it was pretty good but not worth the price.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,20283,"Was staying at the nearby Aloft Harlem hotel and ordered in from Lido. Based on Yelp recommendations, I ordered the truffle gnocchi (pictured- and I had only eaten ONE gnocchi before I took it). I also got a side salad (pictured), which was just mixed greens some beans and lots of shaved parmesan-- huge portion for $5. It's also not on the menu, so just ask. The gnocchi was okay, and portion was small for the price. However, the dish was so heavy that a larger portion honestly would have been too much.

A very rude manager provided me with a Hurricane Sandy excuse (!) which did not make any sense as well as an excuse that they are too busy to accommodate a large table.

The dinner was a disappointment, as we were not able to all be together (after two months of planning). Also disappointing has been the fact that I was not offered a solution to fix the situation.

The restaurant itself is very charming and modern, and seems to be a hotspot for locals and even some Columbia kids. STAY ON YOUR SIDE OF MORNIN' SIDE PARK IF YA KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FER YA!Naw, Just playin.Erhm, ok. so, Greeted by nice host, and seated immediately. The place was loud, but there was this magical fairy with a literal pitcher of Mimosa just pouring it in peoples' cups without a care (i.e. the waitress.)I went for the bloody Mary, cuz I'm a lady. One of the best bloody mary's in the city, for sure! Served in a small whiskey sipper, plenty strong, was able to get four (4!!!) olives in my cup after much eye batting, of course.There is something though that many may night like, there is a rather thick pulpy sustance at the bottom. I keep trying to place what it is, but not sure. Maybe actual horseradish shavings? but very similar consistency. I enjoyed it.Service attentive, but not overbearing at all. Almost like the perfect balance. The best part was that we were NEVER asked if we wanted the bill.We were left to sit and chat, while my dining partner had his mimisa filled over and over (and over). But our waiter was always watching us, and as soon as we were ready i turned to him, and he dashed on over and fetched the bill.one of the first 30 percent tips I've left.Ugh, the food really is just delicous. Honestly, if you're a foodie just go.How about tender short rib hash, on top of a homeade crispy busicuit served under an absolutely perfectly cooked poached egg, to make a non traditional eggs benedict, with a side of fresh baby greens and the most perfect vinagrette.I won't go further, the choices are all as delicous.just go, it's really not crazy expensive either. maybe $30 or $40 a person including drinks.Listen, I get that it's not cheap, but if you were 30 blocks lower, you could double your tip, and cut your service in half.P.S.

The mussel dish was nice and hearty due to the cannellini beans that made for a nice stew. Kale salad was substantial, too. This wasn't a flimsy dish of loosely tossed kale leaves.

The attempt to provide both breakfast and lunch dishes, and get patrons in and out as quickly as possible often causes brunch to fall flat for me. The weekend brunch at Lido is the exception to this rule. The food is fresh, inspired, and flavorful. We ordered the French Toast, Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, Turkey Sausage, and Fried Potatoes. And of course, we had to try the crepe and plum gelati for dessert (as if French Toast with whipped cream and syrup isn't dessert enough). Obviously, I'm all about Sunday afternoon decadence!  Everything we tasted was amazing, but the sausage was a particular standout. It was almost the consistency of a crab cake with flavors of apple, lemon, and sage. Our server Chris was excellent. He was attentive, knowledgeable and fun! He took our orders right away, and checked in on us to see how our ""first bites"" were. Most importantly, regardless of how busy the restaurant got, he was always magically on hand to refill our champagne glasses. The mimosas were indeed bottomless!!The diverse and lively crowd at Lido is part of the experience; brunch is an excellent time for people watching. Furthermore, Lido is one of those rare places that is fabulous and kid friendly at the same time.

I had some pasta with lobster (can't remember the name of it) and he had spaghetti with shrimp and spicy red sauce. BOTH our meals were straight up TASTELESS. I had to put so much salt on my food and the service was very VERY subpar....Fast forward two weeks...GOODMy boyfriend and I got up early and came to brunch. Mimosa's were on point. I got a basic eggs bacon and potato meal which was very good. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and so were the eggs. our glasses were never empty as they came around quite often with the pitcher. The champagne to o.j. ratio was just right. The service was up to par. Overall after my first visit this place was going to get only two stars. I tacked on another two after my second visit for the great experience.

The food was great. I opted for the poached eggs over potatoes and spinach.  My bf ordered the poached eggs over the veal meatballs. Needless to say, i ordered the better meal. It was amazing. He enjoyed the meatballs, but I think the sauce was a bit watery.  It would have been better with a thicker consistency. The waiters are on it with the mimosa refills which is always nice. We ordered a side of bacon and garlic bread. The garlic bread was really delicious and cheesy, but heavy on the oily side.  The bacon came out extremely crispy and the waiter removed that from our bill with no complaint.  Overall, really good brunch spot in Harlem.  I would suggest coming on a Saturday as opposed to Sunday because it's not as busy.

Things got off to a rocky start when we had a reservation, were seated promptly, and then left alone for nearly ten minutes. You know that moment - when you say to yourself, ""Shit, we might be in trouble here."" The restaurant was HOT (because it was 92 degrees outside and they had a dining room completely full of guests). Once we finally raised a flag to say ""Help!"" the staff at Lido did more than one might imagine to make the experience amazing for us. Aside from the personable connection, service was prompt, follow up was determined, and they truly wowed us until we walked out the door. They covered our dessert - and that was all we'd LET them cover. They offered to comp our entire meal. They were totally genuine when they said ""we feel bad that we let you get started the way you did.""

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,39019,"Amazing places like this should NOT be so far up north, but maybe closer to where I live!! I had a small high school reunion and one of our friend who lived up near 115th recommended it. After some complaints about the hike up North, we finally agreed to meet at Lido since I saw such good ratings -- wow, incredibly impressed. Service(5): Very good! We kind of told our waiter that the sun was in our eyes and asked if we could switch tables. Even though there weren't an empty table, he quickly got an umbrella for our table and really took the time to make sure we were comfortable. White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs (4): Very unique the way they make it. I would probably come back and ordered it again just because i loved how they made the Polenta. It was also an interesting mixed of ingredients that came together really nicely. The dish wasn't as light as I thought it would be and was probably my least favorite of everything else I ordered (doesn't say much since everything was delicious)Sugar Snap Pea, Arugula, Mint, and Basil with torn Burrata (5): Salad! I normally hate salad and I couldn't stop eating this salad. It was really refreshing and just went really well with the rest of our dishes -- the pasta and polenta. The mint really lightened the salad and it was just fun to eat!Spaghetti, Roasted Veal Meatballs, San Marzano Tomato, Basil (5): I could not stop eating this dish. I wanted to be selfish and not share with my friends and just take it all for myself. I really enjoyed it. Although the meatballs weren't the best meatballs I've had, I really liked the flavors and how they cooked the pasta almost al dente.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,198780,"We were a party of 4 on a Friday at 7pm, they only seat you when the whole party is present, pretty standard. We all ordered a drink and 2 apps for the table, an entree each and 1 dessert to share because we were stuffed. We paid a little under $50 each including the 20% tip. Service  was pretty bad....the server kept forgetting about 1 person at the table...the drink and the entree. Ordering food also took forever, maybe it was his first day? Anyway, we weren't in a rush so it was fine. The people there were a nice mix, casual and afterwork crowd, some families and some on dates. Now onto the food: We ordered the Burrata, Currants Agrodolce, Roasted Holland, Peppers, Fresh Oregano crostini, with all of the ingredients you wouldn't expect for it to be as bland as it was...also it was tiny for $10 and not actually like crostini at all. The Parmesan polenta fries (5 per order) were better but the olive dip was a little strange. The entrees were salmon, mushroom lasagne, spaghetti and meatballs and the gnocchi in sage and Parmesan cream sauce. The entrees were definitely much much better. I personally ordered the gnocchi and it was really great with a ton of fresh chopped sage. It was super rich but delicious. The tomato sauce in the spaghetti dish was pretty decent but I can be pretty picky about tomato sauce. Fish was perfectly seared medium rare and lasagna was nice. For dessert we just all wanted a taste of something sweet so we went for the lemon cheesecake with strawberry sorbet, not bad but I don't think I'd order it again. The question I guess is would I go back? Yes, I can dismiss the poor service as an off day but if I do go back I would probably order a salad and the gnocchi.

The table next to us was seated 2x before we got out food.  We had to ask two different people for the check and had to wait a long for it.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,200393,"Debating between a three and a four because it's a nice restaurant with good food, but I left thinking I don't need to come back (except for brunch- that sounds pretty amazing).  Namely, you guys need to figure out the pricing structure. Food is actually very good and service is excellent as well as a nice space-- but over $100 for a pretty simple, quick meal for 2  is just too much, especially in this neighborhood. That means to come here has to be a special occasion and it's just not that type of place.  I want to spend half that and eat here all the time. We live down the street and came here for an early supper on a Saturday evening after running errands in the city- too lazy to cook. Our 1 1/2 year old daughter was with us so we were really 2.5 people, I guess.   I had the pesto and my husband had a pork tenderloin special. Our daughter had a plate of buttered noodles ($9- you guys need kid's portions or half plates or something. Come on- buttered noodles for $9?) It was all very tasty, but nothing incredible. Pork was good, but for close to $30 i'd like it to be outstanding. Pesto was also good, but was really just oil and large chunks of walnuts. Try chopping that stuff up and adding some more tastes!  I don't want to pay over $20 for a plate of noodles with some nuts on it.   My husband had a beer and then a glass of wine. He just asked for a white wine instead of looking at the menu. They brought one, but the one they brought was $15- why?  Like I said the food was good, the space is pretty and the service was very attentive and nice about our baby. We were happy until we got the bill and somehow couldn't shake the feel that it just wasn't worth it in the end.  Two and a half plates and two drinks, no appetizers or desserts and still clocked in over $100.... I think I'll just go to Bier International instead. Please rework your menu or do some specials. I know I sound like a total penny pincher, but I just want a decent bowl of pasta from time to time without having to work it in the budget.  Every time I think to go back, I tell myself for $20 more we can go out for a great lobster dinner or for about $90 less I can make some pretty amazing pesto at home.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.0,9.19999980927,"restaurant,food,guys,husband,brunch,Food,service,noodles,pricing structure,feel,Pork,tastes,occasion,space,meal,neighborhood,type,place,Pesto,daughter,half plates,plate,pesto,plate,daughter,noodles,wine,city,supper,street,pork tenderloin,kid,something,nothing,oil,half plates,chunks,walnuts,nuts,beer,glass,errands,portions,specials,stuff,menu,end,drinks,appetizers,desserts,penny pincher,budget,pasta,bowl,home,lobster dinner,pesto,food,people,space,service,Bier International,one,wine,menu,baby,bill","2,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,6,1,7,6,2,7,2,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,1,2,7,3,7,6,7,1,7","0.250017791986,0.0675405189395,0.065053358674,0.0591753907502,0.0539202801883,0.0393693819642,0.0358366034925,0.0277017522603,0.0257865916938,0.0233087055385,0.0232070833445,0.0124146761373,0.0119794001803,0.0112208509818,0.00981936696917,0.00981936696917,0.00978367496282,0.00978367496282,0.00977417081594,0.00895201228559,0.00884276255965,0.00884276255965,0.00822871271521,0.00804756302387,0.00796244759113,0.00747746601701,0.00679562520236,0.00657329987735,0.00657329987735,0.00657329987735,0.00654938770458,0.00653962278739,0.00653962278739,0.00653090002015,0.00635281438008,0.00598653592169,0.00596286216751,0.00596286216751,0.00595122762024,0.00594602758065,0.00594602758065,0.00557509390637,0.00554652372375,0.00548405805603,0.00538258301094,0.00505313556641,0.00442936783656,0.00442648911849,0.00442648911849,0.00442648911849,0.00441865436733,0.00305932667106,0.00305932667106,0.00305932667106,0.00305767636746,0.00305767636746,0.00298193725757,0.00291789253242,0.00284203677438,0.00272203120403,0.00265386607498,0.00261887279339,0.00232345890254,0.00222548167221,0.00222548167221,0.00194406427909,0.00143288075924"

The dim lighting and soft music provided for a great date night ambiance, as do both the outside seating and indoor booth seating.I wasn't a fan of the sauce that accompanied the bread, but that may just be that I'm not big on olives, which the sauce tasted strongly of.I got the Pan-Seared Scallops with Beet Risotto. I was disappointed with the risotto as it was overwhelmingly beet flavored with little other flavors to balance the palate. The scallops provided some of the necessary balance and were amazingly cooked; however, there were only 4 pieces. My boyfriend's Spaghetti with Veal Meatballs was average.

There were so many different things I wanted to try, but I eventually opted for warm arugula salad. I loved everything about it, from the roasted pears to the toasted walnuts and white balsamic vinaigrette. Would definitely recommend adding your choice of protein if you want the salad to be a bit more filling. My friend tried the spaghetti with meatballs and enjoyed it as well.

After two great experiences, I found myself last night at Lido, ready for yet another great experience. I loved the decor of this place, it was very modern and trendy. The service was very attentive and I couldn't believe for a Tuesday night how busy it was. That must mean the place is good right? Well I have to say that Lido came up short on the food. We ordered one of everything off the menu which consisted of the mussels, and roasted beet salad. Both just a norm app in my book and they were good. For our entrees we had: Orecchiette, Sweet Italian Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Cherry Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I think my favorite part about this dish was the Brocoli Rabe, it had to of been drench in garlic which is why I loved it. The pasta was just pasta, really nothing out of this world. We also had the: Branzino, Roasted Red Pepper Livornese, Charred Onion, Organic Watercress, Fennel. I enjoyed this dish. I can't say I loved it. For dessert we had the tiramisu, which was just your standard tiramisu, nothing out of this world.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,42190,"It is a few years later but Lido is still kicking it up in Harlem with the same great brunch menu and local crowd. That is pretty impressive to me because Harlem is gentrifying like mad and a lot of new businesses (even Whole Foods) are entering the market. I think the reason Lido remains so successful is because they consistently deliver on food and experience, and are a fixture of the neighborhood.The ambiance is chic yet warm - somehow the décor manages to be very stylish yet casual and approachable. Even though the restaurant is narrow and generally quite busy it avoids feeling claustrophobic, the exception perhaps being when a line of bottomless Mimosa-laden folks forms for the restroom.The staff here are always on point and don't have too much turnover. The place is exceptionally busy on the weekend. Everyone seems on top of things yet still manage to be fun and friendly. They have the right amount of urgency to provide good service without also looking pained or stressed.My favorite brunch dish to order is the 'White Polenta, Truffle Oil, Mushroom Ragu, Parmigiano Reggiano, Poached Eggs.' For the carnivores amongst my friends recommend the brisket hash and smoked salmon benedict. And of course when you're at Lido you must get a bottomless mimosa. The bottomless here is an excellent deal because the ratio of sparkling to OJ is solid (at least 4:1) and the staff constantly refill everyone. I challenge you to get more than halfway through your glass before it is topped up again. You may be feeling very merry by the end, but isn't that what bottomless brunch is all about?Although I usually just brunch here the dinner menu here is also very decent. As an additional incentive to get folks in seats late night Lido has started doing a late night happy hour on Friday nights where they offer 2 for 1 drinks from 10:30pm until close. Definitely worth checking out.So to conclude:* Brunch skillets - just do it* Bottomless mimosas - it would be rude not to* Make a reservation and be on time for it - this place is popular* Late night happy hour on the weekend - you know you want to...and that's all folks!",5.0 star rating,"New York, NY",3,0,0.600000023842,9.60000038147,"Lido,brunch menu,Whole Foods,crowd,Harlem,folks,lot,market,restroom.,fixture,restaurant,ambiance,reason,food,décor,experience,mimosa,place,amount,Everyone,deal,ratio,staff,point,line,folks forms,turnover,things,top,urgency,brunch dish,order,Truffle Oil,incentive,dinner menu,carnivores,friends,salmon,course,exception,brisket hash,service,glass,White Polenta,mimosas,drinks,seats,place,Poached Eggs,Parmigiano Reggiano,stressed.My,Mushroom Ragu,folks,OJ,brunch,Brunch skillets,brunch,Bottomless,reservation,out.So,everyone,staff,end","2,7,3,1,2,1,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,2,6,1,3,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,1,7","0.427380442619,0.0537819936872,0.0504429414868,0.0471589751542,0.0361216925085,0.0276089981198,0.0266022589058,0.0225887708366,0.0168313570321,0.0130661837757,0.0119988061488,0.0105402404442,0.0105402404442,0.00983739923686,0.00860938709229,0.00860938709229,0.00849290098995,0.00808482337743,0.0070449761115,0.00692966720089,0.00650028232485,0.00641850521788,0.00621524965391,0.00579403946176,0.00579403946176,0.00579403946176,0.00579403946176,0.00576436612755,0.00576436612755,0.00575312459841,0.00575312459841,0.00575312459841,0.00575312459841,0.00549539970234,0.00546916387975,0.00525615457445,0.00525615457445,0.00525615457445,0.00524831935763,0.0051047988236,0.00463079521433,0.00440942542627,0.00437344750389,0.00422616070136,0.00420533958822,0.00390346860513,0.00390346860513,0.00377690768801,0.00340712093748,0.00340712093748,0.00340712093748,0.00340712093748,0.00339032988995,0.00310379313305,0.00301583996043,0.00269794557244,0.00246218242683,0.00229419698007,0.00209367740899,0.00203397683799,0.0019637523219,0.0019637523219,0.00171405589208"

Bright cozy room, ambience & cleanliness- food is tasty yet small portion, we once made Lido our brunch meeting spot for the coziness & their beloved bottomless mimosa. We kind of stopped going to Lido brunch because the place is packed and there usually is a long waiting time for brunch hours. We also discovered along the way some big portion food with bottomless option in midtown/downtown area. As much as I love Harlem's restaurants development, it's crazy how many ""nice"" restaurants in Harlem can charge you more with less food portion than some midtown/downtown establishments. At the end of the day, a girl just wants to enjoy yummy food, get tipsy, and leave with full tummy!! I no longer go to their brunch but still love to visit Lido from time to time. Normally for an intimate quiet dinner/late afternoon to catch up with a friend. Perfect ambience for a date as well. I can say, if you are not sure where to take your friend/date, you can not go too wrong by selecting Lido. If you are big on drinks like me, your bill can come out little pricey for dinner. (Wish there was a great happy hour deals here during weekdays, not just at the bar but at the tables as well. And I definitely would love to visit more often!) I have to also mention that at Lido, the food is always consistent- no surprises, no hit-or-miss, which is surprisingly not always the case at many restaurants. Always the same quality, perfectly cooked fish or meat.

Lido,5532,2168 Frederick Douglass Blvd,New York,10026.0,198388,"I've come to Lido in the past and had a wonderful experience! However, I came with a friend recently for brunch and I must say, I was very shocked this time around. Aside from my awesome cocktail (I had the Camomilla Martini, which was well balanced and definitely not light on the booze), the food and service were very lackluster. My friend and I both ordered the short rib hash, with scrambled eggs as opposed to the poached -- the hash was bland, lacked texture (mush is pretty accurate) and was skimp on the potato. It was served over an engish muffin which wasn't toasted and became soggy, and my eggs were dry.

When I want something savory, the brisket Benedict is killer, also huge in proportion.Dinner: Caprese salad with peaches is excellent, as are the nightly specials. Dessert: chocolate budino is by far my favorite. Having had this, I'm disappointed when Italian restaurants don't have this dish. It's so good.As for the ambience, so lovely.

Both experiences were wonderful--but the winter menu is beyond divine. I took some out of town friends here--all of us have worked in the restaurant business for long periods of our lives and while we're not snobs, we truly enjoy a good restaurant experience. And boy, we got one! Every single dish was delicious and mouth-watering. The service was absolutely top-notch. Our waiter was cordial but not invasive and really made sure we were happy throughout the night. As for food, the stars of the night were:-the Octopus with Grilled Sweet Italian Sausage Vinaigrette, Orange, Potato, Olives--basically, I never want to eat anything again without sausage vinaigrette-the Pappardelle with braised lamb: classic winter fare that makes you feel cuddly and warm. The portion size was also perfection... not so much that I felt I had to roll out of there.-Grilled Hangar Steak: I'm a total steak snob--I RARELY if EVER order it out because I make a MEAN rare (really rare) steak at home and am always disappointed when they don't take my ""rare"" request literally. Lucky for me my honey did order it that night and it was too-die-for. I can't wait to go back--especially since I noticed their deep bar.

You literally have patrons squatting and going  through the pile of umbrellas on the floor to find theirs. Given my umbrella was black and there at 8 more like mine not fun to do. Please buy another umbrella rack!  As mentioned the restaurant was half empty, yet they insisted on sitting everyone bunch together in one section of the restaurant. It also appears as if they have tried to put a few more two seater tables. I literally felt claustrophobic and I am use to tight seating in restaurants in Manhattan. Our server was adequate. The appetizer the butternut squash soup was lackluster. Honestly, had better soup from the hot bar at Whole foods. Our pasta dish same results bland, and severed slightly above room temperature. The lemon and white chocolate cheesecake was average. So for $130, we got bland, average food and wine not chilled properly. Too many choices in the area and at this price point! May be it was an off night, but truly a let down. Won't be turning anytimesoon.

The brunch menu is a decent size, but unimaginative-- your standard brunch fare of Benedicts, omelettes, and French toast, accompanied by traditional mimosas and bloody Mary's. To start, I had a Bloody Mary. It was good, nothing noteworthy, but a rather small glass. For my entree, I chose the short rib hash Benedict. The waiter assured me that there wouldn't be mostly potatoes in the hash, and that there'd be a good portion of short rib, and he was correct. Definitely no shortage of meat when the entree arrived to the table. However, something was off because the sauce from the short ribs made the English muffin base soggy and inedible. As for the flavor, also just okay. I wound up asking for some Tabasco sauce to liven it up. My bf ordered an omelette that I took one bite of and didn't want any more. My cousins ordered the French toast which was just a piece of Italian bread, grilled in butter, served with fruit, syrup, and whipped cream. The atmosphere inside was LOUD.

We liked it so much the first time we decided to bring my mother-in-law with us for another go!We started with the Creamy Garlic Parmesan Bread Crostini and the Warm Arugula Salad. The garlic white sauce that sits in-between the bread and cheese on the crostini is really the star of the dish. The salad was also delicious, with the white balsamic vinaigrette really standing out against the walnuts and shaved parmesan.For our main course, we each had different dishes. My mother-in-law had the incredible Spaghetti with Veal Meatballs, San Marzanos, Basil, and Parmesan (which I had the first time we went to Lido - gotta admit, I was eyeing her plate the *whole time*). My wife had the Spinach Ricotta Tortellini (get a bite of the tortellini, with a little bit of ricotta, some of the cream sauce, and a few of the baby peas for *maximum effect*). I had the Halibut with Lemon Risotto, with perfectly-cooked fish and a really well-balanced lemon flavor in the risotto.The best way I can describe the food at Lido is via a quote from the chef-instructors at one of our cooking classes: ""When building a dish, you need to strive to have a variety of flavors and textures so that every bit is different, and your mouth stays interested for the entire meal.""And last, but not least, our server Rachael was awesome. She was friendly, attentive, and even invited us to an off-broadway show she's creative director for after noticing the Van Gogh artwork on our credit card! Super super cool.

They have a kale salad that blows my mind. I've asked about how it is prepared and they told me that the kale is grilled before it is sautéed with fresh cooked and slightly mashed cannelloni beans, rosemary and a sherry vinaigrette. The result is a slightly smokey, slightly creamy, rather unexpected party in the mouth. Whatever they are doing there, it is magic. I like kale fine, but this is kale elevated to a higher level - I don't just crave it, I dream about it and I keep coming back for it. Dishes others have mentioned (truffled gnocchi, veal meatballs etc) are also standouts. But the main reason I come here is the staff - folks are friendly, they give a crap about you having a good time and it shows. Because of the vibe they create, a visit there, whether solo (sit at the bar, you are guaranteed to make friends) or with a group, you are taken care of and will leave a little lighter.

This wouldn't have been a problem if the meal didn't cost $17. Thankfully, the pancakes I split were pretty good.  I don't actually like blueberries, so I appreciated that there were enough to get the flavor, but not so many that I was eating blueberries and pancakes.  The pancakes were cooked exactly the way I like them, crisp around the edges, but not overcooked/hard/dry.Drinks 5/5The real saving grace of the meal was the unlimited mimosas, which I think cost $13.  Perhaps it's just the places I've been, but I'm always concerned that a bottomless mimosa brunch is going to come with some sort of fine print, but this was not the case here. Whatever orange juice was mixed in was flavorful and, at the same time, there was a good amount of champagne so I didn't feel cheated.  In addition, our waitress, whose name I did not get, lived up to my friend's billing as ""the best waitress ever.""  Rarely did I get my glass past the halfway mark without her rushing over.  In addition, she gave us ample warning about last call and did not slow up service as the end drew near.Overall 3.5/5Considering the quality/price of the food I had, 4 stars seems like a bit much, but I can't help shake the fact that I walked away from brunch today wondering about the next time I'll return.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,198824,"Normally this restaurant is a staple on the 'good enough' circuit in Brooklyn Heights, but tonight Lychee Nut has earned a permanent place in family history as the worst Chinese restaurant...ever!  Here is the true story. Our $40 dinner for 5 began with Egg rolls and egg-drop soup.  The egg rolls were a bit brown in appearance, but  when I bit into one, it was literally charred on the inside - I had to spit it out immediately, ungracefully.  Bleh.  Wonton Soup was suspicious, but the fried wonton strips that came with it tasted and smelled and tasted like crayons (crayons!).  We dredged the strips back out but the soup was just too awful to continue.  Next up: steamed pork dumplings, a mass of gooey grey mushballs.  These were impressive because the inside was bright pink pork grindings - too pink.  Subsequent extended microwaving did not cook the pork - perhaps it was fireproof.    The shrimp dumplings appeared passable (literally 'not bad') to the rest of the table, I was too afraid to try them.Our main course, which was still technically the appetizer because we didn't actually eat anything of substance yet: Slimy Chicken fried rice and burned-pork pork fried rice.  The chicken was cooked, but suspiciously soft: we decided it was too suspicious to eat and scraped it off our plates.  The scraped plates looked like we'd been eating steamed okra.   Desperate, we finished with the fortune cookies.  At this point the meal had fallen into a comedy of food disparagement.  Joining in, I bet the table that 'at least the fortune cookies would be good, as they were shrink wrapped'  luckily nobody took me up on the bet.  Instead of breaking in half, these cookies were so rubbery and tough it took a few cycles to break it open.  Our youngest gently unfolded his into a shape that resembled the ear-shaped eavesdropper from Harry Potter.  In the most poignant piece of fortune cookie irony ever, my fortune was:   Aren't you glad you just ate a great meal!To cap it all off, we had to scrape all this 'food' back into a huge garbage bag and lug it back down four floors to the garbage.  Obviously I am upset - at the food, at the huge waste of time that includes getting more food, and at my fellow Yelp raters for giving this place such a high average rating.  At best this place is just average.  Dear owners: please take it upon yourselves to dramatically improve or go out of business quickly - people do not deserve this.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.40000000596,11.6999998093,"restaurant,place,restaurant,staple,Lychee Nut,circuit,family history,crayons,chicken,course,egg-drop soup,Chinese,Brooklyn Heights,story,fried wonton strips,Egg rolls,food,appearance,dinner,fortune cookies,place,egg rolls,strips,soup,Wonton Soup,waste,rest,fortune cookies,appetizer,inside,pork dumplings,table,shrimp dumplings,Chicken fried rice,pork fried rice,fortune,meal,pork grindings,plates,table,mushballs,mass,substance,anything,plates,food disparagement,comedy,okra,garbage,meal,shape,microwaving,floors,garbage bag,piece,fortune cookie irony,average,owners,food,raters,rating,business,people,nobody,cycles,bet,half,eavesdropper,Yelp,Harry Potter,cookies","2,7,2,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,5,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,5,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,2,1,7,5,7","0.0713772624731,0.0584878847003,0.0584878847003,0.0577472224832,0.0574952922761,0.0466962046921,0.0466962046921,0.0324230417609,0.0313730351627,0.0284091420472,0.0278834588826,0.0277875699103,0.0277875699103,0.0273219421506,0.027064813301,0.0253775790334,0.0251887924969,0.0245963726193,0.0222208816558,0.0174750369042,0.0138049861416,0.0109901158139,0.0096158310771,0.00852437876165,0.00749212875962,0.00729832099751,0.00709910830483,0.00697088427842,0.00687965517864,0.00676377676427,0.00648363400251,0.00645753741264,0.00645753741264,0.00645753741264,0.00645753741264,0.00619594193995,0.00619240524247,0.00603511696681,0.00590313971043,0.00588166713715,0.00567318918183,0.00567318918183,0.00565034896135,0.00565034896135,0.00560579216108,0.00515056354925,0.00515056354925,0.00503080105409,0.00438528135419,0.00438528135419,0.00429275725037,0.00417379615828,0.0038368308451,0.0038368308451,0.0038368308451,0.0038368308451,0.00376180745661,0.00364038115367,0.00359083409421,0.00265478389338,0.00265478389338,0.00265157781541,0.00265157781541,0.00189045409206,0.00186519627459,0.00168653519358,0.00168523890898,0.00168401771225,0.00157143012621,0.000996694201604,0.000987021485344"

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,111026,"This place doesn't have enough one star ratings.After walking around with a friend of mine for an hour trying to figure out what to eat we decided on this place realizing we had a craving for Chinese (originally I wanted Thai - he didn't). I'm only in Brooklyn for the week house-sitting for a friend and I don't know the area well but I remembered seeing this take out menu left out for me in the apartment.When we sat down I didn't really know what to expect. I saw a good amount of people in there and thought it couldn't possibly be that bad. BOY WAS I WRONG! After being seated our waiter came over about 10 minutes later and then impatiently took our drink order. He brought over two glasses of waters. I took a sip and thought I was drinking seltzer. It was disgusting. I noticed that our water had bubbles in it from dirty glasses. I stuck to the tea.We ordered our food and again the water impatiently took our order with a straight face. The food came out in mere minutes. This raised a cautious flag in my head. ""How fresh is this food?"" I asked myself. I had the Szechuan Bean Curd and it was absolutely disgusting. Less than halfway through I realized that my food was served on a dirty plate. Every so often when I looked around the restaurant our waiter was looking at our table smirking. Odd... I also had the Steamed Veggie Dumplings which were bland and rubbery and also served on a dirty plate that was obviously scrapped to give the impression that it was cleaned but it wasn't.My friend actually enjoyed his Beef Fried Rice even though, to me, it looked pretty gross. I couldn't tell if this was also served on a dirty plate but I had a good idea that it might have been. My brown rice also tasted burnt.

Veg dumplings, veg lo mein & broccoli w/ garlic sauce. Nothing major nor difficult for ANY Chinese restaurant. I figure it should be here in 30-40 mins max and we'd be eating by 7:30p. I call back at 7:55pm to ask about the delivery. I got yelled at for using a credit card (so why is it an option), told it was a Sunday night so they're busy and because I used a credit card my food has not even left yet and it could take another hour. Are you kidding me? And you couldn't tell me that over an hour ago when I ordered so I could find a better option? Needless to say I cancelled my order instead of waiting 2 hours for Chinese food. I ordered out tonight because I'm sick, I've been cleaning all day and I have a child as well as myself who needs dinner, the last thing I wanted to do tonight was cook and wash a sink full of dishes. Well now thanks to Lichee Nut I'm cooking dinner after my daughter is normally in bed. Please work on your customer service skills.

I went by myself during my lunch break and they sat me right next to a group of 3 men who were to my right, and who stared at me the whole time. Awkward. Then, because they have the tables arranged such that two two-person tables are grouped together, they sat a man down at the table that was doubled with my table, to my left, so it was even more awkward. He was staring at my bill (that they gave me AS SOON AS THEY BROUGHT MY FOOD) which was awkward. At this point, all I could do was stare at my food or stare straight ahead. Let me point out that there were PLENTY OF OTHER TABLES where they could have seated me as well as the guy whom they seated right next to me to the left, so that we would have been spread out and more comfortable, but for their own convenience, as opposed to the customer's convenience, they chose to cram us all together. However, there was another woman  patron sitting alone and she didn't have to be crammed with other people so I don't even know what determines where they seat their customers. They also questioned whether I even wanted to see the menu at all and as soon as they handed it to me they practically pounced on me to put my order in, and again, as soon as they brought the food, they brought the check (although they did not do this to the aforementioned party of 3 men seated to the right of me). They didn't even ask if I wanted anything else or if I wanted dessert. Of course, this is convenient for me because whenever I go there, it's usually for my lunch break, so the clock is ticking, but it's still not proper etiquette and gives off the appearance that they are trying to get you in and out as quick as possible for their own sake.The waiter I've had the past two times wasn't pleasant at all. Also, in order to get by, this waiter gruffly pushed in a chair, the legs of which my foot was leaning against, as it was the chair in front of me, which effectively pushed my foot in. Even though he probably didn't realize that my foot was leaning on the leg, he could have been a little more cautious and poised about how he navigates the restaurant.In sum, the seating arrangement is horribly awkward and the overall service is unsatisfactory, although quick.

You can't expect China town quality food here. What do you mean by no meat. There's meat attached to the bone. We don't make the duck here.

He talked to me like I have never eating out before and I am so dumb that I can't tell meat and bone. He tried to convince me to consume the poor quality food than offer to refund or exchange to something else. I was so mad. I repeated myself many times that I ordered roasted duck noodle and not roasted duck bone noodle. The waiter still tried to convince me that this is the quality they serve here. I have no choice but suck it up. He ended up taking the 6 pcs of bones off my dish and gave me roasted pork instead after 10 minutes of argument. The roasted pork was not any better than the duck. It was obviously bought else where and microwaved before served. I had one bite of the meat and it's so dried and not fresh . I took a picture of the pork.

Got to love the ease of seamlessweb.com menu ordering websites. However, when I entered everything into the website, it said they didn't deliver to my apartment; which is only 0.7 miles away. I called to clarify, and after only giving my address number  to the nice gentleman over the phone, he completed my street address. Ok, now I am good to go...except that after giving my order and being told it would take 30-45 minutes, it took an hour and 20 minutes. (stomach growls)Onto the food:I got the steamed little juicy buns and they were indeed little but not juicy. I do like my buns juicy! (add your dirty quip here)The roast pork entrée was fair. A bit liquid-y but fair. I was hoping the roast pork to be more of a roasty and succulent nature. However it was your typical thin slices of barbeque pork with the bright red outer layer. Some pieces were nice and fatty, but most were nothing to write home about.The hot and sour soup had good flavor. It was a bit lacking in the quantity of chunks of ingredients. There were pieces of tofu and meat here and there, but for the most part, the soup was just liquid.Thank you for the drug baggie of sauces and fortune cookies. How nice!!

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,5686,"First Impression: I love this place! Usual Platter: Shrimp with Walnuts & brown rice. New fave: Beef and Broccoli with White rice and lemons on the side. Overall Review:  Atmosphere: The place is very well decorated: The mahogany tables, wood paneling and the tea kettles on every table make it feel like such a comfortable place to dine. From the hours of 11AM to about 2:30 PM the place us buzzing. Seating is limited and you might end up at a small table right next to other diner's but the atmosphere is so fun that you don't mind too much. Food: The portions are decent. The taste in the food isn't as flavorful as the Chinese food I usually eat but it might be because the food is healthier.  Their shrimp are really small but good.  Each table has chips with a small bowl of duck sauce, and a tin kettle of hot tea. The flavors go very well together and its a great snack before and during your meal. Service: The servers for the most part rush back and forth and aren't exactly attentive or sweet or anything, but they bring the food pretty expeditiously Thumbs down for: The majority of the servers do not understand English very well. The servers are very fast and sometimes they walk away when I haven't finished explaining my order. Thumbs up: The ambiance. The table and platter presentations. The Owners (husband and wife I think) very sweet couple who take the establishment seriously. The delivery comes fairly quickly.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,198396,"Lichee Nut is an old standby for whenever I'm visiting my sister and brother-in-law in Brooklyn Heights, and while it's not gourmet by any stretch, its full of the humble charm that defines the neighborhood.Very warm and comfortable lighting, with a soft wood decor--along with those cheap red ribbons and banners that every Chinese restaurant seems to have. There are a few small flies flitting about fairly consistently, though; not enough to bring the health rating into question, but it can be bothersome.I order their pork bun appetizer pretty regularly--which I shouldn't, because it's as filling as a full meal. The outer bread melts slowly in your hands, as does the pork while you chew. Their veggie dumplings are surprisingly good too; most vegetable dumplings tend to have a stringy quality. They also don't come apart and lash at your lips, like the incomparable but murderously hot dumplings at Prosperity. They're dense and satisfyingly chewy, even if the taste is a little flat. It's the entrees that bring Lichee Nut into the realm of comfort food. Portions are generous, and even their eggplant with garlic sauce is as filling as their meat-centric dishes. My favorites are their General Tso's chicken and shrimp. Avoid dishes that try to do too much, however. For example, the Phoenix and Dragon promises a lot: tender chicken and succulent shrimp merging in a yin yang of Schezuan and sweet-and-sour sauce, along with veggies and mushrooms. The chicken ends up overpowering the shrimp--and the plate has more chicken than shrimp, perhaps in acknowledgement of this. I found myself resorting to the shrimp for a break from the chicken, and the taste of the chicken was only amplified by my dissatisfaction with the shrimp.

It's more out of habit than this being my favorite place. I prefer eating in the restaurant. It's got a nice setup, and usually isn't packed to the tip, so you get some breathing room when you're seated. Not the most amazing Americanized Chinese you're going to get in NYC--probably not by a long shot--but I've never had anything that tasted off or horrendous. Some plates are definitely blander than others. I think the General Tso's, the Sesame Chicken, and the Orange Chicken plates are a little gummy. The chicken is too coated and too chewy. I love the crispy noodles that you get when you eat-in. Unfortunately, I was told by a server once that you can't get them wrapped to go if you don't finish your table's bowl--at least, not without paying for them. I didn't really understand that, considering the noodles were already served on the table, but I am not one to argue about whether I can take complimentary crispy noodles with me. What I also have noticed is that I have to ask our server to bring them out every time I go there. They are complimentary, you just have to advocate for yourself! Go get the crispy noodles you deserve! I also love the tea they serve when you eat-in. I think the service is not consistent. I've had rude and impatient servers, and I've had servers who made me feel welcome and looked after. I have never waited longer than a minute or so to be seated. I don't really think the food here is very amazing either. If I'm in the area, I'll suggest hitting up my old favorite, but I'm kind of loyal to this place just because I've been with it for so long. It's not a need-to-go place by any means. Cozy spot. Nice decor. I like that you have to walk down the stairs to get in. It makes it feel more special somehow.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,107282,"The main reason I'm writing this is the very very bad service we received by the waiter. The waiter didn't respect us and didn't treat us properly. But overall the food is delicious. They need to fire all their current waiters and get a new better waiter, then their restaurant will be booming. The Problems: 1. waiter shouting at customers2. waiter coming to take your order right after a minute they just gave you the menu. 3. waiter coming to give you the bill/check when you're not even finished with eating food because they wanted  you to leave quickly and let more customers to come in. 4. when you give tips, waiter demand it in cash and at least minimum $3. 5. waiter talking very aloud with their coworker to the point where all the customers can hear. Me and three of my friends came here to eat since we love asian foods. When we walked in around 6pm on tuesday, we saw the left side of restaurant is where all of the customers are sitting and the right side of the restaurant is empty. So when we went to sit to the empty chairs in right side of the restaurant, the waiter said ""it is for reserved only,"" in a bad way by shouting. So we were assigned to sit in the left side of the restaurant. We sat down on not-reserved section and the waiter handed us the menu. While we sat and deciding on what to order. The waiter came back right to us right after one minute to take our order, it was so fast. We all weren't ready to order. But my friends ordered their food what they usually eat at chinese restaurant anyway. I told the waiter, I'm still deciding and come back after one minute. When I was ready to order, I called him over and ordered my food. The food came at our table. The food looked delicious and it also tasted delicious too. The waiter gave us check when we are not even finish eating. They wanted us to leave quickly so more customers can come in. when we were standing up to leave the table, the waiter said ""shu shu shu shu"" by pushing us slightly, so we talked among our friends saying how rude that is when we were leaving. The manager or the person who is at cashier witnessed and heard our whole leaving the restaurant situation and yet didn't even do or say nothing.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,72328,"O-I-L.  Thats it.  Now you may think I'm talking about oily food, nope! I ordered moo shu vegetable for take out.  For those who eat this dish you know it comes with plum sauce and pancakes to make the moo shu wrap.  So where am I going with this? Where was the oil? IN MY PLUM SAUCE.  I can not begin to explain how disgusted I was.  Imagine you ask  for ketchup, mustard, duck sauce or any condiment and you get it with a LAYER of oil on top. Plum sauce is not a salad dressing it is typically the texture of jam.  Its like a plum puree that you put on the pancake before you add the moo shu - its supposed to enhance the flavor not slide around the container because oil is in it. It is seriously the equivalent of having oil in your jam or ketchup.  YUCK.  Without it - the moo shu is not the same.  I bought the plum sauce back to Lichee the next day.  I braced myself for a possible confrontation.  Instead the guy behind the counter, laughed and was lighthearted, friendly even (maybe because of all the reviews saying they are mean).  But he said oh, this is dumpling sauce not plum sauce.  He sent a server to the kitchen and she came back with the same exact sauce.  Plum sauce with oil.  He lied and gave me the SAME exact oily sauce I returned, this time with less oil- less oil making a thinner layer on top.  But STILL OIL.  So my decision is to never eat there again.  The food is mediocre at best. But what stands out to me is that instead of being honest, apologetic and bringing me real plum sauce they lied and said it was dumpling sauce which shouldn't have a layer of oil on top either.  It makes me think what else they could be lying about. I don't know.  Are times so hard where they need to ""stretch"" their sauces by adding oil? So gross.  Ok - Im done - don't eat here.  Brooklyn Heights can do better.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,11150,"It completely befuddles me when someone slams a place like this for not serving up authentic Chinese food. If that's what you want, you're not likely to find it here...or anywhere on Montague Street for that matter. You come here for one thing and one thing only - Americanized Chinese food. Lunch specials here are the way to go. You get an entree, your choice of soup or iced tea (think Lipton mix and water), and crispy wonton strips for $6.95, which rivals most meal prices in the area and given the amount of food you get for it, this is a great deal. Dining in also allows you free hot tea, though service can range wildly from warm to dismissive, and it all depends on timing. If you choose to stay during the lunch hour, expect brusque service - choose your order within seconds, eat it within fifteen, and no lingering after your plates have been taken away. Come during the quieter hours of the afternoon and you'll find that things slow down for the better. Since my lunch hour at work falls squarely during the chaotic period at Lichee Nut, I usually get takeout. I place my order from my desk at work, walk five to eight minutes to the restaurant, and my food is usually waiting for me by the time they get there. If I were a more suspicious person, I'd wonder if these people are secretly order-stalking me or hiring clairvoyant chefs to man the kitchen. Most of the time, I'm just happy that my hangries have found a quick cure. Note: any time I come to pick up the order, the lone woman at the desk is handling dining checks, answering the phone, AND disseminating takeouts. It is easy to ream them out for the snappy phone calls (and I've been on the other end of those once or twice), but the last time I was waiting there for about a minute for my food, the phone rang once. every. five. seconds. If I had to do that for a few hours, I imagine I'd soon violate some social norms of politeness. To avoid phone fights like the ones a few yelpers have mentioned, speak clearly, know what you're ordering, and choose your order options in advance (white/fried rice, soup/tea, etc.). Yelp provides the menu online. Use it. I generally order the broccoli with garlic sauce, and if you receive any 'with rice' entree in a takeout container from this place, it's going to seem like there is a disproportionate ratio of rice to entree, but fret not. After placing several orders here, I realized they plop the rice on last, so there's usually more food buried below it; you just have to dig for it.

I ask if they have iced tea, she shakes her head all while looking down at a paper she's taking orders on. I ordered the iced tea. I ask if I can sit anywhere. She asks me if I want to sit down, I tell her yes and motion over at the empty chairs. She calls out to one of the servers and starts screaming in mandarin. Then she tells me if I'm going to sit I ""have to tip."" I say of course! The audacity of this rude young lady. I had a few tips I spared her. Now to the bland shrimps plated in a drenched garlic sauce with big slices of onion and chopped green pepper. It was half decent in taste. The egg fried rice was ok. It was warm, not even hot. The iced tea was watered down. I finished the rice and picked out the shrimp from the garlic soup of a gravy it sat in. I couldn't even finish my plate of food. I kindly walked out after I placed a undeserved tip on the table. Two things I always remember; when I receive exceptional service and when I receive poor service. I would never step foot in there again.

Lichee Nut,5535,162 Montague St,Brooklyn,11201.0,198751,"This place is authentic in a very weird way -- it is a faithful representation of an inauthentic style.Some background:  I moved to the US from Taiwan when I was 11.  Everywhere I went in the US, people treated me to their local Chinese food places, which always had food that tasted like nothing I could remember from Taiwan.For a while I thought it was a regional thing -- Cantonese cuisine is not very authentic in Taiwan either, and back then the Chinese in America were overwhelmingly of Cantonese descent, and the Chinese restaurants in the US were similarly almost entirely of Cantonese derivation.  But then I talked to some kids of Cantonese descent, or who have been to Hong Kong, and they told me all this stuff is nowhere to be found over there either.  As an adult, I traveled in China quite a bit, and I can tell you that nothing I had anywhere in China tasted anything like what has been concocted in the States.It was in this way that I was introduced to the style of cooking known as ""American-Chinese.""Do not confuse that with ""Chinese-American.""  The word order makes a difference.  ""American Chinese"" food was invented in America by Chinese immigrants or their descendants based on American appetites and tastes and locally available ingredients.  Over time, it evolved into its own style that uses Chinese cooking techniques but which has little semblance to anything you would find anywhere in China.  In fact, it is so different from anything you would find in China, it has been ""reverse-imported"" to China -- there are lots of ""American-style Chinese food"" recipes on Chinese websites, and it's all stuff like sweet and sour shrimp (basically shrimp breaded and fried and then served in a sweet and sour sauce), that originated in the US.This place makes stuff like that.  The ""Chinese food"" you would see in a strip mall in the Midwest.  The ""Chinese food"" you would see at a takeout window at a truck stop in the middle of nowhere.  The ""Chinese food"" that is made from five gallon drums of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and MSG.  It is faithful to such recipes even today, when many people have been exposed to ""real"" Chinese food..Though I do not endorse the style, eating it is an act of nostalgia for me, because it reminds me of the old days, when hardly anyone in America knew what the hell real Chinese food tasted like, and this is what I would end up eating when I went out for Chinese -- in the last twenty years, most Chinese places have ended up being taken over by recent Chinese immigrants, who would proceed to cook something like actual Chinese food.  This place, however, has stayed true to its roots, and is authentic to its style -- American Chinese food.  Once in a great long while, I would stop in for a quick stirfry (which is almost always chunks of meat battered and deep fried before being tossed into the stir fry wok with some chopped vegetables and some kind of nondescript brown sauce made from soy sauce and corn starch) and indulge my nostalgia, but would get the hell out pretty quick, because the whole place also smells of stale frying grease to the degree that I do not understand how this place's ventilation system passes code well enough for them to stay open.  However, to some degree, even the smell reminds me of all the takeout-only places I've eaten at, and so is oddly enjoyable to a degree, but I really can't take it for long.If you are from some part of the US where you grew up eating this stuff, and either prefer it or would like to

Decided to try this place since Andys is gone and my boyfriend and I were in a mood for chinese. The visit started off well, the place was pretty empty for a saturday afternoon..our waiter was prompt on taking our order, my boyfriend and I ordered the wonton soup ..they arrive moments after however a hair is discovered in mine after one scoop of the spoon. I show our waiter who asks if I would like the tea instead, i decline and ask for water, our water arrives and before I could take a sip my boyfriend is holding up his glass in disgust, there is a lipstick stain on the rim. At this point we decide the A was not the restaurants true standards, I call the waiter over and show him the glass, he shakes his head and says ""ok if you dont want to eat here you dont have to""..I ask for a manager and he walks away. At this point we are gathering our items, we explain the situation to the woman at the front desk who claims there is no manager present. The woman then exhanges words with our waiter who then yells in another language and I am completly shocked! We gave him nothing but respect despite his attitude and bad service, I express this to the woman as well as request for him to speak english if he is going to address the issue. The woman then translates he allegedly  said there was no hair in the soup nor lipstick stain on the glass...by then the soup was taken however I walk to the table and show her the glass and stain. No apologies just silence as she shows him and removes herself.

The chicken and broccoli marks a 1 on a 10 point scale. Decent General Tso's. And the delivery guys are saturated with major attitude. Delivery tip is NOT supposed to be based on a total cost percentage, but with all the idiots tipping their delivery guys 15-20% as they would a waiter who's served and waited on them for at least an hr, lichee nut's delivery guys are expecting 20% at the very least, even more for inclement weather. I've been blatantly cursed out by these guys more than a handful of times for tipping 15% (robbery, i tell ya!!)

I've worked upstairs from this place for about 7 years but have never tried it because I am picky about Chinese food and worried that I wouldn't consider it good. Today I had a craving for spicy szechuan noodles, and figured I would give it a shot.It was 1pm on a Sunday, the door to the restaurant was propped wide open, all of the lights were on, the neon OPEN sign was lit (!) so I walked in and there was a woman standing behind the front counter by the cash register. I said ""do you have spicy szechuan noodles?"" - she looked at me strangely for a few seconds (as if she thought I was going to rob her or something -- I had on yoga clothes ...), then finally very rudely said ""We are not open yet!!"" - that was it, nothing else. I stood there for a few seconds, somewhat taken aback, looked around again and there were no signs that the restaurant wasn't ready for business (again, the door was wide open, the lights were all on, and the open sign was lit!) so I said ""well, you are quite a friendly person aren't you"" and walked out. I will never go there again.I just looked at their website and yes it does say that they do not open until 1:30pm on Sundays but then don't prop your door open and turn all of your lights on!

Try their raw apple pie!--- The hot/cold bars in the back have clear signage to let you know whether the dish is organic, vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free. Finally, someone who knows I hate reading ingredient labels on a 20 minute lunch break.--- Amazing selection of vegan / gluten free desserts and entrees behind the counter. They have all the ingredients listed if you're not in a hurry and you'd like to read them, but they still have the quick and easy to read signage for people like me. I love the vegan ipie and the vegan cinnamon pumpkin cream cheese roll. --- Friendly counter service! They never give me dirty looks for ordering three vegan desserts, which I almost always do.--- Juice bar. Order your fresh pressed beverage, turn around and grab your spicy seitan wrap, kale sesame salad, and you're good to go!--- Free samples! They always have free dessert samples!--- Very reasonably priced. Their vegan entrees are under $10, and vegan desserts range from $2- $5, which is incredibly reasonable when you're looking for a fast meal on the go.CONS: --- Narrow aisles and little walking room. You literally have to stand in one aisle if there are no free cashiers. Fortunately, they always have three to six people at the registers so the wait is never long.Overall, I'd really give this place a shot.

YAY!We call know how KenStarr LOOOOVES Pastries.Shut up.Now, This place has everything you could need and want and more. The hot food when I was there were things like salad, curry tofu, free range chicken (baked) , mixed sauteed veggies, potato salad, macaroni pie, coleslaw, different styles of quinoa and more. And ALLLL these things are marked either vegan or vegetarian so you are well informed of your pick. The best is the food is 1/2 off after 9pm if the weight reached 1 pound or more. The price for food per pound was 9 bucks and change. The delicatessen had things like almond cake, almond cookies, espresso cake, peanut butter cookies, almond rolls, oatmeal raisin cookies, chocolate chip cookies, ginger snap cookies and the like. I purchased an oatmeal raisin cookie because I cant resist oatmeal raisin and a banana strawberry cake which was from the day before. The cookie was heavy on the spice (like ginger, etc) I prefer it not to be so. I purchased one from the farmers market on 14th street that to this day i still dream of. It's a smaller cookie for only 1.50 but the taste just cant be beat! The large cookie was about 2.75 and the cake was over 4 bucks. The cake, since it was not fresh, was better in the middle and towards the frosting. The ends were stale. It would have been awesome had I got it the day of. Not sweet and definitely great for vegan standing.

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,141387,"Whole Foods, I love you baby but...C'mon let's not kid ourselves anymore, you know that things haven't been quite the same for a while now and...well...it's just that EVERYONE comes inside you and I'm starting to feel like, not so special anymore. So, you see, I uh....yah baby, I have another lover. Her name is Lifethyme and she's small and well-stocked as has got real narrow aisles and everything, stacked up way to the top so yannow, it's like TIGHT up in that piece but in a good way. She's cozy and old school, has way more interesting friends like the raw foodist animal rights activist or the macrobiotic yoga and breathwork specialist/djembe player, so like, I kinda like hanging out with her better because it's not like Buffy, Tina, and all the other bleached blondes that are trying to run up in her shit everynight right after work like they do with you. I mean, you don't even get the courtesy of a call, they just like, show up. And in droves. How do you think that makes me feel?Ya see, me and Lifethyme (I call her 'Thyme for short, cuz she's savory like the herb) have something SPECIAL going on. It's not me and her and 5,000 others. When I stop by 'Thyme, I know we're gonna have some nice one-on-one time. I can stroll her fresh produce aisles, and maybe I don't get the crazy selection you offer with your wicked ways, but hey, Meyer Lemons aren't the only game in town, baby! Sometimes a sweet squeeze through some old worn passages is better than all the high-tech fancy exotic organic gadgetry of your oh-so-modern ways. You see, 'Thyme is a little long in the tooth, she's been around way before you came around, and now I understand what they say about older women being like fine wine, you know, that they just get better with age. See, 'Thyme tells me good stories and knows her way around the body of organic knowledge, baby. She's got a book store where I can get cookbooks on sale; her selection of grade B maple syurps is actually BETTER than yours (not to mention honey and agave syurps), the upstairs health and beauty section is almost as good as yours, honey, except maybe a little better edited; she's got everykind of soy and rice milk I could possibly want, organic kitty litter, and her raw food section honey, well let's just say, for an old girl, 'Thyme keeps it RAW, ya heard?!She lures me in with unexpected charms, like those cute little mini shopping carts that are just narrow enough to fit between her tight walls, her FANTASTIC salad bar (I'm sorry Whole Foods, but her organic slaw is probably as delicious as any thing I've had while with you), and the vegan selection is really top notch. She's got a perfect mix of what I expect and the exotic, but it's just right, you know, well-thought-out, considered. In short, WF, 'Thyme is just the kind of broad that keeps bringing lovers back, even if they've been gone for a while. She's small, tight, discrete, but super knowledgeable about her stuff. She's  got everything you do, just maybe not as flashy or as hyped. And best of all, I don't have to share her with the rest of Manhattan. So thanks WF, it was cool while it lasted, but I'm going back to my roots, back to the fresh blended peanut butter, the carob chips and coconut rolled dates of my youth, back to the six-packs of Eden Soy drink boxes, just like when I was first getting my organic on...They say your first love is always your strongest, so with that WF, I hope you find what you're looking for.

He said the store didn't have it. He said the calcium formulations in the store were not calcium carbonate, and that calcium (carbonate) wasn't an antacid.OK, so after I looked on the shelves and found THREE different bottles that had calcium carbonate in them- ON THE LABEL- mind you, I tried to explain to him that the store did have it. And I offered to show him. He was clear that he was a physician with 20 years of experience, reiterated that calcium carbonate wasn't an antacid, and continued to be rude and dismissive.My concern is that someone without a basic understanding of chemistry is doling out herbs and vitamins.It's one of the oldest known chemical and medical facts... It's the active ingredient in Tums. The Romans used it to settle their stomachs. Calcium Carbonate. SEASHELLS. It's use is ancient- prehistoric- as an antacid.  Ignoring that he was aloof and dismissive- the concern is that if he doesn't know this, why do you have him behind the counter?

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,8298,"This cozy little supermarket has gotten me addicted to its raw/organic/vegan well...NOT baked goods, which stand in an open, refrigerated space as you make your way down the right side of the store (perhaps I shouldn't have given you directions; I want this all for myself!). Within this case is a plethora of interesting granola bars, cookies, puddings, etc. I'll tell you about all that I've had, and other's that seem particularly interesting.Coconut and plain ""chewies."" These hefty suckers are perhaps the healthiest cookies you'll ever eat, if they can even be called that. A combination of oats, flax seeds, dates, nuts, cinnamon, and the occasional coconut flake, they are indeed chewy, but also soft, dense, and absolutely delicious. I recommend saving halves for breakfast, as they're practically like eating oatmeal in ball-form, sans sugar as well! The cacao chia seed granola bar is another winner. With a base of oats, flax seeds, nuts, etc, it is covered in a light, moist cacao nib and chia topping; there's almost a fruity quality to it, and I recommend it highly. Then of course are the desserts in which a spoon is needed. My first venture into this puddin cup-world was a rendezvous with the ""Yam Yum Pudding"": pureed yams, cinnamon, cashews, and soy milk. Unfortunately, it managed to explode in my bookbag, but not so much that I wasn't able to get several decent-sized scoops of the refreshing pudding. WIthout any eggs, it wasn't lightened by any means, but it had a clear, fresh taste all its own. Then there's the Quinoa Power Pudding: a mixture of perhaps my favorite grain with soy milk, apples, cranberries, dates, nuts, and Lifethyme's timeless ingredient, cinnamon. Whirred together, they combine to make a great alternative to the quintessential rice pudding (which they have as well), and a healthy one at that. Finally, there is the berry bomb pudding, consisting of a layer of oatmeal/flax seed granola topped by pureed coconut meat and smothered with an organic raspberry and strawberry sauce. Dear god, it is absolutely amazing; a perfect combination of silky, creamy, and chewy. Get it immediately.Unfortunately, the downside to Lifethyme is that, despite how much I may think it's worth the high prices, my debit card doesn't agree. Be mindful of this or you'll be liable to buy the whole store. The buffet itself is $8.99 a pound, so choose wisely. Regardless, if you're starving and in need of a quick, natural energy booster, come to Lifethyme for any one of their delightful desserts.

 The cooked iPie and Sunrise Pie are fabulous.  The raw berry bomb is sinfully delicious - I'm so grateful they started making it with gluten-free oats instead of regular oats.  The raw lasagna is also one of the best in the city (the only other raw lasagna in NYC that comes close is at Peacefood Cafe).  The gluten free baked cakes are light, fluffy, and absolutely melt in your mouth.  They are completely on par with BabyCakes, the nationally famous GF bakery, or the outstanding GF muffins at Peacefood.  In eleven years, I've yet to find one bakery or food bar item I truly disliked.  Most of the big name vegan restaurants can't compare to the food bar items at this little grocery store.  Their deli food is REAL.  It's not white rice flour and soy protein isolate.  It's actual grains, veggies, nuts, and seeds.  As far as groceries, if I lived nearby, I'd probably buy all my food here.  They have a great selection of organic fresh produce, dry cereal & pasta, pre-bagged bulk items, and of course, tons of varieties of dairy-free ice cream!!!  There's always a much shorter line at Life Thyme than at the Union Square Whole Foods, and Life Thyme's prices aren't any higher.  The upstairs seating area is usually very clean, with a great view, and so spacious compared to the Elm Health on 14th St. and 7th Ave.I wish they hadn't stopped making the raw spirulina pie with an obscene amount of almond extract (now it is too mild).  I bet people complained and told them to dial it down, but seriously, it was better when they used 2-3 times more almond extract than any sane person would put in.  ;-)  The old spirulina pie also came in bigger (higher) slices, which I miss.  My only serious complaint is the restroom, which always smells absolutely foul!!!  I thought maybe it would be better after the renovation a few years ago, but it's just as gross as ever.  It needs major ventillation and way more frequent cleaning.",5.0 star rating,"New Rochelle, NY",3,0,0.20000000298,13.8000001907,"steep,prices,food,lasagna,groceries,grocery shopping,someone,lasagna,backpack,sales,food bars,Most,food bar item,raw food preparation,food,pizza,food,people,city,restroom,some,desserts,diet,meal,dehydrator,ocassional,world,food bar items,groceries,berry bomb,slices,oats,oats,best,city,GF bakery,bakery,restaurants,Life Thyme,spirulina pie,mouth,GF muffins,par,name,cakes,grocery store,rice flour,soy protein,grains,veggies,nuts,seeds,cereal,pasta,produce,selection,almond extract,almond extract,Sunrise Pie,person,amount,Peacefood,spirulina pie,NYC,Peacefood Cafe,BabyCakes,complaint,iPie,renovation,cleaning,7th Ave.,Elm Health on 14th St.,ventillation,bulk items,upstairs seating area,line,prices,ice cream,varieties,course,view,Whole Foods,Union Square","1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,1,2,2,7,6,7,7,6,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,3,1,7,7,7,2,2,1,7,7,4,4,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2","0.224948108196,0.0650286227465,0.0504748784006,0.0356865152717,0.0325638279319,0.0298820286989,0.0293990354985,0.0290423370898,0.0241170078516,0.0239939484745,0.0239070151001,0.014342231676,0.0120587684214,0.0112838903442,0.011168773286,0.0111202737316,0.0108645213768,0.010525945574,0.0104517992586,0.0103221088648,0.00914598815143,0.00914598815143,0.00912018399686,0.00909915473312,0.00909915473312,0.00909915473312,0.00908141210675,0.00763770192862,0.00749874766916,0.00748637085781,0.00728681543842,0.0069862739183,0.0069862739183,0.00697695557028,0.00697695557028,0.00696085998788,0.00695380521938,0.00694727990776,0.0067714555189,0.00669449521229,0.00609728321433,0.00609056465328,0.00609056465328,0.0060786800459,0.00572296511382,0.005562718492,0.00555331353098,0.00555331353098,0.00554904900491,0.00554904900491,0.00554904900491,0.00554904900491,0.0055412328802,0.0055412328802,0.0055412328802,0.0055412328802,0.00496875913814,0.00472591910511,0.0045550307259,0.00445889262483,0.00413477793336,0.0041217575781,0.00397699559107,0.00361446873285,0.00361446873285,0.00360612338409,0.00350059382617,0.00340206199326,0.00285634677857,0.00285492651165,0.00244767148979,0.00244767148979,0.00242102751508,0.00228196522221,0.00222137523815,0.00211280258372,0.00194665079471,0.00181569566485,0.00181569566485,0.00181569566485,0.00181339227129,0.00176358700264,0.00107390061021"

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,27020,"I love this place. The variety of healthy, vegetarian, vegan to-go food options are fantastic. In a city with tragically teeny kitchens, I've found myself going to the pre-made sections of grocery stores, mostly due to space constraints for cooking rather than a lack of desire to cook. But so often, these options are...unappetizing. Or super appetizing but not particularly good for me. Sure, I'd love to have 99 cent pizza every night, but if I don't have time to maneuver around in my teeny kitchen to make dinner, I definitely don't have the time to work out for 3 hours every day to burn it off. Lifethyme is an excellent option for a quick bite to go. I'm giving them four stars because as far as grocery stores go, Lifethyme comes up short. Unless you're a raw food purist there are likely going to be things you have to find elsewhere.

I told him it was not  (white sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose), but he insisted it was, whereupon I told him to look it up upon the internet. He then ridiculed me in front of another costumer saying that a lot of stuff on the internet wasn't true (which wasn't my point). I've been a regular costumer since 2007. I feel a little worried that information so wrong can be given out by an authority at a health store. White sugar as opposed to glucose (dextrose) has the potential of triggering an insulin shock.

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,9211,"Mom went to dim sum with her friends, leaving me behind to fend for myself gastronomically. I actually enjoy this 'solo' moment. It's nice to be alone and do what I want to do once in awhile, but when you're 'alone' suddenly, you do get an unexpected panic attack. Ok, this post isn't a psychological venting forum. So let's just stick to the topic shall we?Ok, so I was debating on several options:A - I could save some money and go back home to make something simple.B - have hummus and pita(s).C - a diner's counter.D - a vegetarian restaurantE - grab something and eat in the park since it's so nice out.F - none of the above.I needed to build my immune system due to a sudden health accident, so I thought choice D would be a nice decision. But fate is full of irony. As I got off the W 4th subway station, my weary, hungry feet led me to the growing street # instead of the opposite (aka correct) direction.  Oh crap! Now I'm too tired to walk back.  Long and behold, Lifethyme appeared like a godsend.  It's a very wholesome health store and got everything under the organic gamut - grains, vegetables, fruits, packaged goods, steamed tables, cosmetics, and prepared food.  But I was only interested in one thing - a juice bar.  Now bewarned that the pirces don't come cheaply.  The least expensive is $6 (10 oz.).  I never fancy fruit juice, so I chose the All Green (spinach, celery, kale, collard greens) plus lemon and ginger (recommended by the friendly juice barrista).  I forked over my hard earned moola and took a sip. Pow! This is soooome powerful potion! If you never need a cleansing, this is it.  I would actually suggest adding apple or beet as a natural sweetener if this is your first time.  I sure felt healthy drinking it, but the ginger was so spicy (a good thing I guess) and so grassy tasting (another good thing), I just couldn't down the entire 10 oz.  I felt so defeated at my virgin experience.  This is also a personal lesson for myself  - I can never go raw 100%.  I still need my cooked meals.  Nevertheless, if I ever felt the need to boost my immune system or just feeling under the weather, I know Lifethyme's all green is waiting for me just around W.

 Probably not.) have created toothsome and nutritionally complex breakfast smoothies of coconut meat and coconut water, with such additions as kale, pineapple, banana, etc.  There are other somewhat specific exotic health additives I find myself needing.  Usually they carry the top notch brand.  Aloe vera gel, adzuki or raw white miso (they have a good brand), might need sprouting bags or kefir starter because I'm in the weird black hole of health consciousness where electromagnetic blankets and superfood bottles for baby pigs (I'm lookin at you, Dr. Cassar) hang out.  WHAT I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY HERE: Produce.  Yes, all the produce is organic.  It is also grossly expensive, shipped from across state lines, and not as flavorful (ew, Eli and Ali's tomatoes) as what you can get at your local farmer's market for the same price.  In a pinch I recommend their lemons and papayas, because both are reliably organic and the papayas are delicious.  As for staff.  The service is slow and languid 60% because someone is amiable and neighborly, 40% because you caught someone sullen and rude,  My complements to Carlos for being a laid back and kind and Nick for being a similarly cool and relaxed guy.",4.0 star rating,"New York, NY",4,0,0.300000011921,15.3000001907,"spot,Snacks,snacks,baby,thing vegans,point,Natalia Rose,snacks,detox diets,Most,bunch,town,version,juice,snack tooth,Health nuts,interests,commute,PATH train,cookies,SERIOUS,Cheers,lime juice,someone,someone,everyone,everything,black hole,snacks,superfood snacks,Cassar,hemp seed snacks,seaweed snack,coconut oil,computer programming,underarms,onion stench,name,skin,raspberry cookies,kale chips,cabbage chips,peanut butter chocolate chip cookie,additives,place,best,town,superfood granola bars,superfood energy bars,juice bar,Everybody,cashews,bar none,bakery,counterparts,sorghum flour,nori sheets,sushi,salt cravings,cacao almond truffles,dulse,produce,juice staff,shelves,Produce,style,flavor,bee pollen,sugar rush,chocolate,someone,baby pigs,superfood bottles,blankets,health consciousness,kefir starter,state lines,ew,tomatoes,someone,goji berries,service,Green Champagne,papayas,staff,complements,papayas,farmer's market,price,pinch,kind,guy,both,juice jerks,lemons,Eli,Ali,additions,health additives,kale,brand,brand,breakfast smoothies,coconut meat,banana,pineapple,coconut water,bags,gel,adzuki,miso,Carlos,Nick","7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,5,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,5,5,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,1,2,1,7,6,6,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,1,2,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,1","0.0842859372497,0.0604705773294,0.0604705773294,0.0422703325748,0.0420426651835,0.0370243117213,0.0333303809166,0.0289326515049,0.0254359506071,0.0241909567267,0.02150763385,0.0200753863901,0.0198661126196,0.017713772133,0.0175722893327,0.0175722893327,0.0175722893327,0.017508527264,0.017508527264,0.0125599019229,0.0104158893228,0.0103780301288,0.00958145502955,0.00902331713587,0.00900251045823,0.00870881509036,0.00806153938174,0.00770227797329,0.00736322347075,0.00729885743931,0.006810429506,0.00667949393392,0.00667949393392,0.00667303288355,0.00667303288355,0.00667303288355,0.00667303288355,0.00667303288355,0.00665763719007,0.00582208950073,0.00562757905573,0.00561918597668,0.00560491532087,0.00558781251311,0.00533284619451,0.00510419206694,0.00510419206694,0.00508247222751,0.00508247222751,0.0046431128867,0.00462214369327,0.00447843642905,0.00446578720585,0.00446578720585,0.0044509600848,0.0044509600848,0.0044467812404,0.0044467812404,0.0044467812404,0.0044467812404,0.0044467812404,0.00422709947452,0.0041891024448,0.00417368998751,0.00412350194529,0.00406920397654,0.00406920397654,0.00406920397654,0.00405920064077,0.00404565129429,0.00345661910251,0.00302259065211,0.00302259065211,0.00302259065211,0.00302259065211,0.00302259065211,0.00301769515499,0.00301769515499,0.00301769515499,0.00282192160375,0.00274670822546,0.00255539896898,0.00246464344673,0.0023867522832,0.00238561024889,0.0023845101241,0.00224010669626,0.00208910019137,0.00208910019137,0.00208806130104,0.00208609970286,0.00208609970286,0.00195975927636,0.00194410630502,0.0018393372884,0.00178619928192,0.00178619928192,0.0016689436743,0.00156536605209,0.00151788291987,0.00151595717762,0.00151506287511,0.00132789264899,0.00132789264899,0.00132789264899,0.00132789264899,0.00132789264899,0.00132542557549,0.00132542557549,0.00132542557549,0.00132542557549,0.00123466853984,0.00123466853984"

Their food is so fresh, healthy, and organic. I will walk blocks just to enjoy this healthy meal every day. I love their homemade, raw bite-size cookies, try the chocolate with cherries! It's just a delightful experience! I didn't know food could be so supernatural. I also enjoy sampling their products and meeting their vendors.

When I moved to New York City, I assumed that part of my life would come to a halt; you can't fit a dairy farm in Manhattan. And then I found Lifethyme. Three blocks away from my college, stocked with products reigning from my hometown of Ithaca, NY, and sensibly priced for the broke college student that I am, Lifethyme was a win-win...win. It is clear that this shop has made it their mission to create a complete, natural market, equipped with a juice bar, bakery, supplement counter, body care section, kitchen, and grocery store that delivers. The store has everything. Walk and get all natural groceries, toiletries, dinner, and dessert all in one trip. They even have all natural chocolate! I explored, in awe of the quantity and variety of products. Upon walking it, I was met with the freshest of fruits and vegetables, organic apples happen to be my favorite, then I made it to some dairy products from my home sweet home, then the prepared foods, stocked with raw-vegan, vegan, and vegetarian food, which is great because it's been a while since I've eaten meat. Next I stared at the baked goods; chocolate vegan cakes that made me want to forget about dinner. Making the full circle, I saw the grocery section and realized that I would never have to go anywhere else, they had it all: cereal, bread, pasta, canned soup, canned vegetables, you name it. I was even able to try free samples from Garden of Life, a company that promotes raw and natural energizers and vitamins. Upstairs they had even more! Soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, candles, incense, yoga mats, make-up AND a seating area where I could eat my prepared food and rest my feet. Lifethyme is definitely the place to be if you're looking to live a healthy lifestyle. It's affordable, which I can't say about a lot of New York organic stores, and they provide basically anything one could ever want.

I explained to the guy behind the bar that I have been coming here consistently for over a year getting the same smoothie and was never charged. He got nasty with me so I asked  for the manager. Enrique the manager was calm but didn't offer any solution to the situation just that other employees at the juice bar had been fired since they were not ringing up smoothies correctly. The juice guy then interrupted and proceeded to get loud with me. So I left the smoothie there and walked to find another manager. I found the owners son Jason and explained the situation. He was calm but again offered no solution. I told him I was also needing to buy $30 protein powder for my gf but I wasn't cause the way I was treated.

This kind of food makes me so happy (and it's not because I'm a hipster or feel better than anyone else, as another reviewer mentioned below haha! holy insecure!). Their veggie burger was delicious - very generously proportioned, meaty (or more appropriately, ""beany"") with huge avocado slabs on the top.My only problem with it is that the check out line can get pretty long and leaks into one of the aisles making it extremely tough to get around which makes me a bit claustrophobic.

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,198480,"=I have to say ive been shopping at LifeThyme for over 3 years now & while i agree with everyone about the over pricing of their items, i do however disagree with the reviews about the cashiers. Well almost all of the cashiers. One cashier in particular is Carmen. She is amazing! Shes so full of life and always has this beautiful aura about her. She laughs with you and listens to your problems as if your her family. I really hope Carmen reads this review because she is a woman with a great heart. these 4 stars are for her! If there is anything wrong or a screw up with a pricing she willing goes out and makes sure the pricing is corrected or that you get your money back. I look forward to coming to this store just for her. i know it may sound weird but i try my best to be there when shes working. The rest of the cashiers upfront are cool too, like Cynthia and Lucia. These two girls are new but theyre really sweet. They dont scream at you, like another woman who stands at the first register or other staff who ive seen glued to their phones. Nancy in the deli is such a doll also! Shes always so helpful & recommend my favorite new treat (Lemon Ginger Cookie). =Now lets talk about HBA Benny is just awesome!!! Have you ever met a more compassionate and lovable human being? She is very knowledgeable about her departments, as she should be.She doesnt speak with you like a saleswoman though. No she speaks with you like a human being! Im not saying this just to say it! if you have any worries or questions about your skin go and speak with Benny about it. If theres a product that youd like to see and they dont have it in stock, she will order it for you! What great service. If Benny's not there theres another woman named Sofia who is just as sweet. Although she may not be as helpful, you can see that she is truly trying to help out and i appreciate that. This is what i like about this store their staff is down to earth & raw, just like their prodcuts!=Lastly lets talk about the Juice Bar. Everytime im there i always catch Sabrina and sometimes Roy. Roy is just unquestionably great! So after Melvin left a new girl entered the juice bar. she looked like a child and i was very skeptical that she could fill his shoes. But this girl exceeded my expectations! Since shes started working in the juice bar ive noticed how her confidence grew. at first when a customer would question or complain about something shed look frightened but now she stands her ground and explains everything in detail. you could tell how much she grew out of her shell. Shes really nice and actually quite funny. I remember being extremely stressed out from work and everything just pissed me off and snapped at her for giving me strawberries instead of blueberries in a drink.  (actually i did say strawberries but was to angry to care that i yelled at her for no reason). Instead of correcting me she apologized and made me a fresh drink right away while another customer snapped at me and bought the strawberry one. She didnt say anything she just smiled and asked about my day and i literally broke down infront of her. There was a huge line and it was amazing to see this tiny girl crack open a coconut with only a knife and still make sure i was okay at the same time! Going to the juice bar is now my daily therapy session. Its always fun to go and have a good laugh at the juice bar. You wont even notice how long youd be standing there! Sabrina is great and shes really improved on her juices and drinks. Ill be honest at first her green drink were too bitter and her shakes would be too thick but now if shes not there (or if Roy isnt there) im not getting a drink. I highly recommend you get something made by her! Melvin and DJ would be really proud of her.=okay i think my review is long enough. These are the people i like at the store; they really are quite genuine and makes me want to shop more when theyre around. I do have a few complaints though. One is this new guy at the juice bar; Harvey. I was at lifethyme today & decided to try out this new guy and was greeted with arrogance. I over heard him telling a customer how it was because of his ingenuity that he was able to get his drink.

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,198476,"Until today this would have been a 5 star rating. I love Lifethyme, it has amazing organic produce and an amazing juice bar. We are so lucky to have somewhere like this in the city. However I strictly only eat organic fruits and vegetables. The coconuts had no label on whether they were organic or not. I'd read online that in Thailand (where the coconuts come from), they are often sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals to make them grow. The label said ""Lifethyme young coconut,"" and that was about it. So last week I asked the lady at the counter whether the coconuts were organic or not. She rushed off to ask the lady making juices, and she confirmed that they were. However today when I went to the store, I found some of the coconuts had labels on them. ""Melissa's sweet young coconut,"" they read. I did some research on Melissa's site, and the coconut wasn't listed under the organic section. So I gave them a call. Melissa's stated that the coconuts were not organic and were sprayed with pesticides and other things that they weren't sure about. Although this is not entirely Lifethyme's fault, I feel as though they should have researched where the coconuts come from as they are currently falsely advertising. A simple sign in front of the coconuts would have done the trick. I knew there was something wrong with the coconuts as they are the only fruit/vegetable which does not have a label in the store and I do not appreciate being lied to. To make things worse, twice this week I have bought produce that has no ""use by"" date, and started to go moldy the day after I bought it, (cucumbers and oranges).

I can't help but want to buy a dozen bags of this stuff! Their biggest asset, however, has got to be their desserts. They're somewhat pricey - but for $5 you get a cake slice the size of a baby seal I kid you not that lasts FOREVER. They make some seriously amazing vegan cakes here - I especially dug their chocolate almond cake. Really beautiful stuff!Basically you cannot go wrong spending what money you find valuable here. It's all worth it, because this kind of place really has quality and standards. If I could, I'd shop here every day but that sadly cannot be.

Lifethyme,5536,410 Ave Of The Americas,New York,10011.0,51486,"On Sunday afternoon, I happened to be:1. Walking south on 6th Avenue2. In need of some applesCoincidentally, I passed Lifethyme, the neighborhood natural market, and I decided to take advantage and pick up my apple supply. This was the second time I had been in the store - The first was a while back, about a year ago to the date. I vaguely remembered enjoying the store's products and atmosphere, but I blew the experience off as a one-time deal since I'm rarely in that part of town.  However, once I crossed the threshold to the store and recognized where I was, I breathed a sigh of relief. Organic products everywhere! Fresh produce! Gluten free items! What I loved most about Lifethyme was the fact it carried most, if not all, of the items that either Whole Foods or Trader Joe's have, and the store is not nearly as crowded. It seems to be more a neighborhood gem with a small, distinct demographic (NYU students, Village dwellers, organic/vegetarian foodies), so the vibe was less chaotic, more relaxed. I didn't feel rushed or cramped while I waited in line for one of the 6 small cash registers, and really, I didn't have to hold that long until I paid and was out the door. But alas, I can't rave too much. Although the products and cute atmosphere are both great, there are some negative points that I must note. First, not all of the products are USDA certified organic. I noticed a lot of the fruit and vegetables were either from New Zealand or Mexico, so the USDA organic label couldn't really apply. Also, the store is rather on the small and narrow side. Though I wasn't there during a slam, I can imagine busier moments would make it difficult to shop with ease and comfort. Oh, and one last thing: It's expensive. I can't even sugar coat that. However, natural products tend to be on the pricier side, so I wasn't expecting a huge price difference from that of Whole Foods.I have to say, I like Lifethyme. It's cute, caters to its demographic, and provides a wonderful place for people to find and discover great food.",4.0 star rating,"Boston, MA",3,1,0.20000000298,9.0,"Lifethyme,items,store,advantage,neighborhood,fact,students,need,apple supply,applesCoincidentally,6th Avenue2,products,store,first,store,sugar coat,atmosphere,products,produce,town,part,deal,experience,store,products,neighborhood gem,vibe,one,demographic,atmosphere,threshold,sigh,relief,everywhere,line,cash registers,door,much,side,Whole Foods.,points,comfort,ease,moments,slam,thing,food,Trader Joe's,Village,NYU,price difference,side,demographic,store,products,products,people,place,label,fruit,vegetables,all,USDA,Mexico,New Zealand,lot","7,6,2,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,2,6,2,7,2,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,2,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,7,2,6,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,2,7","0.146545901895,0.0662296339869,0.0507946759462,0.0413892492652,0.040636330843,0.0401577278972,0.0389325842261,0.035581920296,0.035581920296,0.0241201296449,0.0212204009295,0.0201756879687,0.0194228645414,0.0162011198699,0.0159262903035,0.0156364385039,0.015463905409,0.0137458229437,0.0137226115912,0.013532566838,0.013532566838,0.013532566838,0.013532566838,0.0130914095789,0.0117054088041,0.0110808145255,0.0108037004247,0.0103923613206,0.0103408014402,0.00943458918482,0.0091179702431,0.0091179702431,0.0091179702431,0.00910018291324,0.00827125459909,0.00827125459909,0.00827125459909,0.00826287083328,0.00703233201057,0.00698451371863,0.00647276407108,0.00614838069305,0.00614838069305,0.00614838069305,0.00614838069305,0.0061441687867,0.00574329914525,0.00536430208012,0.00535782473162,0.00535782473162,0.00488449307159,0.00485622044653,0.00485335709527,0.00474865129218,0.00408533820882,0.00396608421579,0.00383657077327,0.00325349671766,0.00270077539608,0.00270077539608,0.00270077539608,0.00253690127283,0.00206253281794,0.00159847084433,0.00159847084433,0.00116923532914"

so warm, savvy and personable and obviously totally representative of the once-again top-notch reputation this mart always had in the natural foods sector.  And of course, their to-die-for vegan bakery and prepared foods, excellent cornucopia of organic produce and well-stocked pharmacy )replete with its own nutritionist), and even their own cosmetics and  beauty section one flight up on the store's second floor plus a little cafe section where you can feast on the goodies you just bought in their main floor natural del -

If Wheatsville had an eau de toilette marketed after it, it would smell of veganism, hemp, coffee and Obama '08 posters. And maybe dirt. In retrospect, Wheatsville might have been my favorite place to shop in Austin and if I were reviewing them right now I would give them five stars.LifeThyme is the closest thing to Wheatsville outside of Morgantown's Brooklyn Natural. Being as I am a meat-eating moderate with a fondness for preservatives and not spending all of my disposable income on, say, organically harvested fruit, I almost never shop here. That was until my boss sent me hiking over to LifeThyme to pick up a very, very specific item. Almonds! Roasted unsalted almonds. I called in advance to arrange delivery but, as this is my boss's boss, I didn't want to risk messing up something as easy as almonds when I already mess up enough stuff as it is. Plus I just didn't want to buy $50 in almonds (the delivery minimum).Great store. Located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, it obviously does not smell of dirt. Also, it didn't have my refined-sugar-free granola of choice but it had several interesting alternatives. Great juice bar, too, and helpful staff. I like this place more than I liked Integral Yoga Foods, as that store very often did not have the things I needed when I needed them (although I believe they focus on more locally grown produce, which is a big plus).ps- The roasted unsalted almonds were everything my boss hoped they would be and more.

They have pretty much every item you need and often have really good sales, so even though I can't afford to do all my shopping there, I can usually find a bunch of stuff I need that happens to be on sale. My favorite part of the store is the hot/cold salad bar. They have a great selection of organic hot and cold dishes, many of which are vegan and some are raw. It's about $9.50/lb, but is half off after 9pm. I also love the vegan, organic bakery in the back. Considering how many veg/vegan places in NYC just order the same 7 Vegan Treats cakes, it's refreshing to have in-house-made cakes with interesting flavors like lemon poppyseed instead of just chocolate on top of chocolate. The upstairs seating area is really convenient and large enough that you can usually find a seat. I will say, however, I was pretty disappointed yesterday to see an entire shelf of Dr. Atkins books in their book section. Really? Dr. Atkins? Wasn't that craze over years ago?

Lighthouse,5539,145 Borinquen Pl,Brooklyn,11211.0,198910,"I've never written about any of my eating experiences until now. I'm not a food critic, nor am I a foodie, but I do know what tastes good and I do dabble in amateur cooking. One ingredient I recently discovered was Israeli Couscous and made numerous variations of it, including stuffing with figs and baking in Empire Apples. So when I read in L-Magazine that a new local restaurant opening in Brooklyn would be serving Israeli Couscous and lamb chops (another of my favorite meats) I couldn't wait. Unfortunately,  the experience was far from satisfying  and not only was it less than stellar but the most expensive eating experience I ever had that I'm compelled to write about. When we arrived the place was darkly lit and we were seated at a park table with benches. I had to use my Blackberry flashlight to read the menu, which was small offering  assorted raw oyster specials, fish, chicken and lamb. Since I was interest in the Couscous and lamb I thought I was going to try this combination but they didn't serve lamb with couscous and you cannot buy a side order of it. So I had to resort to the baked half chicken that came with couscous. Strike One. My girlfriend ordered the fish. We had a very long wait for the food and the din of the place with the park style bench and tables weren't meant for a romantic or discrete dining experience because we were joined by hipsters at our shared table.  Strike Two.  The half chicken and couscous was delivered in a cast-iron skillet together. I was excited but soon found the eating experience to be both disgusting and disappointing. The couscous was gloriously burnt and the chicken didn't have any noteworthy flavors.  I informed the waitress that the couscous was burnt and she stated that was how their customers liked it. I told her that the burnt couscous was very difficult to eat and I couldn't even chew it and she offered me a side order of couscous. I was relieved when she came back with a new plate of couscous and thought that this unbaked version was going to redeem the dining experience but to no avail. It didn't have any taste or flavors and was a pathetic rendition from even my amateur version.While I'm not discouraging anyone from going to this restaurant I hope this would prevent you from order the dish that was most disappointing to me. I would like to hear others customers responses. I hope the owners could take notice and address this problem.  This is also my fault for taking dining advice from L-Magazine, who seem to have a knack for hyping a place, only to be disappointed on numerous occasions and  now leading me to think that the restaurants are compensating them for making favorable recommendations.",1.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,11.8000001907,"food critic,foodie,L-Magazine,eating experiences,any,couscous,ingredient,Israeli Couscous,couscous,menu,cooking,variations,figs,chicken,waitress,fault,experience,restaurant opening,Empire Apples,chicken,eating experience,dish,couscous,combination,couscous,couscous,lamb chops,side order,meats,another,lamb,dining experience,experience,lamb,chicken,lamb,place,park table,tables,place,food,interest,chicken,benches,fish,table,Strike,fish,bench,wait,version,Couscous,oyster specials,Strike Two,dining experience,flashlight,girlfriend,din,hipsters,cast-iron skillet,Brooklyn,order,restaurant,version.,flavors,rendition,avail,taste,anyone,owners,recommendations,Blackberry,place,restaurants,dining advice,notice,customers,others,responses,problem,knack,occasions,side order,flavors,plate,customers","1,1,3,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,5,7,7,4,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,7,2,7,7,5,7,7,1,1,7,3,7,3,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,1","0.267829537392,0.198906168342,0.0491779223084,0.0410272404552,0.0341995693743,0.0200895089656,0.0154619766399,0.0147447027266,0.014715462923,0.0136215984821,0.0130241289735,0.0129576185718,0.0129576185718,0.0125597314909,0.00969139672816,0.0090205585584,0.0088757975027,0.00808796938509,0.00768274720758,0.00764721585438,0.00743519840762,0.00732752587646,0.00598812103271,0.00548432115465,0.00541710341349,0.00538659607992,0.00519321672618,0.0049572782591,0.00493668438867,0.00493668438867,0.00470056012273,0.00454497942701,0.00453215045854,0.00447588739917,0.00447588739917,0.00446832273155,0.00416684383526,0.00416684383526,0.00413041235879,0.00413041235879,0.00413041235879,0.00394543353468,0.0039022017736,0.0037900924217,0.0037826965563,0.0037798571866,0.00376563961618,0.00376109476201,0.00375695014372,0.00375695014372,0.00359581317753,0.00353071000427,0.00352616235614,0.00343456491828,0.00337631627917,0.00330966385081,0.00329075986519,0.00328713306226,0.00300806760788,0.00300219608471,0.00292342365719,0.00280589913018,0.00280589913018,0.00255208136514,0.00255208136514,0.0023789301049,0.00223426241428,0.00223281001672,0.00223281001672,0.00211983453482,0.00198849570006,0.00195943936706,0.00193923956249,0.00193923956249,0.00181960419286,0.00179768970702,0.00176580250263,0.00154483923689,0.00154483923689,0.00154392817058,0.00154305808246,0.00154305808246,0.00123228307348,0.00112242798787,0.00097980548162,0.000756921130233"

Lighthouse,5539,145 Borinquen Pl,Brooklyn,11211.0,198917,"I took my wife and her friend out for dinner last night (saturday, 03/12) to ""the lighthouse"". I'd been eagerly anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a couple of months as I watched them renovating. Well, it was worth the wait.       The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. The seating is communal wooden tables with benches, very clean and simple. The bar is a long swooping affair, with a nice wooden rail, the barback, custom shelving. And the light fixtures are wonderful brushed brass bowls. These elements all combine to produce a very welcoming comfortable atmosphere. Also the kitchen is open until midnight, good news for those of us that prefer to dine later.       Our server explained to us that the menu is constantly changing in order to reflect what is currently in season and available, demonstrating the restaurant's dedication to fresh, locally sourced ingredients. We started with a half dozen of oysters from the raw bar. (There were three varieties, we opted for two of each). The oysters were brought to us quickly and were amazing.      On the night that we visited there were four entrees and two salads offered. We skipped the salads and ordered three of the entrees, the fish of the day, the steak, and the New Zealand lamb chops. ""The Lighthouse"" has an open kitchen so we were able to see the cooks get to work immediately after receiving our ticket and before we could finish our first drinks our entrees were on the table. The three of us shared all three dishes and I'm able to report that they were all amazing. The steak was served with jalapeno peppers and my wife, who hates spicy food, began to cut into one of the peppers. I told her that she shouldn't eat the pepper because it was really spicy and she replied ""I know but everything is so good I want to try it.""

Lighthouse,5539,145 Borinquen Pl,Brooklyn,11211.0,198863,"I have eaten here a few times since it opened in March, and honestly, every day I wake up wondering when I am going to eat there again. Although the food is top-notch, it's the service that is the real highlight of dining there. Everybody on staff, the hosts, the bartenders, the guys at the raw bar, the cooks, looks so happy to be working there and to be serving you. They are very proud to share their product with you, and it shows.The first night I ate there I had the steak... and even though I don't have the paycheck to dine out every night, I came back the next night to have it again. It was just THAT good. The steak is served with a whole head of garlic (roasted to a point where it's liquid garlic gold) and a grilled pepper that has been marinated in some secret sauce (I honestly don't even care what its marinated in, the mystery is half of the culinary adventure). When these two are spread on top of the steak, it creates such a flavor explosion that I'm close to having a ""When Harry Met Sally"" dining situation.  I've also tried the lamb chops and ""loup de mer"" (French for branzino), which was so tasty and perfectly grilled that when the waiter came to take my plate, all that was leftover was the head and fin. The whole fish was also served on a bed of grilled leeks and golden beets, rounding out the meal.  The proportions are big and satisfying, and I always feel like I'm getting a big bang for my buck (I've never trusted a dainty chef, so having a 7 ft. man in charge of the menu must ensure a filling meal). There is also an entire pickle menu that I am so excited about! I can't even imagine what their Bloody Mary must taste like, I'll have to try soon since they just began brunch on the weekends. Their small plates are fantastic, including the Fish Plate, which was so clever and thoughtfully-executed. It was a perfect sampling of smoked trout (with pumpernickel), pickled herring (with a dollop of crème fraiche and boiled potato), and a small bed of boquerones (with juicy tomatoes that - despite it being March - they were still able to find delicious tomatoes). I should also mention the drink menu. I never order cocktails (unless it's a good Old Fashioned), but the cocktail menu here is creative and intriguing enough to tempt me into trying a few (some cocktails include lambic beer!). As for the wine selection, you really can't go wrong, and I think that dining at the Lighthouse has really turned me on to consistently ordering whites (their bottles range from sweet and light to robust and earthy), and the waiters/waitresses seem are good at recommending the right bottle for you. Writing this review has made me so hungry/thirsty for the Lighthouse, that I might have to go back there again tonight.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.40000000596,12.0,"highlight,guys,steak,French,mystery,dining,food,staff,hosts,bartenders,cooks,raw bar,pickle menu,paycheck,Everybody,product,point,pepper,flavor explosion,steak,sampling,plate,waiter,steak,menu,tomatoes,head,whites,garlic,head,meal,bed,fish,cocktail menu,leftover,filling meal,boquerones,gold,sauce,adventure,two,dining situation,top,fin,branzino,beets,leeks,lamb chops,cocktails,drink menu,big bang,buck,chef,man,charge,proportions,cocktails,Fish Plate,few,review,lambic beer,wine selection,waitresses,When Harry Met Sally,loup de mer,waiters,light,dining,Bloody Mary,bottles,bottle,Old Fashioned,Lighthouse,tomatoes,plates,bed,brunch,weekends,potato,crème fraiche,dollop,pickled herring,pumpernickel,trout","7,1,7,2,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,2,7,7,1,6,7,7,4,7,7,6,1,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,5,6,7,1,5,1,1,7,7,1,6,6,5,2,7,6,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.330267161131,0.0833565220237,0.0313705094159,0.0297457519919,0.0241817664355,0.0232706293464,0.0226847194135,0.018442183733,0.018442183733,0.018442183733,0.018442183733,0.018442183733,0.0180572345853,0.0178730133921,0.017533686012,0.0165684688836,0.0120170814916,0.0120170814916,0.0119936726987,0.00882717315108,0.00796215701848,0.0068789110519,0.00653906166553,0.00591883109882,0.00580336898565,0.00575811089948,0.00572607247159,0.00561894895509,0.00539419008419,0.00539419008419,0.00536654749885,0.00536654749885,0.00536654749885,0.00527927838266,0.00501006701961,0.00490446574986,0.00489991623908,0.00471963267773,0.00471963267773,0.00471963267773,0.00471042143181,0.00471042143181,0.00471042143181,0.00470245676115,0.00470245676115,0.00469544250518,0.00469544250518,0.00452702119946,0.00432119891047,0.00431388057768,0.00429108086973,0.00429108086973,0.00429108086973,0.00429108086973,0.00429108086973,0.00402756873518,0.00400475319475,0.00379050476477,0.00364248733968,0.00326376385055,0.0031868016813,0.00318435323425,0.00291472068056,0.00278872787021,0.00278401025571,0.00277057779022,0.00277057779022,0.00277057779022,0.00253448379226,0.00251988018863,0.00221976265311,0.00188638619147,0.0018496332923,0.00176669540815,0.00165285577532,0.00160017458256,0.0014026343124,0.0014026343124,0.00139989436138,0.00139989436138,0.00139989436138,0.00139989436138,0.00139989436138,0.00139989436138"

Lighthouse,5539,145 Borinquen Pl,Brooklyn,11211.0,88764,"Lighthouse is an absolute Brooklyn treasure. I have visited a number of times and have always been met with great service, exceptional food and an overall great dining experience. Although the place has a narrow build and fairly limited seating, the setup still allows for group hosting. I've had a number of dinners here. The menu is often small, with very specific items, but this really speaks to the nature of the place, focusing on a few key dishes, that they always nail and though small, there are still a variety of options. The menu is consistently changing but some of my favourite meals have been a roasted 1/2 chicken with a rice pilaf, served in a mid-sized cast-iron skillet. Another has actually been a sauteed curry seasoned broccolini side dish, and a roasted red potatoes side . . . . . also served in tiny cast iron skillets. I can assure it's pure coincidence that three of my key favourites are served in the same pan. The oysters remain consistent as well and are served with really well curated toppings.

Eventually the manager bought the four of us a round of drinks because it was taking so long, that was a night gesture. We didn't get seated until 10:10pm. By then we were pretty tired and it really put a damper on our night. When we finally got seated the waitress was rude and short with us. My friend asked if she could go over the menu for us (explain which plates were small plates etc.) and she said ""what do you want to know?"" That was the perfect opportunity for her to upsell us and she just avoided the question. For example the first four items on the menu are dips for bread, how are we supposed to know that? They were also out of burrata and ceviche, they had these items at 9pm when we arrived. That was a bummer, we were actually going to order both. I ordered the big salad and it was very good. My friends ordered oysters, octopus, the burger and chicken sandwich. All were decently good. Our waitress never really came to check on us during the meal.  We ran out of water twice and she was super behind each time.The one highlight of this place was the sweet hostess!! She was such a pleasure to work with and was soooo apologetic about the long wait. She checked in on us frequently, I should of got her name but she has long light brown hair. To recap: the atmosphere is very nice, drinks were good, food was good.

Stay away from the big salad.I came here for dinner with two friends and made a reservation for 7:15pm. Restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived but I saw a couple of empty tables so probably wouldn't be hard to walk in. Restaurant is cozy with candlit tables and big windows that open up to let in breezes on warm days. I came on a warm October night and it was a lovely ambiance.They have a solid cocktail list and a decent list of wines by the glass, with lots of organic wines. My friends and I shared three plates - corn with smoked labne, charred eggplant, and big salad - and two orders of bread. Unfortunately you get charged for bread, but its warm and crusty and very much worth the $4 you pay for 1/4 a loaf. The corn with smoked Labne was amazing, and the charred eggplant was a little mild, but still tasty. However, the big salad was just a big waste of money. It was more or less a lettuce salad with some chopped tomatoes and feta. I have gotten better salad as a side dish at strip mall sushi joints. We were disappointed but ordered a side of smoked labne to share since the big salad was utterly unfulfilling.The total came out to $40 a person, inclusive of tax and tip. Not bad given the multiple dishes we got to sample and the fact that we each had a drink.

We ordered a bunch of different things: ceviche, beef carpaccio, housemade sourdough, burrata, cured meats/cheese, oysters, the burger, and the chicken sandwich-- I know. A lot of food.The sourdough was great and I absolutely loved the carpaccio-- It is a generous portion and is sprinkled with sea salt. The burrata was fresh and interesting-- not like the store bought kind at all and comes with beautiful, bright heirloom tomatoes. What really brought me to lighthouse was the burger. However, the whole table agreed that we were a bigger fan of the chicken sandwich.

Lighthouse,5539,145 Borinquen Pl,Brooklyn,11211.0,198553,"I came here the other day after a Yelp search for ""oysters"" in my area...when Lighthouse came up, I jumped at the chance to visit because [full disclosure] I knew the owner/chef Nick and had been meaning to visit for ages. I can honestly say, I think this is the best restaurant experience I've had in years.I brought a couple friends + the boyfriend, and we started off with a bottle of wine and some oysters. I have minimal oyster knowledge, but my favorites are ""kumamotos"" and they made up half of our dozen - delicious! I especially loved their Abuela sauce, which is sortof a spicy version of cocktail sauce. I confess, I spooned up the rest of the sauce just to eat by itself once the oysters were gone. They also make a kind of Mexican bloody mary with the Abuela sauce, which my friend had and it was also delicious.Nick was kind enough to send us out some tuna tartare, which came in small tasty chunks with lovely texture, and full of black sesame seeds and other goodies. Yum!The bf and I split a Green salad, a flank steak skewer, and the mujadarra - absolutely amazing. Steak was perfectly done and had that lovely wood-fire taste to it, and came with a yogurt dip and some sort of cabbage salad. The mujadarra: I didn't know rice and lentils could be so delightful. I think it was the caramelized onions + yogurt that did the trick...The bf also had a Manhattan, which came well-boozed and with some sort of lovely, liquor-soaked preserved cherries - NOT those awful maraschinos. I don't love Manhattans, but I made him let me try it and I could tell it was probably delicious to him.My friend had the fish of the day, which I think was a Bronzini of some sort. It came whole on top of sauteed/roasted/somethingorother savory vegetables like onions and fennel. I was staring at it the whole time with jealousy, but I didn't end up getting a taste. Next time!The place was lovely, which I think added to our falling-in-love with it. The tables have benches (something I always love), and the space is wide open with huge floor-to-ceiling windows. I know the owners themselves were doing the renovations of the place for months, and worked really hard basically tearing the place apart and re-doing it -- it shows. I'd recommend it as a great easy-going date spot, super-great to take friends, absolutely delicious food, and don't miss the drinks -- bartenders got skillz!",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.5,12.6000003815,"Nick,Abuela sauce,restaurant experience,favorites,oysters,area,chance,ages,search,disclosure,Lighthouse,Yelp,kind,Manhattans,sauce,onions,tuna tartare,friends,place,oysters,Steak,wine,bottle,boyfriend,half,oyster knowledge,friend,cocktail sauce,sauce,oysters,sort,rest,sort,bf,Green salad,mujadarra,wood-fire taste,lentils,bf,cabbage salad,mujadarra,yogurt,place,sesame seeds,texture,bloody mary,chunks,goodies,flank steak skewer,yogurt dip,rice,trick,cherries,maraschinos,owners,space,taste,something,fish,friends,jealousy,Abuela,benches,windows,tables,bartenders,Mexican,place,renovations,drinks,food,date spot,friend,sort,skillz,onions,fennel,sauteed,vegetables,top,Bronzini,him.My","1,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,4,4,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,6,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1","0.103991903365,0.0940213352442,0.0704327523708,0.0668129697442,0.0520234368742,0.0385978743434,0.0385978743434,0.0385978743434,0.0385978743434,0.0258098356426,0.0253744218498,0.0229407418519,0.0174600742757,0.0165331959724,0.016149867326,0.0132281025872,0.0132228750736,0.0125893680379,0.00981985684484,0.00953102484345,0.00875969603658,0.00704945670441,0.00704945670441,0.00704945670441,0.0070133516565,0.0070133516565,0.0067630475387,0.0063807182014,0.00636270921677,0.00636270921677,0.00587677583098,0.00537738250569,0.00536286178976,0.00535450689495,0.00535450689495,0.00535450689495,0.0053454558365,0.00523420935497,0.0051969862543,0.00489175366238,0.00488445814699,0.00487794121727,0.0047645107843,0.00469412142411,0.00469412142411,0.00469412142411,0.00469412142411,0.00469412142411,0.00468496093526,0.00467703957111,0.0042736181058,0.00426791515201,0.00426791515201,0.00426791515201,0.0039590052329,0.00388555042446,0.00363240856677,0.00362582551315,0.00356084527448,0.00345339439809,0.00317800813355,0.0031765892636,0.00317224767059,0.00317224767059,0.00305386050604,0.00282567786053,0.00277916551568,0.00275780633092,0.00219441251829,0.00219272612594,0.00219272612594,0.00219272612594,0.001889377716,0.00175534759182,0.00161732069682,0.00159471889492,0.00139512610622,0.00139512610622,0.00139512610622,0.00139512610622,0.000880717532709,0.000826588657219"

By the time my burger arrived they already were long past their meals. They clearly realized that they forgot about my order by the time the other ones were ready. We noticed BTW that the same thing happened at other tables. So there's a clear problem with meal tracking and general organization.The waiters were nice, but there was a strong feeling that there was not enough of them. Between ordering meals, drinks, check or just about anything it took them usually at least 15 minutes to approach us. We wound up spending much more time there then we expected for a meal and 2 drinks.The only reason I'm considering going back there is because the burger was so good.

Went here on a Saturday night in the early evening and the place was empty.  The bartender was reasonably friendly and offered to make a drink that wasn't on the menu.  The only problem was that he failed terribly at making the drink, never asked how it tasted, and then just pretended like everything was okay as the drink he prepared sat on the counter the whole night without being consumed.  The drink was included in our bill at the end of the night.As for the food, the spectrum is from ""meh"" to ""hell no"" and really doesn't deserve any mention.  But I have to ask how Lighthouse can serve oysters with no horseradish in the entire restaurant.  None.  They actually offered to bring me bloody mary mix instead, because that was the only horseradish available in the restaurant.  For one, no thanks.  Two, that also tells me to never come back for the bloody mary, because the mix is obviously not made in house.  The pico de gallo-like oyster sauce I had two years ago that I loved was replaced by some sort of chipotle smoke flavor sauce and another type of salsa that tasted like it came from a bottle.  So I ate my oysters with just the lemon juice.  For what it's worth, the oysters are still decent.Waitstaff were ghosts and I'm not certain if the guy serving me food had ever worked in a restaurant before.Here's the thing, Lighthouse:  You're not in a heavy pedestrian traffic area, and there are a million other restaurants in Williamsburg that we can go to.  Soooooo, you need to separate yourself from the others, and the way to do that is to offer good food and solid service.  It really is that easy.  No rocket science is involved.  So trash those disgusting moody blue brussel sprouts and the throwaway pieces of chicken you put on the chicken skewer, and then start over again.  Go back to making quality food with quality ingredients.  Get some decent waitstaff, put in a heater (because for fuck's sake it's 30 degrees in there), and go buy some horseradish for those oysters.  If you're still around in 6 months I'll give you another try.",2.0 star rating,"Washington, DC",3,1,-0.10000000149,8.80000019073,"bartender,drink,bloody mary mix,things,trip,place,problem,type,menu,Lighthouse,drink,drink,drink,everything,oysters,counter,bill,end,heater,food,restaurant,restaurant,mix,oysters,horseradish,spectrum,oysters,Lighthouse,bloody mary,oyster sauce,night.As,chipotle smoke flavor sauce,mention,None,thanks,house,pico de,food,bottle,salsa,sort,lemon juice,ghosts,way,food,chicken,horseradish,waitstaff,service,rocket science,brussel sprouts,pieces,chicken skewer,oysters,ingredients,sake,fuck,Waitstaff,food,restaurant,thing,restaurants,try,guy,pedestrian traffic area,others,Williamsburg","1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,7,3,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,2,7,1,2,1,2","0.293624639511,0.0744416415691,0.064052157104,0.058054421097,0.0496396459639,0.0283356159925,0.027324417606,0.0267875436693,0.0236353669316,0.0217098556459,0.0156926847994,0.0121881775558,0.0121538415551,0.010764378123,0.00915023777634,0.0090170763433,0.00899164937437,0.00899164937437,0.00838389340788,0.00821094866842,0.00819202139974,0.00816224422306,0.00790752191097,0.00789147242904,0.00761192617938,0.00743670063093,0.00739992177114,0.00738874264061,0.00687948288396,0.00687118526548,0.0066923671402,0.00628828397021,0.00607275217772,0.00604692660272,0.00602770876139,0.00601967005059,0.00601240759715,0.00554298330098,0.00550223886967,0.00550223886967,0.00550223886967,0.00549617689103,0.00549060665071,0.00501993205398,0.00492993881926,0.00467299995944,0.00424225209281,0.00416343938559,0.00409869337454,0.00409176293761,0.00408862065524,0.00408862065524,0.00408862065524,0.00406035874039,0.00282887346111,0.002826935146,0.002826935146,0.00271872617304,0.00256084511057,0.00243420270272,0.00239496934228,0.00228466419503,0.00200608512387,0.00182247289922,0.00179950601887,0.00179781555198,0.00106506503653"

Its sweet/salty/spicy combination was just what I was looking for.  About 5 mins of being engrossed in my meal and I realized I hadn't taken a pic. (Maybe I should have taken a pic of the bones to accentuate how good it was.). Only downside was that like most places they give you more rice than veggies and I love veggies.

Likkle More Jerk,5540,445 Albee Square W,Brooklyn,11201.0,8603,"Went with the classic jerk chicken, and the waffles. You don't see too many jerk chicken places doing waffles, so I was hesitant, but intrigued. They're making the waffles fresh right there, I saw it. Yet somehow what comes out is a flacid waffle, that tastes very reminiscent of the always disappointing, Eggo waffle. Also, no special syrup or dipping sauce here, just some very generic, store bought maple syrup. Waffles are easily a weak 2 stars.But onto the jerk chicken, it would be preposterous to judge a jerk place based on their waffles. Surely the chicken would shine through, and redeem for the poor waffle, right? Ah, not so much. Definitely nothing special about the chicken. It was cooked alright, though the leg was a little on the dry side. The seasoning was a little weak.

Lili Chinese Restaurants,5542,8306 Grand Ave,Elmhurst,11373.0,142544,I enjoy their super fast delivery along with their fried rice.   Very important since it's apart of most dishes you purchase.   I'm originally from Long Island and have been through a slew of chinese restaurants and found the fried rice to be quite unenjoyable..   I  LOVE lili's..   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I call sometimes and I've had my order slightly backwards..   While I asked for chicken and broccoli combo with more fried rice and less chicken and broccoli they had it wrong.   Only problem one time!!   So thumbs up!   Keep on cooking your delicious fried rice that enhances just about all dishes!!   And customers beware of the speedy delivery.    Sometimes your not prepared with your money and feel as though you just got off the phone!   ***** for delivery!!

Lili Chinese Restaurants,5542,8306 Grand Ave,Elmhurst,11373.0,32642,"This Chinese restaurant is one of the better Chinese American take-out places available in the area. The only other place that is acceptable is probably Halal Kitchen which is a little further back into Maspeth.There isn't too much to say in terms of restaurant decor, it is a pretty run down looking Chinese take-out place which is manned by two or three people. The woman who works there isnt the friendliest but again she mans that station from 9am till 11pm so who can blame her.The only reason for this review is because when you want Chinese-takeout this is one of the best places to head to and this is because the food is actually okay.1. Beef/Chicken and Broccoli - Always excellent with a thick brown sauce with broccoli that is never over cooked or undercooked2. Chow Fun - Unlike many other places the Chow Fun here doesn't break apart and isnt over cooked; moreover they will always make alterations for you such as no veggies and no bean sprouts3. General Tsao - The chicken here is not the best as they use small pieces of chicken which are really breaded. They are almost like popcorn chicken with general tsao sauce. 4. Wonton Soup - Really thick skinned wontons in the regular glowing yellow broth; not worth your time.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,61,"KenScale: 8.0/10No restaurant in New York City is hotter than Lilia in Williamsburg at the moment. Headed by star chef Missy Robbins, who was last seen at A Voce in Columbus Circle and Flatiron, Lilia has so many things you would love if you're looking for a great neighborhood place. I think the restaurant's vision of itself has changed over time following glowing reviews; while it probably intended to be more of a neighborhood favorite for Brooklynites, it has become a destination dining place for people from all over the city, including Manhattan. I mean, you can't blame them. With a chic and inviting décor that screams a hang-out place for all the cool kids in the city, plus celebrity chef's comeback, it just sounds too good to be true. After making multiple futile efforts to get reservations, I just decided to try for walk-ins and hope for the best. When my dining party of four arrived at slightly after 6 p.m., we were quoted a wait time of 1.5-2 hours, and at the bar area (not at one of the tables since they were all fully booked). Since all of us had late lunches, we were fine with waiting at a nearby café and killing time. After showing up 2 hours later, we were stuck in the bar adjacent to the dining space, patiently waiting our turn. We finally got seated slightly before 9 p.m.! I think Lilia probably set my all-time records for a restaurant wait. They'd better be worth it and be as good as what all the critics are saying, I thought while looking across the table where chef Robbins was standing at the kitchen directly all the staffs there. I haven't been to A Voce before, so I really didn't know what to expect from chef Robbins' kitchen. I'm all for a rich and flavorful Italian meal, but I also try to avoid heavy salt intake. Overall, I felt the food from Lilia could've toned down a little in the seasoning department, starting with cacao e pepe frittelle (yes, think cacao e pepe in fried donuts), which could've been a marvelous snack had the flavor been not too aggressive. On the other hand, I loved the fresh verdure crude, warm anchovy and garlic salad with bagna cauda that was an excellent start to the meal. There are some small seafood appetizers at Lilia, and you should definitely try at least a dish or two. I was a fan of cured sardines with capers and dill that had the right amount of salt in it, and grilled clams with Calabrian chilies and breadcrumbs were also quite delicious. I had the highest expectations for chef Robbins' pastas, which are nothing fancy like at other places like Marea but seem to really emphasize the quality of ingredients and simple elegance. All the dishes that I had tried were good, but again this is where I wished the seasoning were slightly moderated. I enjoyed the rustic touch of mafaldini with pink pepper corn and parmigiano reggiano, and the aromatic flavor of sheeps milk filled agnolotti with saffron, dried tomato and honey was also something to remember. Both dishes, however, felt a little too aggressive in seasoning and had I not shared each with three other dining companion, I wasn't sure if I could've finished each by myself. Surprisingly, ricotta gnocchi with broccoli pesto and basil had more balance in flavor. Of the entrée dishes, we shared grilled branzino with salsa verde, and I really liked the simple touch of well-cooked branzino that worked quite harmoniously with salsa verde. For desserts, olive oil cake with blood oranges, grappas and whipped cream seems to be the safe choice, but I also really liked the soft serves, particularly the vanilla one that had lemony walnuts, arametti cookies, sprinkles and chocolate stracci for toppings. It could've been a perfect antidote if you had dined at the restaurant on a hot summer day.As mentioned above, getting a reservation at Lilia is going to be a Herculean task. The best way is to just get there when the restaurant opens up at 5:30 p.m. and hope for the best on walk-in spaces, including outdoor tables that the restaurant has set aside (in that regard, showing up in smaller groups would certainly help). The restaurant has a full bar, and I really enjoyed some of the Italian wine selections that I had by the glass. You will love the atmosphere of the restaurant, which has a cozy vibe that makes you feel you belong in the place where all the handsome people hang out.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,67716,"Oh lawd, lawd have mercy. I am clutching my pearls with how surprisingly delicious dinner was.I came here tonight with a fellow foodie friend; insistent that I eat here before Pete Well's reviews it for the NYT and it becomes nigh impossible to get a reservation more so than it already is. For the next few weeks out the only reservations available are 6pm or 10pm.The space is palatial compared to most restaurants in Williamsburg. It's open, white, high ceilings and surrounded by windows that will bathe the restaurant in beautiful light during the day. They also have a coat check! I could literally write a three-page essay on why I dislike hooks, winter coats, and the lack of coat checks in this city.My friend and I are promptly seated, going back and forth on what to order. I spend some time debating whether or not I need a proper protein because the pasta I want really doesn't have any but our list was getting rather long so I'll make do with a carb-heavy unbalanced dinner for the evening. The menu doesn't actually look all that interesting, I picked this place because I had heard quite a bit about the head chef, Missy Robbins (of Spiaggia and A Voce) but Italian food with scallops, mushroom, clams, lamb chops, and branzino on the menu doesn't necessarily excite me. Oh great, branzino on another New York menu? Of the 30,000 fish species you couldn't pick something interesting? But holy hell, the blasé sounding dishes I had were executed to perfection/near-perfection.First up for starters we order the grilled clams with calabrian chili & bread crumbs ($16), the grilled bread with chestnut crema and pancetta ($8), and the grilled mushrooms with almonds, garlic and pepper ($14). In order those were my favorites. I would pass on the mushrooms, they were nice but not very interesting. The grilled clams had a very subtle heat to them and the bread crumbs stayed crunchy throughout. Yay for no soggy drenched bready clams!For our pastas we ordered the beautiful malfadini with peppercorns & cheese ($18) and sheepsmilk cheese agnolotti with saffron, tomato, and honey ($22). This is where it gets really good, let's skip the agnolotti, it was good and maybe I would've paid more attention to it if I hadn't tried the malfadini first which captured my heart instantaneously. I fell in love with my eyes and then fell in love once more once it hit my lips. I swear, before tonight you could not convince me that a simple plain pasta barely dressed but with a mere kiss of cheese and pepper could taste so heavenly -- if we were discussing Greek mythos, Missy Robbin's malfadini was the ambrosia eaten by the waywardly deities. But could you expect anything less from a chef who is one of 10 women to hold a Michelin star?Now we move along to the desserts. I order the olive oil cake with whipped cream ($8) and the double chocolate torte ($8). To be quite frank, I passed on the torte. It was a bit too dark and bitter for my tastes. The olive oil cake was lovely, but I've had better. Total bill sans imbibing (with tax) came out to be $102.34. Not bad at all. The service was exceptional too.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,65510,"This restaurant is dangerous - I licked every plate clean. Housed in a former auto body shop, Lilia's is dishing out fresh pastas and lots of seafood dishes although there is meat in the pasta dishes and a couple of meat entrees too. Anyway on to the goodies. There's a starter called Bagna Cauda, which is basically a plate of vegetables served with a contraption with a flame beneath a cup holding a warm anchovy and garlic sauce for dipping. It is excellent. Another great starter is the grilled scallops with walnuts, yogurt, and marjoram which adds a nice sweet unfamiliar but welcomed flavor.We ordered two pasta dishes - one which was a special with bottarga and the other which is from the menu - Pappardelle, Veal Bolognese, Porcini, NutmegBoth were excellent. I'm not sure if my minimal consumption of starches makes me appreciate carbs when I do eat them, but the pastas were light and tasty. By the way, anything with bottarga is a must-have in my book. We also got the Black Bass entree with Salsa Verde and Coal Roasted Potatoes. The dish looked strange. The fish was covered in the salsa verde I couldn't see the fish and actually forgot what I ordered. The presentation was off-putting so I didn't take a picture but after digging into it, I was floored. What a delicate piece of fish, firm yet light. The potato was round and flat almost like a disc at the bottom of the dish. Usually I stop eating potatoes that are not sweet potatoes after a few bites but I could not stop eating this. I knew for sure this place is a keeper. I'm already planning my next visit. By the way the desserts are ok. I tried the olive oil cake and the chocolate flourless cake. I know Pete Wells and many others recommend the olive oil cake. I appreciate all foods and will try anything but my heart for sweets still belongs to chocolate and I preferred the chocolate over the olive oil cake. The olive oil cake was a little too subtle to satisfy any sweet tooth craving. Even the accompaniment of figs didn't help.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,35965,"Having been a regular at A Voce and read the terrific reviews of this restaurant I made great effort to secure a reservation -- which wasn't easy -- at Lilia.  After all I was a fan of Missy Robbins the restaurant's chief.  Lilia is not A Voce.  It is a loud somewhat cramped, simple restaurant in Williamsburg filled with millennials, but the restaurant had received three stars by the New York Times so I was expecting a exceptional meal.  When we arrived we were told our table would be ready ""in a few minutes.""  It was ready 30 minutes later.I wish I could say the wait was worth it.  The Little Gem Salad was closer to romaine with a dressing high in vinegar content with hard bread crumbs that that tasted like large grains of sand.  No small tasty croutons on butter like lettuce. But then everyone talks glowingly about the pastas.  The NYT called the gnocchi:   ""tender cheese dumplings that seem to be held together by nothing but the force of Ms. Robbins's will.""  Since gnocchi is among my favorite dishes, I had to try it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Not very tender and certainly not supple as great gnocchi is.  As for the chocolate dessert.  It was more like a dried out cake with no rich chocolate taste that one might expect.  The bread by the way, was also dried out as if it were day old.  The best part of the meal was the complimentary cup of ice cream given for the half hour wait.My husband fared better. He loved his fennel salad and his black bass with saved the evening.  So order wisely if you go, and be prepared to wait for your table.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",2,0,0.0,8.69999980927,"chief,reservation,reviews,restaurant,Lilia,New York Times,restaurant,effort,regular,A Voce,Missy Robbins,fan,Little Gem Salad,husband,nothing,part,vinegar content,restaurant,restaurant,chocolate taste,stars,millennials,everyone,table,gnocchi,wait,meal,Voce,bread,gnocchi,will,Williamsburg,sand,grains,bread crumbs,romaine,croutons,butter,lettuce,pastas,force,tender cheese dumplings,dishes,meal,way,ice cream,fennel salad,table,bass,gnocchi,wait.My,truth,chocolate dessert,cake","1,7,5,2,1,3,2,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,1,7,7,7,7,1,6,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.216200336814,0.120028473437,0.0551152974367,0.0549951791763,0.0444643981755,0.043306235224,0.0430029779673,0.0409197472036,0.0331016257405,0.0278500188142,0.0259090811014,0.023399984464,0.0208319760859,0.0180785357952,0.0173274427652,0.0145128676668,0.0127174323425,0.0101675102487,0.0100788911805,0.00990974716842,0.00764960236847,0.00745857553557,0.0071981032379,0.00702985329553,0.00700245751068,0.00683846464381,0.00661767274141,0.0062861237675,0.00601243600249,0.00572612695396,0.00520890252665,0.00505084125325,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.0050030364655,0.00499458611012,0.00499458611012,0.00499458611012,0.00456417072564,0.0045580859296,0.0045580859296,0.00455258833244,0.00386674120091,0.0033859545365,0.00338335498236,0.00277951732278,0.00267399405129,0.00234115659259,0.00229262141511,0.00158533081412,0.00149090087507,0.0014879895607,0.00148668838665"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,49015,"Pasta done perfectly!In my opinion definitely deserving of all the accolades it's gotten. Reservations through Resy were a cinch, and probably not as hard to come by now these days compared to when the place first opened. The space itself is gorgeous and warm - actually taking over the space of an old auto shop. Quite casual and unpretentious. Option to sit outdoors along the street is nice too (especially because sometimes it gets really, really hot inside).Quick rundown of the food that we got: cacio e pepe fritter was good, but wasn't mind blowing - I think partly because my expectations were so high after everyone mentioning it in their reviews. Whole artichoke was excellent - served open faced with this hot/garlicky oil that was super delicious. Agnolotti - omg, that cheese filling was out of this world! Mafaldini was exceptional - the pasta had the perfect texture/bite and that peppery goodness...wow (probably our favorite of the night). Rigatoni was very good, but I think was not as memorable as the agnolotti and mafaldini.Only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me was the service. It was passable, but our waiter seemed really aloof/disinterested and never smiled the entire time....then again, it was pretty late in the day so he could have been worn out. Anyhow, didn't really detract too much from the whole experience though.Lilia is a must try for anyone who loves all things pasta!",4.0 star rating,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.40000000596,7.5,"Pasta,agnolotti,opinion,accolades,artichoke,cinch,place,oil,Resy,space,space,food,Option,anyone,Reservations,auto shop,waiter,expectations,pasta,fritter,Agnolotti - omg,everyone,reviews,rundown,street,cheese filling,world,texture/bite,goodness,Mafaldini,pasta,cacio e pepe,experience,things,thing,Lilia,favorite,stars,Rigatoni","7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,1,7,3,1,7,7,1,7,1,5,7,2,4,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7","0.115995779634,0.102937459946,0.0988114029169,0.0988114029169,0.0520052015781,0.0476030558348,0.0436059013009,0.0337989628315,0.0283204726875,0.02544112131,0.0244972873479,0.0229292158037,0.0221322700381,0.021859543398,0.0207575839013,0.0182030014694,0.0167900510132,0.0154148321599,0.0148798106238,0.014590847306,0.0132986223325,0.0122240455821,0.0122240455821,0.0122240455821,0.0122240455821,0.0111407870427,0.0111407870427,0.0111219836399,0.0111219836399,0.00786777213216,0.00748431030661,0.00724338646978,0.0065540894866,0.0065540894866,0.00416407175362,0.00415915204212,0.00364866759628,0.00364322401583,0.00257568131201"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,7216,"One of the best meals, I've had in a very long time. This place deserves stars. The clams, cacio pepe fritelle, mafaldini, and fettucine were all excellent. Came as a walk-in for 2 Friday night around 9 and they only had outdoor tables available. It was a little chilly, but they'd thought of this in advance and provided blankets to my girlfriend and myself. The somm was friendly and accommodating. Within minutes of ordering the clams were out, within minutes of that our table was full as we'd ordered the fritelle previously noted and the cauliflower. The cauliflower was good, but not exceptional. The fritelle were soft, doughy, and cheesy like a mix between a zeppole and gougeres. The clams were unbelievably flavorful. The calabrian chilies and the toasted bread crumbs made the dish balanced flavor-wise and texturally.Our entrees were great as well, though the mafaldini was not as hot temperature-wise as we would have liked. It wasn't cold, but it seemed it may have taken a little longer than it should have to get to our table. Texturally it was spot on however. The fettucine sausage dish was a standout. I've eaten many, many ragus/bolognese style dishes in my life and this one was one of the best I've ever had. The lamb sausage and the fennel seed lent a nice combination of flavors that was subtle but different than your standard meat-based sauce, and we kept going back for more even after we'd both admitted we were full.

It's cooked al dente and all you could really taste was the pink peppercorns.

I take half and half in my coffee, so she poored me some milk and cream to get me that half and half experience. Very sweet indeed. Also, this was the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever had, hands down. I returned once more on our last day and picked up 6 cookies to take back with me to SF.

I worked FOH in restaurants in Manhattan for two years and can tell you if she worked with any of my former managers there would be some serious discussions about the attitude issues. Being snotty to guests is not ""in""-- not even in scene-y Williamsburg. I've experienced warmer hospitality at the IHOP.She must think she's working the velvet rope at Bagatelle. Honey, you're at an Italian restaurant in Williamsburg at 6pm on a Monday. Take a chill pill.We politely inquire about seating and make it clear we'll be flexible re: bar vs dining room. She abruptly retorts the same regurgitated canned response I overheard her say to the party in front of us: the dining room fully booked out three days ago, and the wait for dinner at the bar is 1.5 to 1.75 hours. *looks around, sees 10 open tables*Lol. Fine. But there's a more hospitable way to tell someone there's almost a two hour wait early on a Monday night.My friend and I recommend Lilia modify their policy so that you can only reserve a table in the dining room and the bar should be fully first come first serve only. Any other way seriously deters patrons. I don't know many people willing to wait almost 2 hours early on a Monday. It's right after work and we're starving.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198811,"We wanted to like Lilia more, But, sadly it did not live up to the hype. The hosts were quite full of themselves (see saga below) and while the sauces were excellent, our appetizer and both pastas were disappointingly under-cooked.HOSTING - We called in advance and were politely informed that they were booked. But, then kindly told that since is was early and they were not yet crowded, if we came over quickly, we could get a table. But when we arrived in less the 10 minutes, the hosts were utterly aloof and haughty. They had the air of security guards ferreting out a potential terrorist. When we asked for a table, they gave us this incredulous gasp and stated, ""You mean, you DON'T have reservations!?!"" We looked at each other in horror, what happened to the sweet person on the phone that had just urged us minutes earlier to race over? To break this awkward pregnant pause, I leaned over and revealed the fact that we had just called, and were encouraged to stop by. ""Well...? The lead host responded icily. ""All we can do is seat out you OUTSIDE!"" and pointed back behind us as if we would be sitting on the steps with the other riff raff.As it turned out, the outside cafe tables were much more relaxed than the stuffiness inside. Our server was pleasant, lighthearted, and fairly attentive. But there were problems throughout the rest of our meal. And, we sadly experienced a lot of ""BUTS""...BEER - a nice selection, BUT both our choices were flat as a pancake. So, we switched to wine.CAULIFLOWER - the spicy Soppressata pesto sauce was wonderful. The pretty tri-colorful cauliflower looked great, BUT was significantly under-cooked and overly crunchy. Maybe a cleaver could have worked to get thru the stalks, but not our knives. The sauce was quite tasty, BUT was thin and didn't stick to the cauliflower. So we order some bread.BREAD - it would have soaked up the Cauliflower sauce nicely, BUT it was totally burned on the hidden underside of each piece (did the kitchen really think we wouldn't notice the taste of ash when we took a bite!?!) So we pulled apart the edible half, and left the burnt bones.(BTW - the server never commented/apologized/acknowledged on plate of ""blacked charcoal"" sitting off to the side or the 1/2 full bowl of Cauliflower chunky stalks when he cleared the plates. Oh well.)PASTA #1 (Corzetti, Chanterelles, Savory, Aged Goat Cheese)Simply wonderful Chanterelle mushroom sauce that was truly finger-lickin' good. BUT, the Corzetti pasta, which were like flat disks of pasta dough cut with a juice glass, were sadly less than al dente, and had the taste of raw dough.PASTA #2 (Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey)Great combination of unique flavors in the filling, BUT the edges of the Agnolotti that were pinched-closed were quite underdone and hard. Also, the flavor of ""saffron"" was a merely an illusion and barely discernible. We thought it to be a faux saffron that gave color, and no real flavor.Our experience was OK.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,89529,"Made this reservation ONE MONTH in advance for a 10PM Saturday night dinner (crazy right?) but DAMN was it worth it. One of the better Italian restaurants I have dined at and right up there with L'Artusi for me. We started off with an order of the Cacio E Pepe Fritelle and the Whole Artichoke which was phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend these dishes, especially the artichoke. Seasoned artichoke leaves with excellent flavor and a broth to dip them in. Great for 2-3 people. As for mains we went with an order of the Rigatoni Diavola, Mafaldini and Futtucine which were each very delicious. If you can only order one, go with the Mafaldini. As for dessert, we went with the chocolate gelato and olive oil cake - each superb.Unfortunately, our service was quite poor, having a miserable and completely disinterested server, who rudely told us we did not order enough, yet we left completely stuffed. I am optimistic this was just one of the servers and not the norm, but the food overshadowed it anyway.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,8409,"Very good pasta with unique flavors.  THE WAIT: My friend got at 5:23pm on a Monday. She was first in line for the wait. When they opened at 5:30pm, we were initially told they were completely booked inside for the evening but could sit outside. That didn't sound pleasing in the 90-degree heat wave. Just a minute later, they told us they did have a table, but we had to be done by 7pm. That worked for us! THE SERVICE: Very friendly and personable. THE COST: $46 total including tax/tip. I split 3 starters, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts with three other people. Very reasonable for the quality!  APERATIVI SALATI (Cocktail snacks)* Fritelle ($7) - 4.5 starsVery cheesy, can smell it immediately! Filling gooey & melty. Great slight crisp to the shell. Only comes with three; you cannot add a single fritelle but would have to order two entire dishes. ANTIPASTI (To start)* Cauliflower ($14) - 3.5 starsA bit underdone for me. Quality ingredients. Spicy wasn't amazing, quite oily on bottom.  PESCI PICCOLI, ECC. (Little fish, etc.)* Cauliflower ($14) - 3.5 starsA bit underdone for me. Quality ingredients. The spicy flavor wasn't amazing with the cauliflower, and this had a layer of oil on the bottom of the dish.  PRIMI (Pasta)* Mafaldini ($19) - 4 starsVery al dente, surprisingly strong black pepper flavor. I liked the texture; it was very interesting to chew on. * Fettuccine, spicy lamb sausage ($19) - 3.5 starsReally nicely done, but I could taste caraway seeds - that overwhelmed the flavor too much for me. This was one of my friends' favorites.  * Ricotta Gnocchi, broccoli pesto ($19) - 3.5 starsSuper soft gnocchi! However the pesto flavor was a bit off too me. My friends really liked this, it was one of their favorites. * Agnolotti, sheeps milk cheese filling ($23) - 4 starsReally nice, lightly sweet filling.  GELATO & CONDIMENTI (Soft serve)* Vanilla soft serve ($8) - 4 starsGreat flavor, loved the chocolate stracci topping best. Melts quickly, gets watery! The menu lists four toppings, but you can actually only have three. DOLCI (Sweets)* Olive oil cake ($9) - 3.5 starsThe whipped cream was fantastic. The cake was moist but a little hard.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,57445,"I had read about this place having an amazing chef, so during one of my recent trips back to NY, I figured I'd try getting a reservation.  This place opens up their books a month in advance at midnight, and despite me logging on at 12:05 am, I still couldn't grab a Saturday reservation for two!  I'm convinced that they have more tables for larger parties, but who really knows how these games work.  Anyway, I had heard that they have 12 bar seats on a first come first serve basis at 5:30 pm when they open, so we figured we'd press our luck.  We were in the area, and ended up stopping by around 4:30 to inquire about the available bar seats or if a line had started (it hadn't yet), but the head of the house was so gracious that she checked the schedule and was able to get us a remaining table for when they opened!  Excellent service!!Whew...if you're still reading and haven't fallen asleep yet, I'll move quickly on to the space, service, and food.  The decor is minimalist but didn't feel pretentious.  The staff was ridiculously amazing.  We were always promptly tended to and the servers were very helpful.  The service alone warrants 4 stars.  Moving on to the food, I wished everything we ate was the most delicious thing (is that even possible), but we were a little underwhelmed.  Nothing was bad, but the cacio e pepe fritelle, grilled scallops, and mozzarella with garlic bread were just okay.  I was a little disappointed with the mafaldini also, which I had heard was amazing.  I will say though that the standout of the meal was the Parmigiano-filled tortellini!  It was served in in a bowl with brodo, and the pasta exploded with flavor--definitely a must order!  All things we ordered were relatively reasonably priced, ranging from around $8 to low $20s from what I remember.Overall, the setting and food were good, but pretty much what I had expected.  The service though was outstanding.  I'd be interested to return and try a few other pasta or main dishes to see if anything measures up to that gnocchi!",4.0 star rating,"Boston, MA",3,1,0.40000000596,10.6999998093,"place,reservation,place,chef,one,trips,books,NY,advance,everything,line,tortellini,bar seats,reservation,tables,basis,games,parties,table,service,service,service,food,head,bar seats,food,decor,staff,luck,house,area,space,stars,pasta,schedule,service,things,mafaldini,meal,must order,flavor,brodo,bowl,anything,food,servers,pasta,setting,dishes,gnocchi,Parmigiano,Nothing,underwhelmed,garlic bread,mozzarella,scallops,cacio e pepe,fritelle","7,7,7,1,4,4,5,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,6,7,7,1,1","0.0865618139505,0.0761492848396,0.0761492848396,0.0667718276381,0.0667718276381,0.0667718276381,0.0653754621744,0.0397786647081,0.0319831706583,0.0317670479417,0.031144335866,0.0237011965364,0.0185597985983,0.0140002556145,0.0139286564663,0.0127760283649,0.0123451175168,0.0121899284422,0.0120414467528,0.011716760695,0.011716760695,0.0106544569135,0.0102534452453,0.00976705085486,0.00934873148799,0.00931226462126,0.00912901572883,0.00888572167605,0.00820371136069,0.00818056240678,0.00818056240678,0.00816169660538,0.00742112286389,0.00723130488768,0.00720742344856,0.00654093688354,0.00630009826273,0.00617922004312,0.00552168674767,0.00551686156541,0.00551686156541,0.00551686156541,0.00551686156541,0.0054348227568,0.00479640299454,0.00462433323264,0.00459321867675,0.00381686491892,0.0038111701142,0.0038111701142,0.00326919439249,0.00289837084711,0.00242959079333,0.00242691137828,0.00242691137828,0.00242691137828,0.00143644004129,0.00105073081795"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,96635,"Six of us started with fantastic appetizers and refreshing two bottles of wine! We had prosciutto with balsamic mustard and parmigiano butter; housemade mozzarella, toasted garlic bread, lemon and bottarga; roasted trumped mushrooms with arugula, balsamic and Sicilian almonds; whole artichoke with garlic, mint, and parmigiano breadcrumbs; and finally grilled clams with Calabrian chili and breadcrumbs. I least favorite was the artichoke, simply because I am just not a fan of artichokes.  This was a culinary pleasure for the senses. Pleasure from viewing of what arrived in front of you, to what your were smelling, to what you were tasting in your mouth!!! Give me more please!!! And more we got...for our main courses we got wood grilled chicken; branzino, grill blowfish tails with salmoriglio and cracked coriander (my dish), ricotta gnocchi, fettuccine with spicy lamb sausage, mascarpone and spinach filled ravioli.  We all were in culinary heaven!!!! Fantastic! The portions were perfect and service on point.  Of course we got dessert, because one always has room for dessert...and you will NO be disappointed!  Make reservations, it's worth the wait! Sit outside, get there, try the food and enjoy.  I am going back!  And I have been back...day before my 40 birthday! It was fantastic! This time three of us sat inside.  What a great ambiance and staff!!! The restaurant was running a bit behind and we were provided with a glass of procceso and few snacks on the house. We shared appetizers and followed our main courses. I had the Corzetti, Chanterelles, Savory, Aged Goat Cheese, which brought me back to my childhood while eating it.  Mmmmmm...Just perfection!!!

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,618,"The wait is what you'd expect from a reasonably-priced Italian restaurant with a three star New York Times review in North Williamsburg - very, very long.Reservations are scarce for non-verified Twitter users, single passport holders and people who aren't Pete Wells dopplegangers, so my part of two took our chances at a walk-in reservation. At 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday, the quoted wait for two hours for the bar and no options for tables that evening. Lilia is popular enough eschew the process that has made long waits at restaurants tolerable - calling when a reservation is ready. Instead visitors are forced to wait in a non-food serving back bar. The hostess did inform us we could leave and call back about our placement in line. We retreated to the Turkey's Nest, where one ""margarita"" meant stumbling back an hour later to Lilia, where our bar placement was ready far ahead of schedule. Here we get to the food, which is a bit colored by the idea that I had some alcohol before arriving that was the quality of and strength of paint thinner. The first bite of the caco e pepe fritelle must have been what it felt like when the people in the back of the ""Snowpierecer"" train ate sushi after living off bar of compressed insects for years. We promptly ordered a second course. Slightly harder to eat but still successful was the artichoke, presented like a opened lotus flower with breadcrumbs and garlic on top. I could have sucked every last bit of topping off these artichokes, but our main course arrived before that bit of desperation. The malfadini looked amazing, a pasta version of the ribbon candies my Italian grandmother used to be serve the children on December evenings. There was butter and cheese mixed in with pink peppercorns. This unexpected bit of color and taste was ultimately a sour note, for the peppercorns overwhelmed the whole dish. Half as many would go twice as far here.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,49,"I know as a fact that it is only a matter of time before I make my first visit to Lilia, ever since I heard that Missy was departing from the Michelin-rated A Voce. As probably the best female Italian chef, Missy had horned her skill at Spiaggia for five years and I could truly sense that from every single dish we had tried.Four of us had a 8:45 reservation and I had to admit I normally do not eat that late; Lilia was my exception. Shared a couple of small plates, grilled clam - chewy; cauliflower - juicy; trumpet mushroom - oh my god, meaty! Flawless! Pasta was certainly the part that one cannot miss. I would recommend to go with Fettuccine with the lamb sausage, with the pasta completely absorbed the broth, classic!

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,11545,"I have to admit I was a bit excited getting reservations for Lilia since I eat Italian food pretty frequently, it was one I wanted to check off the list. I've heard so many good things as well as family and friends loving it too. Yes, its all amazingly fresh and tasty I'll give Lilia that. Perhaps I was too amped up from hearing all the rave reviews, but after all the hype I still thought it was just ehh, good. I don't mean that in a bad way because I still enjoyed our meal. Service: Service was good not exceptional. Forgot a few orders. Had to remind the wait staff. I'm not a picky person, but when too much time goes by.Very friendly staff. All smiles. Layout is cramped, tables are small. Not a lot of room for multiple dishes and a bottle of wine and extra glasses. I did dig the overall design of the restaurant, minimalist and well thought out. Just not much in the room of comfort. Food: All dishes are not exceptionally large, which gives you ability to try a little bit of everything. * Cacio E Pepe Fritters. Very good! Who doesn't love anything fried.* Mozzarella toasted garlic bread: Fresh mozzarella and a crostini type bread. Loved the addition of the lemon flavor but was a bit too over powering. Mozzarella was on point. * Olives: Good! but they're olives lol. * Radishes with ricotta: No complaints here! Very good whipped ricotta. * Rigatoni: Tasted fantastic, but nothing too exciting. Very standard dish. * Gnocchi: Nailed it. Wonderful full flavors. Can't go wrong with that pesto sauce. * Agnolotti: Suuuuuper rich but very tasty. Loved this. * Olive oil cake: Very soft and fluffy. Wine: A good selection with everything within in a reasonable price range. With some big players on the list as well. I do wish they would add more wines from the Campania region. More wine from this region would compliment the food even more. In the end. Lilia offers you a good standard quality meal which can't steer you wrong, Come here for a quick meal with no frills.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198361,"An experience that could have been better. Since they take reservations atleast a month in advance, we could not make reservations when we called 2 weeks ago. We were told to come in anyway as they take walk ins and we will get a table at the patio. We went amongst all the pasta hype but we were told that there would be a 2 hour wait. Too late to go somewhere else as we had our friends joining us, we started with an hour and a half long wait at the bar/cafeteria at the back with average wine. We finally got a table outside at the patio and started with the cacio fritter, foccacia and trumpet mushrooms. The starters were good and our server was attentive. What followed as the entree were confusing. We ordered 4 pasta dishes and ended up returning back the fettucine as it felt over drenched with peppercorn and way to undercooked.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,139872,"3.75 - there were highs and there were lows. The highs were the mussels and the Agnolotti (top 5 pasta) and the lows were the gnocchi and mafaldini as well as the portion sizes and price points for the portion sizes.Arrived without a reservation on a Saturday at 5:40 and the wait time was 1.5 hours to dine outside. The inside looked trendy and had a cool vibe. Note they do not serve complimentary bread to start (a little pretentious of them, but it is Williamsburg). We order the bread ($12) and it was outstanding (4.5/5). However, the price point on it is criminal and you get two pieces. We shared the cacio e pepe fritelle ($7). You get three small fried balls with a nice balance of cheese inside (4.25/5). My friends thought they could use more cheese, I thought they were perfectly balanced. We shared the mussels ($13) and were a 5/5. The mussels do not come in a pot, but are served more in the same way oysters are served. I thought they were outstanding and some of the best I have had flavor wise (for size of mussels check out Upstate). The Agnolotti, as everyone says, is the reason to come here (5/5). One of the best pastas I have ever had in my life. Everything was perfect from texture to portion size to saffron sauce. Not sure I would trek into Brooklyn and wait 1.5 hours again for this, but I would to try it once. The gnocchi (1/5) may be the worst I have ever had at an Italian restaurant. Very hard. Not soft or pillow like (see Lupa or Hearth). DO NOT order this dish. Mafaldini was fresh and loved the pepper (3.75/5). We were all a bit disappointed in it overall though. It was basically eating seasoned dry pasta. Maybe this is how it is supposed to be served but when we added some of the saffron sauce from the Agnolotti, everyone enjoyed it much more.",3.0 star rating,"New York, NY",2,0,0.10000000149,12.3000001907,"Agnolotti,highs,mussels,mussels,gnocchi,bread,portion sizes,portion,mafaldini,price points,lows,reservation,gnocchi,friends,vibe,inside,price point,pieces,balls,more,mussels,size,cheese,cheese,everyone,Williamsburg,best,some,balance,pot,oysters,way,flavor,everyone,Lupa,pepper,cacio e pepe fritelle,restaurant,pillow,dish,more,pasta,Mafaldini,saffron sauce,some,Upstate,bit,Everything,portion size,Italian,Hearth,pastas,saffron sauce,life,texture,Brooklyn","6,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,2,6,7,7,7,1,7,1,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.304477244616,0.0637040808797,0.0472955778241,0.0446086451411,0.0446086451411,0.0410199314356,0.036096278578,0.0335594639182,0.030547875911,0.030547875911,0.027864895761,0.0267528928816,0.0266078431159,0.0129884546623,0.0101959332824,0.00969276949763,0.00955262035131,0.00879360642284,0.00876164622605,0.00851062498987,0.0083732875064,0.0083732875064,0.00777304172516,0.00776145933196,0.00757813639939,0.00746446615085,0.00707733212039,0.00707733212039,0.00680172955617,0.00677435426041,0.00619962671772,0.00619962671772,0.00619279779494,0.00561933452263,0.00477879913524,0.00477274274454,0.00463847676292,0.00460703205317,0.00460054306313,0.00459755398333,0.0039409105666,0.00389337632805,0.00371315469965,0.00363017641939,0.00363017641939,0.00323059456423,0.00317957787775,0.00303791253828,0.00273800734431,0.00272763939574,0.00272379559465,0.00254605174996,0.00231364904903,0.00202590576373,0.00202413392253,0.00119705987163"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,4474,"Lilia is the best restaurant I have been to in a long time.  Highlights: - menu and execution of it hard to beat...anywhere- very pescaterian friendly, and fairly vegetarian friendly as well, though plenty of meat options- expensive, but worth it, and not a bad price for a restaurant this nice, and particularly given the caliber of the food- good wine list, including some very very interesting aperitifs...I didn't try them but want to return for themI reluctantly give 5 stars because our waiter wasn't on top of things as much as I would have l liked, and as my dad Lon Z. said above, ""dessert was good but nothing special"".  Nonetheless, the rest of the food was so good, and interesting, and fairly priced, and the rest of the service was good, and they had a fun wine list, that it doesn't get any better all in all.I also concur with his assessment of the best dishes: - especially enjoyed the Cauliflower - this was nearly a perfect dish. In particular the sopresada addition was just right- Slow Roasted Tomatoes - not much can be said about this other than they were outstanding- Grilled Scallops--cooked quite rare/too perfection!- Agnolotti - not what I would typically go for, but incredible- Grilled Lamb Steak - I can't remember ever having anything so lamby- Crispy shimp - our group also very much enjoyed this dishAs for dessert, the crostini...or was it a crostada...was outstanding.  The soft serve ice creams not as good.Overall, the pasta dishes definitely skewed towards northern Italian, I believe, and they were all great.Wine list was nice and reasonably priced, but NYC standards at least, and the food was a decent value too.An all around great experience.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",2,0,0.699999988079,3.5,"restaurant,wine list,plenty,Lilia,Lon Z.,execution,meat options,menu,Highlights,group,Scallops,restaurant,wine list,rest,rest,price,caliber,dessert,food,dishes,waiter,service,sopresada addition,all,nothing,things,top,themI,all.,assessment,dishAs,aperitifs,Tomatoes,crostada,dessert,crostini,stars,shimp,anything,ice creams,pasta dishes,Wine list,food,standards,Cauliflower,value,experience,perfection,Italian,NYC,too.An,Lamb Steak","2,7,7,1,1,4,7,7,7,3,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,6","0.125733196735,0.12345521152,0.106261849403,0.0554238222539,0.0434539094567,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0365024283528,0.0273735206574,0.0220143962651,0.0189225263894,0.0175862442702,0.0151888653636,0.0151888653636,0.0140056591481,0.0140056591481,0.0129077862948,0.011825511232,0.0116476574913,0.0112968292087,0.0107580414042,0.010249231942,0.00984625052661,0.00946309417486,0.00946309417486,0.00946309417486,0.00918574631214,0.00861644931138,0.00861644931138,0.00856597721577,0.0082331718877,0.00795719586313,0.00781167065725,0.00733245629817,0.00724019296467,0.00672329263762,0.00641605397686,0.00641605397686,0.00638218969107,0.00599190220237,0.00556730851531,0.00556730851531,0.00529073737562,0.00503950379789,0.00472052115947,0.00443069683388,0.00281523261219,0.00262314919382,0.00262314919382,0.00262314919382,0.00166641722899"

I don't understand how it works but it blows my mind. I finally got a reservation through a friend sI had to see what all the hype was about. I got there and they made us wait about 15 minutes for our table because the table we waited for was procrastinating with the bill. We sat down and ordered drinks and some appetizers. We ordered the Sicilian olives which is a must have with a drink. The house mozzarella on garlic toast is delicious. I could have eaten 2 myself but I didn't. The whole artichoke is also delicious. We ordered 3 pastas because that's what everyone raves about. We ordered the malfandini, agnolotti and gnocchi. The malfandini with pecorino and pink peppercorn was good but not great. It lacked salt, not enough to cheese and the pasta was al dente. The sheeps milk stuffed agnolotti was by far my favorite pasta. The pesto gnocchi also lacked salt and I didn't taste  enough pesto.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,11083,"Heard about Lilia a few months ago. I did my research and bumped it to the top or my list of places I need to try asap. The place is beautiful fresh clean and bright. Very welcoming. The hostesses were very nice. We had our youngest with us 7 months old and Giovanna was very accommodating. My son had a little crush on our server Marissa who was great at letting us know the menu. The only problem I had was it was just the wife and I and we couldn't order as much as we would when we go out with our other foodie couple.  Here's what we could almost manage. Cacio e Pepe Fritelle Pure deliciousness! Crispy outside with a doughy cheesy inside. Excellent must get. Prosciutto, Balsamic Mustard, Parmigiano Butter. Comes with really good bread so I mad myself sandwiches lol.  So good. The mustard was awesome. Housemade Mozzarella, Toasted Garlic Bread, Lemon, Bottarga. Not going to lie but all the pictures I've seen online do not do this dish any justice. Great flavors and textures.Whole Artichoke, Garlic, Mint, Parmigiano, Breadcrumbs. Honestly one of the best artichokes I've had in a while. They flatten it on the dish and serve it in warm oil. So good. Most places the artichoke heart isn't really edible. Not here. Devoured it.Rigatoni Diavola, San Marzanos, Chilies, Oregano, Pecorino. I thought this was going to be the best of the three pastas we ordered. It was good but I was wrong. Mafaldini, Pink Peppercorns, Parmigiano Reggiano. If you like black pepper like I do this dish is black pepper heaven. Must try if you like black pepper. Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey. This was the best of the three pastas that we tried. I was really pleasantly surprised because I don't usually care for saffron. Sweet and savory this is a must get dish. There were other pastas we wanted to try but we were too stuffed, we couldn't find enough stomach space to order main courses. We did leave room for dessert of course. Lol. Chocolate gelato with hazelnuts on top and a really delicious olive oil cake with whip cream and fresh cherries.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3171,"Went to Lilia last month with a friend.  We had heard great things about the place and were excited to try it out.  Reservations are hard to get at typical dinnertime hours (6-9), but there is usually available before 6 and after 9:30 online.  I made a late reservation (9:30) but was lucky enough to get a table around 7pm by walking in.The restaurant is in a former auto shop, with very high ceilings and an open kitchen.  Seating is limited, and there is a bar with approximately 12-15 seats.  Waitstaff were pleasant and helpful.I tried the following dishes:Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms, Arugula, Balsamic, Sicilian Almonds (4/5): Tasty mushroom dish.  The mushrooms had a very savory taste and were not tough or rubbery.Mafaldini, Pink Peppercorns, Parmigiano Reggiano (3/5): I had very high hopes for this dish, as Lilia is known for it.  However, my dining partner and I both did not particularly enjoy it.  The pink peppercorn flavor was interesting and unique, but the pasta was very heavy, and the parmesan was incredibly thick and caked onto the pasta.  It was not a very subtle dish.Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey (5/5): Excellent agnolotti.  The sheeps milk was delicate and slightly sweet, and the agnolotti was cooked very well.  This was definitely my favorite dish.I did enjoy my dinner at Lilia, and I hope to return again to try some of the other dishes on the menu, as well as order the agnolotti again.",4.0 star rating,"Houston, TX",2,1,0.20000000298,5.30000019073,"Lilia,friend,Reservations,place,things,Dried Tomato,table,reservation,mushroom dish,Seating,dishes,mushrooms,dish,dining partner,bar,seats,ceilings,auto shop,restaurant,kitchen,Arugula,taste,sheeps milk,agnolotti,agnolotti,hopes,some,Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms,Milk Cheese,dish.,Honey,dishes,agnolotti,Pink Peppercorns,Sicilian Almonds,Balsamic,Mafaldini,Parmigiano Reggiano,dinner,menu,Waitstaff,parmesan,pasta,Saffron,peppercorn flavor,pasta","1,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,3,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,6,4,7,1,6,7,1,7,6","0.132182583213,0.123097606003,0.0631721541286,0.0592341721058,0.0592341721058,0.0313111506402,0.0290302615613,0.0257645007223,0.0217582769692,0.0212584659457,0.0209490470588,0.0202473569661,0.019877742976,0.0194558575749,0.0186068546027,0.0173662509769,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0152415726334,0.0151635985821,0.0151340588927,0.0140437912196,0.0139334835112,0.0139166908339,0.0138514144346,0.0118188541383,0.0112872477621,0.010979690589,0.0108940619975,0.0103061422706,0.0102257551625,0.00962997879833,0.00937807746232,0.00898418482393,0.00898418482393,0.00896666012704,0.00820583850145,0.00803646631539,0.00712134735659,0.00657438579947,0.00618143333122,0.00618143333122,0.00610374798998,0.00540832616389,0.00517639936879"

I have been trying to get a reservation for two for weeks and finally decided to just try a walk-in. While there were no openings inside or at the bar, my wife and I were seated at a great two-top outside. We weren't in the mood for a huge meal but wanted to make the most of our visit so we ended up with a carafe of delicious red wine (the 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella was excellent) the pasta special, and two apps: the mozzarella toast and the prosciutto. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. Why 4 stars? The service could have been better. I initially thought I couldn't rate Lilia less than 5 stars because the food was so delicious, but honestly, the service was more like a 2-3. Our server was constantly running away from us, darting around table to table with a crazy look in her eyes (I understand being stressed, especially when working an outdoor section, but she was even stressing us out!) and seemed very frustrated about ??? umm -- not sure what ;) it was earlier in the night when we arrived, we were prompt with our decisions and our check was over $150 so I cannot imagine what the issue was, but she annoyed me.

This was a very bright and satisfying way to begin the meal.  The Cacio e pepe fritelle was also delicious, and for a fried snack, it was surprisingly light and fluffy, yet packed with big flavors.  For our entrees, we had the sheep's milk agnolotti and the mafaldini.  The sheep's milk agnolotti had to be one of the most delicious pasta dishes I've ever had.  The sheepiness, for lack of a better word, provided a lovely richness which was balanced by just a touch of sweet honey. This was really well done.  The mafaldini was simple and delicious, reminiscent of a cacio e pepe with a strong, pink peppercorn flavor and the interesting pasta.

The spaghetti and fettuccine were both fairly basic and tasted like dishes you could make at home. The agnolotti was delicious, however, and unlike any pasta dish I have had before.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199297,"I've gotta weigh in on this vaunted establishment and bring the dialog back down the critical path.  The best I can say for my experience is that the decor and crowd are lovely, the wine selection great and we found a ""to die for"" dessert: the lemon ice.  But those things alone don't offset what we found to be a low-value proposition that started with the wine and made its way through appetizers and small plates (we didn't bother with the larger plates since we wanted to graze).  By low-value proposition I mean the prices were fine, but the portions terribly skimpy.  But feel free to see this from the other end of the telescope and consider it a surprisingly pricey place to eat because if you walk in with an appetite, you're walking out with a considerably lighter wallet.So, on to the experience.  Our waitress displayed the warmth of someone who has just learned that a cat has deposited a dead bird on the doorstep.  We wanted to give her an appetizer order so we'd have something on which to nibble as we perused the numerous small plate possibilities, all of which seemed enchanting.  She strongly resisted this idea, telling us the restaurant prefers we order everything at the same time and made it clear it would be our fault, not hers or theirs, if things ordered later took a fortnight to come out of the kitchen.  Fortunately, timing was not an issue.  While she had the good sense to inquire about our meal once it was done, she didn't bother to ask about our experience when we started eating or even before we finished.  Moreover, rather than seeking to address some negative comments, she listened and then clearly ignored the critique, as if she hadn't heard it.Wine service was proper but the quartino we ordered turned out to hold considerably less than the stand one-third of a bottle (although priced as if it would hold half a bottle).  We were so frustrated with the size of the net pour to each of our glasses that we decided to forego additional glasses of wine once the few precious sips had been taken to empty our glasses.We started our meal with the Cacio e Pepe Fritelle.  Somehow they managed, by poor use of the deep fryer, to turn this traditional, lusciously moist and simple pasta and pecorino dish into a dried ball of fried dough.  I think they'd do much better just rolling it once in powdered sugar and selling it out of a truck at a street festival as a substitute for zeppole.  We ate about half the dish and, true to her lack of concern with our experience, our waitress cleared the little fried dough balls without comment.We next turned to the roasted cauliflower and clams.The former, intended to be seasoned with spicy soppressata, Sicilian pesto and majoram, was well cooked but under-seasoned.  The flavor of majoram didn't come through at all, and they sprinkled little bits of soppressata on the bottom of the bowl like it was some terribly expensive, rare earth element.  For the price I'd have expected at least half a head of cauliflower, but after the disappointing wine pour was not surprised that four bites or so did in the entire dish.  In contrast to the vegetable, the grilled clams featuring Calabrian chili were horribly over-seasoned, so much so that the heavy-handed application of the chili made both of us choke at first (take a look at the picture of the clams - would you really want to dump that much chili into your mouth?).  Quite disappointed at that point that we'd already, so quickly, drained our glasses of wine.  Again, the price would have been fair for a couple dozen clams.  For the dozen served, we felt short-changed.Our last dish before calling it quits on the place was roasted trumpet mushrooms.  I'd give this dish a 9 out of 10 for flavor, but again was shocked by the small size of the portion (four or five thinly-sliced pieces of mushroom) and appalled that they set it up on just a few sprigs of arugula.  At this price, an arugula salad bowl topped with the mushrooms would have made more sense.Was the meal a disaster?  Not really.  But given the skimpy portion sizes with execution flaws and unconcerned waitstaff, I won't be back.",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",5,0,-0.300000011921,14.8000001907,"proposition,wine selection,path,establishment,waitress,dialog,experience,wine,experience,plates,plates,appetizers,sense,things,something,crowd,dessert,lemon ice,way,earth element,decor,size,restaurant,someone,plate possibilities,bottle,experience,place,portions,appetite,bottle,dish,proposition,wine,telescope,end,bird,doorstep,cat,warmth,price,glasses.,glasses,glasses,dish,things,dozen,meal,meal,fault,timing,Wine service,soppressata,fortnight,issue,appetizer order,all,fried dough,ball,fried dough balls,wine,everything,idea,hers,kitchen,quartino,critique,comments,sips,each,net,dish,glasses,pecorino,pasta,fryer,use,zeppole,substitute,sugar,truck,street festival,concern,lack,wallet.So,prices,chili,clams,chili,clams,look,application,meal,dish,mouth,picture,both,point,chili,sense.,price,trumpet mushrooms,mushroom,portion,size,mushrooms,waitstaff,portion sizes,arugula salad bowl,Cacio e Pepe Fritelle,place,flavor,arugula,disaster,sprigs,pieces,execution flaws,wine,dish,price,Calabrian,bottom,clams,former,head,cauliflower,majoram,majoram,bowl,cauliflower,pesto,bits,bites,vegetable,contrast,Sicilian","7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,6,7,7,5,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,7,5,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.125328212976,0.0751607939601,0.031047038734,0.031047038734,0.0300448909402,0.0266883857548,0.0234321691096,0.0222182869911,0.0199965368956,0.0184883140028,0.0184883140028,0.0184883140028,0.0178279113024,0.016820654273,0.0161860901862,0.0147972833365,0.0147972833365,0.0147972833365,0.0147216003388,0.0139669813216,0.0138904917985,0.0119392201304,0.0116974823177,0.0109565434977,0.00956898462027,0.00951700937003,0.00755639001727,0.00734113063663,0.00704081449658,0.00702093821019,0.00669191312045,0.00666266446933,0.00640422478318,0.00563709018752,0.00558756198734,0.00558756198734,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00540900416672,0.0050454926677,0.0050454926677,0.0050454926677,0.00488919019699,0.00480360956863,0.00474520632997,0.00469862204045,0.00468777585775,0.00459270784631,0.00447105709463,0.00445969821885,0.00431500468403,0.00414979225025,0.00398897053674,0.00395128829405,0.00395128829405,0.00389770721085,0.00389770721085,0.0038906421978,0.00383157725446,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00373444659635,0.00373444659635,0.00373444659635,0.00373032921925,0.00373032921925,0.00373032921925,0.00363712757826,0.00342931621708,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340388040058,0.00340388040058,0.00330806523561,0.00328287784941,0.00318828597665,0.00318828597665,0.00318828597665,0.00318402936682,0.00295389792882,0.00266893184744,0.00262784794904,0.00256569799967,0.00253692385741,0.00253692385741,0.00253692385741,0.00253518507816,0.00241210917011,0.00239003705792,0.00236835656688,0.00234710425138,0.00220159045421,0.00220159045421,0.00220159045421,0.00220034969971,0.00219802395441,0.00219802395441,0.00210535363294,0.00202054018155,0.00200351863168,0.00200233678333,0.00200233678333,0.00186536798719,0.00175172882155,0.00175172882155,0.00174889084883,0.0016826846404,0.00159927911591,0.00150594976731,0.00150153925642,0.00140017736703,0.00138046417851,0.0013316256227,0.0012798680691,0.0012744772248,0.0012744772248,0.00127343425993,0.00127343425993,0.00127245532349,0.00111494353041,0.00111403106712,0.0011131745996,0.001112367725,0.001112367725,0.000659819343127"

One cocktail was served  in a chipped and cracked glass.We ordered 7 dishes and 2 desserts between 3 of us.The service is sad, completely unacceptable. Not once did our waiter check on us or how our meal was. Literal no eye contact or attention.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,67716,"Oh lawd, lawd have mercy. I am clutching my pearls with how surprisingly delicious dinner was.I came here tonight with a fellow foodie friend; insistent that I eat here before Pete Well's reviews it for the NYT and it becomes nigh impossible to get a reservation more so than it already is. For the next few weeks out the only reservations available are 6pm or 10pm.The space is palatial compared to most restaurants in Williamsburg. It's open, white, high ceilings and surrounded by windows that will bathe the restaurant in beautiful light during the day. They also have a coat check! I could literally write a three-page essay on why I dislike hooks, winter coats, and the lack of coat checks in this city.My friend and I are promptly seated, going back and forth on what to order. I spend some time debating whether or not I need a proper protein because the pasta I want really doesn't have any but our list was getting rather long so I'll make do with a carb-heavy unbalanced dinner for the evening. The menu doesn't actually look all that interesting, I picked this place because I had heard quite a bit about the head chef, Missy Robbins (of Spiaggia and A Voce) but Italian food with scallops, mushroom, clams, lamb chops, and branzino on the menu doesn't necessarily excite me. Oh great, branzino on another New York menu? Of the 30,000 fish species you couldn't pick something interesting? But holy hell, the blasé sounding dishes I had were executed to perfection/near-perfection.First up for starters we order the grilled clams with calabrian chili & bread crumbs ($16), the grilled bread with chestnut crema and pancetta ($8), and the grilled mushrooms with almonds, garlic and pepper ($14). In order those were my favorites. I would pass on the mushrooms, they were nice but not very interesting. The grilled clams had a very subtle heat to them and the bread crumbs stayed crunchy throughout. Yay for no soggy drenched bready clams!For our pastas we ordered the beautiful malfadini with peppercorns & cheese ($18) and sheepsmilk cheese agnolotti with saffron, tomato, and honey ($22). This is where it gets really good, let's skip the agnolotti, it was good and maybe I would've paid more attention to it if I hadn't tried the malfadini first which captured my heart instantaneously. I fell in love with my eyes and then fell in love once more once it hit my lips. I swear, before tonight you could not convince me that a simple plain pasta barely dressed but with a mere kiss of cheese and pepper could taste so heavenly -- if we were discussing Greek mythos, Missy Robbin's malfadini was the ambrosia eaten by the waywardly deities. But could you expect anything less from a chef who is one of 10 women to hold a Michelin star?Now we move along to the desserts. I order the olive oil cake with whipped cream ($8) and the double chocolate torte ($8). To be quite frank, I passed on the torte. It was a bit too dark and bitter for my tastes. The olive oil cake was lovely, but I've had better. Total bill sans imbibing (with tax) came out to be $102.34. Not bad at all. The service was exceptional too. Our waiter let us try a few wines on the search for a bone-dry white, a las nothing by the glass was anywhere near dry enough. Tip: There are 3 doors to the restaurant. The door you want is the on Frost St. The doors on Union Ave. are for the cafe section, and the servers. If you walk into the cafe you'll be greeted by a barista and not a peppy host asking to take your coat.",5.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",4,0,0.10000000149,13.8999996185,"mercy,reservation,restaurants,space,dinner,foodie friend,reservations,hooks,list,reviews,pearls,ceilings,windows,mushrooms,NYT,Pete Well,Williamsburg,malfadini,essay,winter coats,restaurant,pasta,coat check,coat checks,friend,agnolotti,light,lack,clams,clams,clams,protein,mushroom,menu,menu,pepper,bread,dishes,clams,menu,dinner,food,head chef,branzino,bit,branzino,pastas,malfadini,cheese,peppercorns,perfection,starters,bread crumbs,star,favorites,chef,bread crumbs,cheese agnolotti,place,scallops,lamb chops,fish species,something,garlic,almonds,pancetta,chestnut crema,chili,hell,order,olive oil cake,service,heat,saffron,tomato,honey,attention,city.My,love,wines,olive oil cake,chocolate torte,torte,bit,bill,coat,doors,door,Missy Robbins,desserts,cream,tastes,tax,Italian,A Voce,Spiaggia,New York,First,restaurant,nothing,doors,servers,cafe,search,white,waiter,glass,anywhere,Tip,cafe section,host,barista,malfadini,Michelin,cheese,pepper,pasta,one,anything,love,ambrosia,heart,eyes,lips,kiss,mythos,deities,women,Frost St.,Union Ave,Missy Robbin,Greek","7,7,2,2,7,1,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,7,3,1,2,7,5,7,2,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,7,7,5,7,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,2,3,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,1,1,1,3,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,1,7","0.0477207116783,0.0334631055593,0.0284240562469,0.027707291767,0.0259938370436,0.0259938370436,0.0258609931916,0.0248249601573,0.0235550608486,0.022751012817,0.022751012817,0.0225525032729,0.0219352860004,0.0201217588037,0.0134825278074,0.0134825278074,0.0134134870023,0.0131617411971,0.0126958042383,0.0115928193554,0.0108269136399,0.0103495521471,0.00982032250613,0.00979766529053,0.00979766529053,0.00874388497323,0.00861675851047,0.00857259985059,0.00779889756814,0.00776748592034,0.00754996668547,0.00725628715008,0.00724602071568,0.00724602071568,0.00723521178588,0.00721683353186,0.00721683353186,0.00712396996096,0.00708016892895,0.00688781356439,0.006601780653,0.00659061595798,0.00659061595798,0.00659061595798,0.00659061595798,0.00658078351989,0.00657819025218,0.00657819025218,0.00657819025218,0.00657819025218,0.00656406581402,0.00656406581402,0.00656406581402,0.00635556224734,0.0063332663849,0.00610332377255,0.00598836829886,0.00598313333467,0.00576617987826,0.00576617987826,0.00576617987826,0.0057498915121,0.0057498915121,0.00574294803664,0.00574294803664,0.00574294803664,0.00574294803664,0.00574294803664,0.00574294803664,0.00573661644012,0.00530912587419,0.00530087947845,0.00523920636624,0.0052346251905,0.0052346251905,0.0052346251905,0.00523034390062,0.00507553992793,0.00498981401324,0.00446242420003,0.00445350399241,0.00445350399241,0.00445075007156,0.00444812513888,0.00430228095502,0.00422484381124,0.00418564816937,0.00413290690631,0.00390157243237,0.00389877380803,0.00389623874798,0.00389153230935,0.00388724077493,0.00341333239339,0.00341333239339,0.00341333239339,0.00340823736042,0.00339957489632,0.00337543198839,0.00320906098932,0.00316803483292,0.00306726642884,0.00306599121541,0.00268697459251,0.00268697459251,0.00268697459251,0.00268697459251,0.00268697459251,0.00268573523499,0.00268338620663,0.00268227048218,0.00268227048218,0.00256793154404,0.00230762711726,0.00215011555701,0.00215011555701,0.00215011555701,0.00212097144686,0.00196553627029,0.00195691152476,0.00182273844257,0.00171327556018,0.00171195843723,0.00171195843723,0.00171071756631,0.00171071756631,0.00171071756631,0.00170954468194,0.00158881454263,0.00158881454263,0.00115728145465,0.0010124045657"

We had prosciutto with balsamic mustard and parmigiano butter; housemade mozzarella, toasted garlic bread, lemon and bottarga; roasted trumped mushrooms with arugula, balsamic and Sicilian almonds; whole artichoke with garlic, mint, and parmigiano breadcrumbs; and finally grilled clams with Calabrian chili and breadcrumbs. I least favorite was the artichoke, simply because I am just not a fan of artichokes.  This was a culinary pleasure for the senses. Pleasure from viewing of what arrived in front of you, to what your were smelling, to what you were tasting in your mouth!!! Give me more please!!! And more we got...for our main courses we got wood grilled chicken; branzino, grill blowfish tails with salmoriglio and cracked coriander (my dish), ricotta gnocchi, fettuccine with spicy lamb sausage, mascarpone and spinach filled ravioli.  We all were in culinary heaven!!!! Fantastic! The portions were perfect and service on point.  Of course we got dessert, because one always has room for dessert...and you will NO be disappointed!  Make reservations, it's worth the wait! Sit outside, get there, try the food and enjoy.  I am going back!  And I have been back...day before my 40 birthday! It was fantastic! This time three of us sat inside.  What a great ambiance and staff!!! The restaurant was running a bit behind and we were provided with a glass of procceso and few snacks on the house. We shared appetizers and followed our main courses. I had the Corzetti, Chanterelles, Savory, Aged Goat Cheese, which brought me back to my childhood while eating it.  Mmmmmm...Just perfection!!! Nice bottle of red (plenty to choose from) and of course my favorite dessert to end the evening...strawberry crostata with a candle to make a wish.  Thank you Lilia and its staff for another special evening.",5.0 star rating,"New Dorp, Staten Island, NY",2,0,0.5,14.1000003815,"bottles,appetizers,wine,artichoke,pleasure,artichoke,garlic bread,bottarga,arugula,almonds,mushrooms,lemon,mozzarella,parmigiano butter,mustard,prosciutto,Sicilian,Corzetti,parmigiano breadcrumbs,breadcrumbs,artichokes,chili,garlic,Pleasure,food,clams,mint,fan,senses,courses,dessert,one,mouth,front,viewing,mascarpone,ravioli,spinach,lamb sausage,more,dish,coriander,salmoriglio,grill blowfish tails,ricotta gnocchi,branzino,heaven,service,point,course,room,wait,Calabrian,appetizers,dessert,courses,childhood,chicken,fettuccine,reservations,glass,procceso,snacks,house,course,bottle,dessert,staff,perfection,red,plenty,strawberry crostata,candle,restaurant,portions,Chanterelles,Savory,Aged Goat Cheese,wish,staff,birthday,ambiance,bit,Lilia","6,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,2,5,7,7,6,7,1,4,7,7,1","0.0663786754012,0.0627646744251,0.0550073646009,0.0463081635535,0.036790560931,0.0330030210316,0.0330030210316,0.0330030210316,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0262982528657,0.0156008526683,0.0130510712042,0.01264210511,0.01264210511,0.0125774210319,0.0115005057305,0.0115005057305,0.0113679198548,0.0100802984089,0.0100639527664,0.0100639527664,0.0100124282762,0.0099760312587,0.00840455293655,0.00764760933816,0.00726776896045,0.00671779736876,0.00671779736876,0.00671779736876,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00668922159821,0.00667791487649,0.0060939011164,0.0060939011164,0.00608654646203,0.00608654646203,0.00607983954251,0.00596093479544,0.00593004748225,0.00564250489697,0.00559991877526,0.00515525275841,0.00493510253727,0.00481157517061,0.00471862778068,0.00451618479565,0.00451618479565,0.00451618479565,0.00451618479565,0.0039199590683,0.0039199590683,0.0039199590683,0.00356339802966,0.00312100141309,0.00311924284324,0.00311924284324,0.00311924284324,0.00311924284324,0.00301009975374,0.00288461428136,0.00267014978454,0.00267014978454,0.00267014978454,0.00242050085217,0.00226565939374,0.00198670243844,0.00198211381212,0.00198075501248,0.0018220632337"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198218,"This restaurant books about 2 weeks out - we made a reservation for a Friday night and ordered the squid, scallops, gnocchi, agnolotti, mushrooms, lamb steak, vanilla gelato, and chocolate torta. Our bill after tip, tax and wine for two was $200, which we felt was too high for the quality of the food.The squid was a pleasant dish - it wasn't innovative, but it was tender and with a good tomato sauce - and I also liked the agnolotti. But the rest of the dishes that we ordered were pretty big disappointments. The scallops and gnocchi were bland, the mushrooms were a combination of flavors that didn't compliment one another, and the lamb was tough rather than tender. The chocolate torta was also very dry.There is a Sommelier if you're into that, but it seemed like he didn't help everyone - if you know what I'm getting at. Which is dissimilar to other top-rated restaurants in the area.Overall the restaurant is over-hyped. From articles and overhearing the management talk, it's created and managed by manhattanites - which explains why it's trendy without very good food and with high prices. I overheard one of the managers explain to another manhattanite / friend who was dining there say about the area, ""no, I don't think I have come across a lot of people who do drugs...""Despite all of the above, I was originally going to give this restaurant three stars for the service (nice servers and great front of house staff), but about 4 hours after dinner my partner and I started feeling really sick. Let's just say it has not been a good night for us and certainly won't be as romantic as we had planned...Definitely don't plan on coming back - there are a lot of other restaurants in Williamsburg that are fantastic - both upscale and casual.

Service and ambience were great, but we were really looking for high quality Italian food.  We got the scallops with marjoram in a yogurt sauce, the mafaldini, and rigatoni. The two scallops were well-cooked but were overly sauced, and were topped with a handful of raw walnuts that looked and tasted like they had been poured straight from the bag. Definitely not worth nearly $20. The rigatoni were okay, again well cooked but sauced with a bland, probably jarred tomato sauce.  Though I liked the concept of the mafaldini, the pepper overpowered any other flavors.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10943,"Wow, this place is great.. This is one of the more exciting and enjoyable meals I have had (outside of China) in a long time.. In fact, I can't think of another restaurant in Brooklyn that I would rather go to.  I would go back for lunch today and eat some of those things I had last night again.   We started with the Cacio e pepe fritlle which essentially was a beautiful gougeres covered in a beautiful pecorino.  They were perfectly made and the cheese was just so delicious.. Next up, this dish was outrageous, the bagna cauda.. what seemed to be a half share of a CSA was served with grilled bread and a delicious, anchovy filled warm bagna cauda kept heated over a candle..  The vegetables were delicious.. There was radicchio, baby potatoes, romesco, snap peas and radishes perfectly cooked and or subtly seasoned.. Some of them were a tad spicy with finely crushed pepper, other had a slight hint of lemon..  In fact, there seems to be some type of chile pepper in all of the dishes.. Whether it's flakes or flecks or ground, there a nice balanced heat..  It was just beautifully done.. Precious in a good way, i would say.. This is just fantastic. blow fish tails are just ok.. There is a monkfish quality to blow fish that just makes it a boring fish. They were cooked ok and the sauce was had a nice acid to it but, at the end of the day, it's just not an exciting fish. The clams are a stop everything and run to get this dish..  Pickled Calabrian chile peppers with butter and super fine toasted bread crumbs.. And the portion was large ta boot..  Really great. agnolotti with honey:  a beautiful plate of pasta. Little gem salad:  this was shockingly good.. It was a grown up version of the typical salad you would get at Italian American restaurant.. Except the vinegar was a strong and acidic. the oregano fresh and bright and there was no pile of water at the bottom of the bowl.. Same tiny crunch bread crumbs from the clams.  Love this salad. The last dish, which was a shame to end on was the Ricotta Gnocchi.. This was the only misstep of the entire night.. And it happened on two levels. We arrived last night as the kitchen was closing.. So, we placed our entire ordered at once.. After all the food was served our waitress asked us if we would like coffee or dessert. I asked about the Gnocchi.. She said hold on one moment and went back to the kitchen.. When she came back I said, we don't really need the dish.. I even kind of said, we would prefer not to have it as we were full.. She was graciously adamant.   Now, we all know that the kitchen closes at 11 and it was well passed that time.  So, the dish arrives and the gnocchi is rather hard..  I had heard it be described as pillowy and light.. this was anything but.. I was sad, it was dense and gummy.   The whole dish just didn't feel right.  Not on par with any of the other dishes we had and it makes me feel like it was slapped together. if i can say one thing, the flavors were there, the pistachios were delicious.   this place is a gem, the space is beautiful, staff is professional..

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,2742,"I'm so torn about this review because if I was rating Lilia solely based on the food and drinks, it would've been 5 stars! Throughout the meal, I was so excited about the everything I ate and drank. Unfortunately, the service was bad enough that it knocks off several stars. We had quite a spread between the two of us--and was dining for a celebratory occasion, so we were in very good spirits. We were walk-ins on a Friday night, and the wait was about an hour, which was just enough time to have a couple delightful cocktails from the cafe in the back. For food, we ordered:- cured sardines on toast - flavorful and surprising - scallops - plump and fresh- potatoes with shaved black truffle - decadent - fettuccine with lamb - bright taste of tomatoes, savory lamb sausage, and handmade fettuccine- mafaldini with pink peppercorn - star of the night, just simple and great textureJust everything was a hit! And I was already raving about the meal from the perfect negroni I had to start. We were even talking about Lilia stands strong next to other Italian powerhouse restaurants such as Babbo.  Despite the superb kitchen.... Our waitress must have been drunk or something. Upon first greeting us, she knocked a candle and spilled hot wax towards us. She forgot to bring us our bar snacks. We ordered wine and she was distracted talking to other guests/friends in the middle of pouring a glass. No joke, it took 10 mins for her to pour 1 glass of wine. Unfortunately, in the fettuccine, my husband bit into something hard and thought he chipped a tooth when he spat out a piece of ceramic. It turned out to be a piece of a broken bowl. We notified the waitress to which she responded immediately ""I'll get you another one."" Didn't apologize for the situation, and acted like it was just a usual occurrence. Someone from the kitchen actually brought out the replacement dish and sincerely apologized. When we asked for the bill, we did expect the fettuccine to be removed from the bill. I suppose by the food, I was putting Lilia up there with the Jean Georges or Mario Batali type establishments, which would try to find resolution to the mishap. Nope -- not only was the fettuccine still on the bill, we also had an EXTRA appetizer and 3 EXTRA drinks on the bill that we didn't have! The waitress came back around almost annoyed that we asked the bill to be corrected. The entire meal, we gave so many passes and continued to enjoy the meal even with the mishaps-- but at this point, poor service was evident. The bill came back, corrected, and we decided to tip 20% on everything except for the fettuccine (mind you, bill was still $200). The waitress hovered and watched as to pressure, and she made it a point to grab the check and look at it while we putting our coats on. She then said ""get home safe"" in a way that read ""go f* youself.""  Our waitress wasn't the only one with the attitude. We sat by the door and someone came to offer us blankets due to the cold draft--super cute idea, but when we declined she rolled her eyes as if we made some sort of inconvenience for her. Upon arriving, there was a lady on the phone giving mouth to a customer on the phone about how busy they usually are. The service here really spoiled one of the best pasta meals I've had in awhile.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,40798,"I was thrown by some of Lilia's more negative reviews, but I'm glad I reserved judgment until I went and tried the food for myself! I actually made a reservation several weeks ago on a whim, forgot about it, and then was pleasantly surprised to see a confirmation text from Resy the day before our meal. Like a gift to myself from myself! High five, me from the past.As everyone has already noted, the interior is beautifully open and bright. I loved the rustic wood ceiling and the faint smell of burning wood from the ovens. Both the hostess and our server greeted us warmly.We started with the super photogenic grilled clams with Calabrian chili and breadcrumbs, as well as the bagna cauda with winter vegetables. The clams were just as tasty as they are beautiful; the chili sauce had a slightly sweet and tangy kick to it with a good amount of heat. I would love to eat mounds of these while relaxing on some tropical beach, tanned men bringing me tray after tray of clams. The bagna cauda was ordered mainly out of curiosity, and while it was tasty, it just couldn't compare to the clams and probably wouldn't be appreciated by anyone who can't tolerate a strong fishy flavor. For pastas, we chose the mafaldini and sheeps milk cheese agnolotti. Both were excellent. I have to disagree with other reviews mentioning them being served at room temp or tasting too salty. Both pastas came out hot and perfectly seasoned. The mafaldini was just fun to eat. The shape of the noodles and relatively simple preparation made for a comforting dish that I could eat any time. Like at 2 am when I can't sleep because random thoughts of food enter my mind. The agnolotti surprised me - I wasn't sure how saffron and honey would play in a pasta dish, but I loved how the creamy cheese complimented the sweetness of the honey and the elusive flavor of the saffron (seriously, can anyone put into words what that flavor is?). The service throughout the meal was fine; I did have to get the server's attention to order and to get the check.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198892,"I was visiting New York on a general gorging myself with food trip, and was excited to try Lilia because seasonal, rustic Italian food and pasta is something right up my alley. We lined up before the 5:30 opening, and were able with some luck to get a table by 8 PM ( the wait was nbd to me, we walked over to Four Horsemen and shared a bottle of delicious wine to start).I was with three others so we got to order a ton and try a little bit of everything on the menu. The food and atmosphere in general were lovely. I was particularly a fan of the cured sardines on toast, the clams, and the veal steak we had as an entree. The only let down was the service, both at the host stand at the beginning of the night ( I asked a couple of questions about seating, and the hostess just gave me the same line over and over in an annoyed tone). Our server was fine, I found his mandate that we order everything at once annoying, but I get that some restaurants do this, ostensibily to estimate table turn times and to be able to course out the dinner appropriately. Accodingly, it was really surpring to me that all three of the pasta dishes we ordered came out cold. I pointed this out to our server and he responded by saying ""Word. I'll give the chef your feedback."" and walked away. We waited a moment for him to come back to see if he's take our plates away or offer to refire the course, but he disappeared. We were hungry so ended up eating it after a while. Our other courses arrived with no issues.I've worked as a restaurant server for 10 years so I understand the realities of restaurant work. I know that sometimes it's not up to the server to decide whether or not a dish gets comped. But I do know that response was inappropriate, and really surprising given Lilia's profile, popularity, and price point and especially because this place is KNOWN FOR THEIR PASTA. In hindisght, we probably should've insisted that a manager speak with us, but I'm doubtful they would respond differently.With tip, we spent $440 on a decent meal that left a very sour taste in my mouth.",2.0 star rating,"Alexandria, VA",3,1,0.0,8.80000019073,"fan,something,pasta,Lilia,food trip,alley,New York,table,server,Italian,luck,bit,wait,bottle,everything,general,nbd,service,others,wine,menu,ton,atmosphere,restaurants,meal,hostess,everything,table,couple,pasta dishes,veal steak,entree,clams,toast,sardines,line,seating,questions,host stand,tone,mandate,restaurant server,server,chef,dinner,Four Horsemen,food,response,dish,realities,restaurant work,profile,popularity,feedback,Accodingly,PASTA,Word,price point,place,mouth,tip,manager,hindisght,taste,plates,course,courses,issues.","1,7,7,1,4,7,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,1,1,7,1,6,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7","0.577186346054,0.12539319694,0.0260391831398,0.0214963350445,0.0207874644548,0.0207874644548,0.016105607152,0.0146020557731,0.0135561563075,0.0123681267723,0.00994065962732,0.00631024874747,0.00454215565696,0.00437297578901,0.00434771180153,0.00432546250522,0.00405323738232,0.0038848570548,0.00380467693321,0.00380467693321,0.00380467693321,0.00380467693321,0.00378519995138,0.00318359490484,0.00317564955913,0.00290256598964,0.00289587141015,0.00289587141015,0.00277522439137,0.00264499359764,0.00254692602903,0.00254692602903,0.00254692602903,0.00254692602903,0.00254692602903,0.00253973645158,0.00253973645158,0.00253973645158,0.00253973645158,0.00253973645158,0.00253387726843,0.00246394122951,0.00246162898839,0.0023963295389,0.00231883791275,0.00225361110643,0.00206145946868,0.00204503443092,0.0019590666052,0.00171565788332,0.00171565788332,0.00171254877932,0.00171254877932,0.00163845939096,0.00163640058599,0.0014900714159,0.00136797502637,0.00118570926134,0.00118570926134,0.00118473940529,0.00118473940529,0.00118473940529,0.00118473940529,0.00104364950676,0.000878041784745,0.000861956796143,0.000860132626258,0.0007524897228"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,61,"KenScale: 8.0/10No restaurant in New York City is hotter than Lilia in Williamsburg at the moment. Headed by star chef Missy Robbins, who was last seen at A Voce in Columbus Circle and Flatiron, Lilia has so many things you would love if you're looking for a great neighborhood place. I think the restaurant's vision of itself has changed over time following glowing reviews; while it probably intended to be more of a neighborhood favorite for Brooklynites, it has become a destination dining place for people from all over the city, including Manhattan. I mean, you can't blame them. With a chic and inviting décor that screams a hang-out place for all the cool kids in the city, plus celebrity chef's comeback, it just sounds too good to be true. After making multiple futile efforts to get reservations, I just decided to try for walk-ins and hope for the best. When my dining party of four arrived at slightly after 6 p.m., we were quoted a wait time of 1.5-2 hours, and at the bar area (not at one of the tables since they were all fully booked). Since all of us had late lunches, we were fine with waiting at a nearby café and killing time. After showing up 2 hours later, we were stuck in the bar adjacent to the dining space, patiently waiting our turn. We finally got seated slightly before 9 p.m.! I think Lilia probably set my all-time records for a restaurant wait. They'd better be worth it and be as good as what all the critics are saying, I thought while looking across the table where chef Robbins was standing at the kitchen directly all the staffs there. I haven't been to A Voce before, so I really didn't know what to expect from chef Robbins' kitchen. I'm all for a rich and flavorful Italian meal, but I also try to avoid heavy salt intake. Overall, I felt the food from Lilia could've toned down a little in the seasoning department, starting with cacao e pepe frittelle (yes, think cacao e pepe in fried donuts), which could've been a marvelous snack had the flavor been not too aggressive. On the other hand, I loved the fresh verdure crude, warm anchovy and garlic salad with bagna cauda that was an excellent start to the meal. There are some small seafood appetizers at Lilia, and you should definitely try at least a dish or two. I was a fan of cured sardines with capers and dill that had the right amount of salt in it, and grilled clams with Calabrian chilies and breadcrumbs were also quite delicious. I had the highest expectations for chef Robbins' pastas, which are nothing fancy like at other places like Marea but seem to really emphasize the quality of ingredients and simple elegance. All the dishes that I had tried were good, but again this is where I wished the seasoning were slightly moderated. I enjoyed the rustic touch of mafaldini with pink pepper corn and parmigiano reggiano, and the aromatic flavor of sheeps milk filled agnolotti with saffron, dried tomato and honey was also something to remember. Both dishes, however, felt a little too aggressive in seasoning and had I not shared each with three other dining companion, I wasn't sure if I could've finished each by myself. Surprisingly, ricotta gnocchi with broccoli pesto and basil had more balance in flavor. Of the entrée dishes, we shared grilled branzino with salsa verde, and I really liked the simple touch of well-cooked branzino that worked quite harmoniously with salsa verde. For desserts, olive oil cake with blood oranges, grappas and whipped cream seems to be the safe choice, but I also really liked the soft serves, particularly the vanilla one that had lemony walnuts, arametti cookies, sprinkles and chocolate stracci for toppings. It could've been a perfect antidote if you had dined at the restaurant on a hot summer day.As mentioned above, getting a reservation at Lilia is going to be a Herculean task. The best way is to just get there when the restaurant opens up at 5:30 p.m. and hope for the best on walk-in spaces, including outdoor tables that the restaurant has set aside (in that regard, showing up in smaller groups would certainly help). The restaurant has a full bar, and I really enjoyed some of the Italian wine selections that I had by the glass. You will love the atmosphere of the restaurant, which has a cozy vibe that makes you feel you belong in the place where all the handsome people hang out. I will say this: Lilia would have probably been one of the best neighborhood restaurants; in the overall schema of Italian restaurants in the city, I will have to see how it evolves over time to match other great Italian dining destinations.",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",5,0,0.40000000596,19.6000003815,"fan,Lilia,Missy Robbins,restaurant,restaurant,restaurant,bagna cauda,New York City,destination dining place,neighborhood place,city,Williamsburg,KenScale,10No,tables,Italian,people,vision,fried donuts,things,neighborhood favorite,reviews,décor,table,A Voce,salt,all,sardines,Columbus Circle,Flatiron,Brooklynites,reservations,pastas,place,celebrity chef,dish,city,best,flavor,efforts,vanilla one,place,hope,one,critics,comeback,kids,walk-ins,bar area,dining party,lunches,Manhattan,dishes,places,tables,bar,selections,dining space,restaurant wait,kitchen,seasoning,kitchen,meal,little,cacao e,cacao e,meal,crude,touch,café,turn,records,staffs,salt intake,food,seasoning department,garlic,salad,anchovy,hand,seafood appetizers,best,chilies,amount,dill,capers,breadcrumbs,quality,expectations,ingredients,elegance,mafaldini,pepper corn,touch,choice,task,way,neighborhood restaurants,restaurants,snack,reservation,spaces,hope,serves,toppings,cream,grappas,blood oranges,walnuts,cookies,sprinkles,stracci,chocolate,Voce,city,bar,antidote,Calabrian,Marea,people,dining destinations,some,atmosphere,groups,regard,glass,vibe,schema,dishes,entrée dishes,day.As,Herculean,clams,each,branzino,seasoning,flavor,salsa verde,salsa verde,branzino,something,ricotta gnocchi,olive oil cake,honey,tomato,saffron,agnolotti,sheeps milk,parmigiano reggiano,dining companion,balance,basil,broccoli pesto,desserts,flavor","1,1,1,2,2,2,7,2,2,2,2,2,7,3,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,2,2,1,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,1,7,2,1,4,2,7,2,7,2,7,2,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,2,2,7,2,1,1,2,1,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7","0.186801120639,0.160084873438,0.0950601249933,0.0829194784164,0.0616289302707,0.0312438607216,0.0143015803769,0.0117266159505,0.0112894847989,0.0100005986169,0.00937084015459,0.00867798831314,0.00867798831314,0.00867798831314,0.0083794593811,0.00813031755388,0.00792210083455,0.00711063621566,0.00703865662217,0.00696860952303,0.00693294778466,0.00693294778466,0.00669960631058,0.00562202837318,0.00471802987158,0.00465621054173,0.00457260990515,0.00434056669474,0.0041282735765,0.0041282735765,0.00410712324083,0.00386478472501,0.00382147775963,0.00377784343436,0.00377784343436,0.00359278125688,0.00355761800893,0.00354940886609,0.00347297545522,0.00338154006749,0.00322984857485,0.00300916330889,0.00299958256073,0.0029937280342,0.00287907617167,0.00263047916815,0.00263047916815,0.00262440717779,0.00261928420514,0.00261928420514,0.00261485460214,0.00241202116013,0.00229515391402,0.00229475600645,0.00223480467685,0.00221487134695,0.00209599034861,0.00201448658481,0.00200936780311,0.00200715241954,0.00200636126101,0.00200511631556,0.00200323318131,0.00200148182921,0.00200148182921,0.00200148182921,0.00199984456412,0.00181746203452,0.00180072046351,0.00176507013384,0.00176243600436,0.00175795715768,0.00175601860974,0.00175258959644,0.00175105710514,0.00175105710514,0.0017496246146,0.0017496246146,0.0017496246146,0.0017496246146,0.0016408766387,0.00160712376237,0.00159862567671,0.00159862567671,0.00159862567671,0.00159862567671,0.00159862567671,0.00159753009211,0.00159753009211,0.00159753009211,0.00159753009211,0.00159550376702,0.00159550376702,0.00157967791893,0.00145675288513,0.00145602843259,0.0014553318033,0.00144097220618,0.00144097220618,0.00141148583498,0.0013586563291,0.00135800614953,0.00135800614953,0.00121976598166,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118921487592,0.00118688703515,0.00111107423436,0.00103315361775,0.000958079472184,0.000946210406255,0.000945561740082,0.000939223333262,0.000938819546718,0.000927798100747,0.00085353461327,0.000822409463581,0.000822409463581,0.000822030124255,0.000821664289106,0.000821311026812,0.000706537801307,0.000705758400727,0.000703487079591,0.000703487079591,0.000692141009495,0.000686382700223,0.000685625476763,0.000656405463815,0.000656035437714,0.000655681360513,0.000655681360513,0.000596326601226,0.000556782761123,0.000556140556,0.000548549287487,0.000522562128026,0.000522562128026,0.000522562128026,0.000522562128026,0.000522562128026,0.000522562128026,0.000522253860254,0.000521959387697,0.000521959387697,0.000521959387697,0.000521407579072,0.000472259765957"
Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,618,"The wait is what you'd expect from a reasonably-priced Italian restaurant with a three star New York Times review in North Williamsburg - very, very long.Reservations are scarce for non-verified Twitter users, single passport holders and people who aren't Pete Wells dopplegangers, so my part of two took our chances at a walk-in reservation. At 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday, the quoted wait for two hours for the bar and no options for tables that evening. Lilia is popular enough eschew the process that has made long waits at restaurants tolerable - calling when a reservation is ready. Instead visitors are forced to wait in a non-food serving back bar. The hostess did inform us we could leave and call back about our placement in line. We retreated to the Turkey's Nest, where one ""margarita"" meant stumbling back an hour later to Lilia, where our bar placement was ready far ahead of schedule. Here we get to the food, which is a bit colored by the idea that I had some alcohol before arriving that was the quality of and strength of paint thinner. The first bite of the caco e pepe fritelle must have been what it felt like when the people in the back of the ""Snowpierecer"" train ate sushi after living off bar of compressed insects for years. We promptly ordered a second course. Slightly harder to eat but still successful was the artichoke, presented like a opened lotus flower with breadcrumbs and garlic on top. I could have sucked every last bit of topping off these artichokes, but our main course arrived before that bit of desperation. The malfadini looked amazing, a pasta version of the ribbon candies my Italian grandmother used to be serve the children on December evenings. There was butter and cheese mixed in with pink peppercorns. This unexpected bit of color and taste was ultimately a sour note, for the peppercorns overwhelmed the whole dish.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,145220,"Lilia is a cool spot for a cozy dinner with friends or date.  The place has a casual, Brooklyn vibe.  Chef Missy Robbins does not disappoint -- her reputation is well deserved for the excellent pastas.  Definitely worth a try and a decent value, but could use some polishing to reach its full potential.Atmosphere- Cool modernized ex-industrial space - very Brooklyn.- Relaxed and unpretentious, inviting place to meet friends.- Pleasant din, but not overly loud for conversation.FoodWe began with the House Made Mozzarella ($10) which was served atop toasted garlic bread, lemon zest and bottarga (cured fish roe, though not overly perceptible) and the Prosciutto ($12) accompanied by balsamic mustard and parmigiano butter; both were nice but not particularly remarkable, probably better to save the carbs for the pasta!  Following that the Cauliflower with Spicy Soppresetta, Sicilian Pesto and Marjoram ($14) was a flavorful and interesting take on a vegetable that can often be left behind - would definitely order this again.  For mains, we sampled four pasta dishes:  Malfaldini, Pink Peppercorn and Parmigiano Reggiano ($19); Pecorino Filled Mezzaluna, Peas, Black Pepper, Lemon ($23); Ricotta Gnocchi, Broccoli Pesto, Basil, Pistachios ($19);  Sheeps Milk Agnolotti, Saffron, Dried Tomato, Honey ($23).  Based on our sampling, it is truly hard to go wrong with any of the pasta choices.  All were flavorful, representative of the season, and delicately prepared.  Finally to conclude, we sampled the Olive Oil Cake ($9), nothing to write home about but nevertheless tasty.  For four people, we found the amount of food to be perfect.  Doing it over, would probably order fewer antipasti (esp with all the accompanying bread), and try out one of the meat courses.BeverageSelected the 2012 Caves Cooperatives de Donnas Nebbiolo from Valle d'Aosta, Italy ($15) available by the glass.  Though the wine was alright, it was served entirely too warm - at or even slightly above room temperature (both glasses).  My wife enjoyed her Aperol Spritz ($13).  Think the wine game needs some improvement to match the caliber of food.Service- Polite, though not very polished.- Limited ability to describe dishes and wines, no real help in providing recommendations or guidance on the menu (i.e. 'everything is good').",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,0,0.5,9.69999980927,"Missy Robbins,polishing,spot,friends,dinner,Lilia,Cauliflower,place,pastas,reputation,vegetable,House Made Mozzarella,vibe,try,value,Brooklyn.,wife,Sheeps Milk Agnolotti,place,garlic bread,lemon zest,bottarga,din,pasta,Polite,Lemon,pasta dishes,one,FoodWe,wine,carbs,parmigiano butter,fish roe,mustard,mains,Peas,pasta choices,any,sampling,season,representative,Atmosphere- Cool,dishes,glass,glasses,Pecorino,meat,Sicilian Pesto,room temperature,Black Pepper,Pink Peppercorn,Broccoli Pesto,Prosciutto,Spicy Soppresetta,Marjoram,Malfaldini,Parmigiano Reggiano,Mezzaluna,Ricotta Gnocchi,wines,everything,Basil, Pistachios,Saffron,Dried Tomato,both,caliber,wine game,guidance,menu,ability,help,All,Italy,Valle d'Aosta,Caves Cooperatives de Donnas Nebbiolo,BeverageSelected,improvement,food,recommendations,food.,bread,nothing,home,people,amount,esp,antipasti,Aperol Spritz,Olive Oil Cake","1,7,7,1,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,7,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,6,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,7,6,6,7,7,1,6,7,6,6,7,6,1,7,1,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,1,7,7,7,6,3","0.087230168283,0.0699205249548,0.0633254796267,0.0584275349975,0.0512204766273,0.0372836627066,0.035863738507,0.0333823263645,0.0329140983522,0.0298304334283,0.0295668579638,0.0284259989858,0.0245129670948,0.0242998246104,0.0242998246104,0.0166194587946,0.0151636376977,0.01287577115,0.0106318332255,0.0106318332255,0.00930423568934,0.00930423568934,0.00930423568934,0.00849639996886,0.00753898266703,0.00714463414624,0.00714463414624,0.00704150320962,0.00692503480241,0.00635779090226,0.00628388114274,0.00628388114274,0.00628388114274,0.00628388114274,0.00625169230625,0.00625169230625,0.00571006489918,0.00571006489918,0.00571006489918,0.005700414069,0.005700414069,0.00551170669496,0.00548661500216,0.00484848767519,0.00484314514324,0.00449716625735,0.00424216687679,0.00424109399319,0.00423749163747,0.00423130579293,0.00423130579293,0.0038720802404,0.00372115848586,0.00371064827777,0.00371064827777,0.00370208290406,0.00370208290406,0.00370208290406,0.00370208290406,0.00367986201309,0.00358675280586,0.00338774267584,0.00338774267584,0.00338774267584,0.00311180530116,0.00292827771045,0.00292827771045,0.00292827771045,0.00292827771045,0.00292827771045,0.00292827771045,0.00282262871042,0.00251149921678,0.00251149921678,0.00251149921678,0.00251149921678,0.00248329574242,0.00234135356732,0.00224374001846,0.00217845174484,0.00212691328488,0.00186549301725,0.00186549301725,0.00186300196219,0.00186300196219,0.00186075142119,0.00186075142119,0.00171312969178,0.00110412144568"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,10235,"Does Lilia live up to the hype? In my opinion, no. Is it still a great restaurant? Yes. Our group had 10pm reservations for a Sunday night, which was the only time I could get when I was booking a month out. This place is very popular! Food: Everything we had was great, but the real stars here are the appetizers.Cacio e pepe fritelle- SO GOOD. Pillowy and delicious, while capturing the flavors of a classic casio e pepe pastaBagna cauda- This is a hot fish dip with vegetables. Which sounds a bit gross, but is actually wonderful. The dip is warm and the crisp variety of vegetables complement it perfectly.Whole artichoke- I love artichokes and this one was cooked perfectly.Cured sardines- Personally am not a fan of sardines, and I still enjoyed this dish. The fatty butter, sour capers, and fishy sardines come together wonderfully. Crispy little fish- These were amazing. They are exactly what they sound like- crispy little fishMalfadini- In reading reviews for Lilia in the papers, I came to think of this as the item to order. And it was very good. The pasta is fresh, the pepper provides a pop without being overwhelming. But, I don't think it's worth waiting a month for a reservation for. Ricotta gnocci- The gnocci themselves were tender and delicious, but I found the sauce a bit too ""green"" tasting and thought it overpowered the delicate gnocciSheeps milk cheese filled agnoloti- Very good, a tad on the sweet side in my opinion. Not particularly exciting. Softserve- for desert, we had the vanilla and chocolate soft serve with various toppings. I thought this was a fun way to end the meal, and allowed for some level of customization. Our table preferred the vanilla to the chocolate.Service:Despite our 10pm reservation, we still had to wait at the bar for a bit.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,11083,"Heard about Lilia a few months ago. I did my research and bumped it to the top or my list of places I need to try asap. The place is beautiful fresh clean and bright. Very welcoming. The hostesses were very nice. We had our youngest with us 7 months old and Giovanna was very accommodating. My son had a little crush on our server Marissa who was great at letting us know the menu. The only problem I had was it was just the wife and I and we couldn't order as much as we would when we go out with our other foodie couple.  Here's what we could almost manage. Cacio e Pepe Fritelle Pure deliciousness! Crispy outside with a doughy cheesy inside. Excellent must get. Prosciutto, Balsamic Mustard, Parmigiano Butter. Comes with really good bread so I mad myself sandwiches lol.  So good. The mustard was awesome. Housemade Mozzarella, Toasted Garlic Bread, Lemon, Bottarga. Not going to lie but all the pictures I've seen online do not do this dish any justice. Great flavors and textures.Whole Artichoke, Garlic, Mint, Parmigiano, Breadcrumbs. Honestly one of the best artichokes I've had in a while. They flatten it on the dish and serve it in warm oil. So good. Most places the artichoke heart isn't really edible. Not here. Devoured it.Rigatoni Diavola, San Marzanos, Chilies, Oregano, Pecorino. I thought this was going to be the best of the three pastas we ordered. It was good but I was wrong.

I got there and they made us wait about 15 minutes for our table because the table we waited for was procrastinating with the bill. We sat down and ordered drinks and some appetizers. We ordered the Sicilian olives which is a must have with a drink. The house mozzarella on garlic toast is delicious. I could have eaten 2 myself but I didn't. The whole artichoke is also delicious. We ordered 3 pastas because that's what everyone raves about. We ordered the malfandini, agnolotti and gnocchi. The malfandini with pecorino and pink peppercorn was good but not great. It lacked salt, not enough to cheese and the pasta was al dente. The sheeps milk stuffed agnolotti was by far my favorite pasta. The pesto gnocchi also lacked salt and I didn't taste  enough pesto.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198892,"I was visiting New York on a general gorging myself with food trip, and was excited to try Lilia because seasonal, rustic Italian food and pasta is something right up my alley. We lined up before the 5:30 opening, and were able with some luck to get a table by 8 PM ( the wait was nbd to me, we walked over to Four Horsemen and shared a bottle of delicious wine to start).I was with three others so we got to order a ton and try a little bit of everything on the menu. The food and atmosphere in general were lovely. I was particularly a fan of the cured sardines on toast, the clams, and the veal steak we had as an entree. The only let down was the service, both at the host stand at the beginning of the night ( I asked a couple of questions about seating, and the hostess just gave me the same line over and over in an annoyed tone). Our server was fine, I found his mandate that we order everything at once annoying, but I get that some restaurants do this, ostensibily to estimate table turn times and to be able to course out the dinner appropriately. Accodingly, it was really surpring to me that all three of the pasta dishes we ordered came out cold. I pointed this out to our server and he responded by saying ""Word. I'll give the chef your feedback."" and walked away. We waited a moment for him to come back to see if he's take our plates away or offer to refire the course, but he disappeared. We were hungry so ended up eating it after a while. Our other courses arrived with no issues.I've worked as a restaurant server for 10 years so I understand the realities of restaurant work. I know that sometimes it's not up to the server to decide whether or not a dish gets comped. But I do know that response was inappropriate, and really surprising given Lilia's profile, popularity, and price point and especially because this place is KNOWN FOR THEIR PASTA.

In a dining landscape where every menu is pockmarked with buzzwords like ""yuzu,"" ""shiso,"" ""shishito peppers,"" ""lovage,"" and complicated unenjoyable dishes, it's satisfying and comforting to see Missy Robbins take a handful of simple ingredients, treat them right, and put out some of the best food I've eaten in recent memory. Lilia is like a symphony in motion with Missy Robbins as the conductor. The incredibly skilled kitchen staff works in perfect harmony, churning out deceptively complex and satisfying dishes that are cooked perfectly and presented at the perfect pace. No pretentious plating to be found, nor excessive luxuries taken here, and it's a wonderful thing. The front of house is equally in tune. My server was excellent, knowledgeable, and I felt very well taken care of. As an aside, the venue is absolutely stunning. The focus and restraint in the food and service is echoed by the beautifully minimalist decor of the restaurant.I wish every restaurant could be like Lilia. Missy Robbins and her staff hide behind nothing here. It's all about great, simple food and excellent service. There are very few restaurants in New York city doing what Lilia is doing right now.

The cafe is tiny, maybe only 4-5 seats, it's really meant to get in and get out. The gal working the cafe was so sweet and friendly. I take half and half in my coffee, so she poored me some milk and cream to get me that half and half experience. Very sweet indeed. Also, this was the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever had, hands down. I returned once more on our last day and picked up 6 cookies to take back with me to SF.

The highs were the mussels and the Agnolotti (top 5 pasta) and the lows were the gnocchi and mafaldini as well as the portion sizes and price points for the portion sizes.Arrived without a reservation on a Saturday at 5:40 and the wait time was 1.5 hours to dine outside. The inside looked trendy and had a cool vibe. Note they do not serve complimentary bread to start (a little pretentious of them, but it is Williamsburg). We order the bread ($12) and it was outstanding (4.5/5). However, the price point on it is criminal and you get two pieces. We shared the cacio e pepe fritelle ($7). You get three small fried balls with a nice balance of cheese inside (4.25/5). My friends thought they could use more cheese, I thought they were perfectly balanced. We shared the mussels ($13) and were a 5/5. The mussels do not come in a pot, but are served more in the same way oysters are served. I thought they were outstanding and some of the best I have had flavor wise (for size of mussels check out Upstate). The Agnolotti, as everyone says, is the reason to come here (5/5). One of the best pastas I have ever had in my life. Everything was perfect from texture to portion size to saffron sauce. Not sure I would trek into Brooklyn and wait 1.5 hours again for this, but I would to try it once. The gnocchi (1/5) may be the worst I have ever had at an Italian restaurant. Very hard. Not soft or pillow like (see Lupa or Hearth). DO NOT order this dish. Mafaldini was fresh and loved the pepper (3.75/5). We were all a bit disappointed in it overall though. It was basically eating seasoned dry pasta.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198924,"I was super excited about my dinner at Lilia, in part because of the positive reviews in NY Mag and partly because I had to get a reservation a full month out, so there was plenty of build-up.Long story short: The food was good for the most part, but nothing that blew my mind. But more importantly, we were made to wait an hour (until 9:30p, on a Monday) for our table EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A RESERVATION. An hour? Because our party of five couldn't be sat anywhere else than the table where people lingered forever and ever? I refuse to believe that was the only option! They comped us two orders of $7 cacio pepe fritelle, which were good, but a round of drinks would have done much more to repair the ill will.The pastas were pretty tasty--we had the rigatoni diavola (good), pasta with wild mushrooms and aged goat cheese (good but boring, and surprisingly oily), and sheep's milk agnolotti with saffron, tomato and honey (surprisingly awesome, in a sweet and savory way).The veal flank steak was tender and lean, but it tasted unpleasant, like pickled meat -- it was topped with an overwhelming amount of pickled hot peppers (the menu didn't indicate that they were pickled) and parsley instead of basil which is what the menu said and is a huge difference when there are only two flavors in the dish. The swordfish was the best dish on our table, light, very fresh tasting. I thought the scallops were a miss. They were grilled and served with a bland yogurt sauce that had way too many walnuts and not enough of any other flavor.The bartender in the back bar was very nice, but the rest of the wait staff was just okay.

We walked in at 6:00 on the dot and were told there were tables outside available - amazing! That did mean that we didn't get to soak up the cool vibe indoors (though I did scope it out on my bathroom visit) but it was worth it to not wait. We ordered the cacio e pepe fritelle, the prosciutto served with mustard and parmesan butter (the butter was the highlight here, not joking), my mom got black bass with salsa verde and I went with the saffron agnolotti, of course. With the exception of the cacio e pepe, which we never received (we could have pointed this out but at this point I was full from prosciutto and butter and hadn't even gotten to my pasta yet) everything was amazing.

Definitely not worth nearly $20. The rigatoni were okay, again well cooked but sauced with a bland, probably jarred tomato sauce.  Though I liked the concept of the mafaldini, the pepper overpowered any other flavors.

Our bill after tip, tax and wine for two was $200, which we felt was too high for the quality of the food.The squid was a pleasant dish - it wasn't innovative, but it was tender and with a good tomato sauce - and I also liked the agnolotti. But the rest of the dishes that we ordered were pretty big disappointments. The scallops and gnocchi were bland, the mushrooms were a combination of flavors that didn't compliment one another, and the lamb was tough rather than tender. The chocolate torta was also very dry.There is a Sommelier if you're into that, but it seemed like he didn't help everyone - if you know what I'm getting at. Which is dissimilar to other top-rated restaurants in the area.Overall the restaurant is over-hyped. From articles and overhearing the management talk, it's created and managed by manhattanites - which explains why it's trendy without very good food and with high prices. I overheard one of the managers explain to another manhattanite / friend who was dining there say about the area, ""no, I don't think I have come across a lot of people who do drugs...""Despite all of the above, I was originally going to give this restaurant three stars for the service (nice servers and great front of house staff), but about 4 hours after dinner my partner and I started feeling really sick.

The clams were just as tasty as they are beautiful; the chili sauce had a slightly sweet and tangy kick to it with a good amount of heat. I would love to eat mounds of these while relaxing on some tropical beach, tanned men bringing me tray after tray of clams. The bagna cauda was ordered mainly out of curiosity, and while it was tasty, it just couldn't compare to the clams and probably wouldn't be appreciated by anyone who can't tolerate a strong fishy flavor. For pastas, we chose the mafaldini and sheeps milk cheese agnolotti. Both were excellent. I have to disagree with other reviews mentioning them being served at room temp or tasting too salty. Both pastas came out hot and perfectly seasoned. The mafaldini was just fun to eat. The shape of the noodles and relatively simple preparation made for a comforting dish that I could eat any time. Like at 2 am when I can't sleep because random thoughts of food enter my mind. The agnolotti surprised me - I wasn't sure how saffron and honey would play in a pasta dish, but I loved how the creamy cheese complimented the sweetness of the honey and the elusive flavor of the saffron (seriously, can anyone put into words what that flavor is?). The service throughout the meal was fine; I did have to get the server's attention to order and to get the check. Not particularly memorable or impressive, but overall I thought they were friendly and accommodating. We didn't try any entrees this time, and I would come back to try the rest of the menu in a heartbeat if it weren't for the wait! And the fact that I'll probably just want more pasta when I return.",4.0 star rating,"Brooklyn, NY",3,0,0.300000011921,14.8000001907,"reviews,some,food,judgment,bagna cauda,Lilia,clams,confirmation text,reservation,whim,clams,anyone,reviews,Resy,server,interior,meal,wood,wood ceiling,hostess,gift,everyone,ovens,smell,pastas,pastas,past.As,flavor,mafaldini,chili,bagna cauda,tray,chili sauce,mafaldini,milk cheese agnolotti,flavor,men,service,winter vegetables,breadcrumbs,kick,heat,amount,beach,mounds,curiosity,tray,sheeps,room temp,noodles,shape,check,attention,dish,rest,flavor,server,anyone,entrees,creamy cheese,honey,saffron,meal,sweetness,words,order,pasta,Calabrian,menu,heartbeat,wait,fact,Both,thoughts,food,pasta dish,honey,agnolotti,saffron,preparation,mind","5,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,4,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7","0.0680589899421,0.0680589899421,0.0655522719026,0.0596454404294,0.043355230242,0.0354777760804,0.0330034121871,0.0296116340905,0.0285122916102,0.0285122916102,0.0256765279919,0.0210186820477,0.0191697347909,0.0169135387987,0.0135164810345,0.0132428528741,0.0124679710716,0.0123242251575,0.0112021332607,0.0110357189551,0.0108546456322,0.0108151845634,0.0107846753672,0.0107846753672,0.0104630263522,0.00948652904481,0.00919855479151,0.00908250641078,0.00897711794823,0.00830410979688,0.00830410979688,0.00827390421182,0.00772602064535,0.00755044165999,0.00755044165999,0.00754557503387,0.00751999439672,0.00735146319494,0.00726597756147,0.00726597756147,0.00725180096924,0.00725180096924,0.00725180096924,0.00723954290152,0.00723954290152,0.00722874794155,0.00710704782978,0.00660639675334,0.00659115193412,0.00657254178077,0.00657254178077,0.00631277589127,0.00631277589127,0.00627526920289,0.00620963005349,0.00616095634177,0.00615649530664,0.00604650285095,0.00562479207292,0.00560377398506,0.00560377398506,0.00560377398506,0.00559971574694,0.00529028614983,0.00490287039429,0.00489931926131,0.00486280117184,0.00430224556476,0.00338752707466,0.00338752707466,0.00338752707466,0.00338543206453,0.00326687679626,0.00253771897405,0.00245983386412,0.0024579432793,0.0024579432793,0.0024579432793,0.002366181463,0.00215374748223,0.00215198518708"

While it was kind of fatty, the meat was seasoned nicely and had a good flavor. The potatoes that accompanied the steak were also quite good.Wish I could say the same for the bass we also ordered.  The fish itself wasn't bad but the green sauce they smothered it on top with was not enjoyable.Lastly we ordered lattes and a piece of the chocolate torta to share. Had I realized it was just a piece of flourless cake with a bit of espresso sauce, I wouldn't have ordered it.  The coffees were not to my liking as well.This dinner with tip and tax for the 3 of us came to $275.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should have stuck to the pastas.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,101795,"I've been dying to come here ever since the hype, and I finally made it all the way to Williamsburg this past Tuesday. We arrived at around 6:50pm and were told that the dining room was entirely booked, but it would be about a 45 minute wait for the bar. Since I was expecting a much longer wait after everything I've read, I was pretty pleased with this. We started taking a walk around a very nice park nearby, but less than 15 (or 20?) minutes later, we already received a text that our two bar seats were ready. Unfortunately, we didn't get to actually sit in those seats--there was a mix-up because they offered the seats to the guy in front of us on the waiting list, but his dining companion hadn't arrived, so they texted us instead. Apparently she arrived shortly after we reappeared, because after showing us the promised seats and saying we could sit once they threw down table settings, they ended up giving the seats to the other couple instead. So we had to wait around for the next two seats to open...which I suppose is a genuine mix-up, and they were apologetic, but somewhat annoying all the same. As for the food, the reason I wanted to come was the very hyped up malfadini and the cacio e pepe fritters. i ended up liking them well enough--the pasta was cooked very well, the fritters were soft and fluffy--but I would never order them again. I love pepper, but these were so over-peppered that the flavors of each dish were completely overpowered. It was a pretty flat disappointment, for me. However, I did like the sheep's milk agnolotti even though I don't typically go for ravioli-type pastas. The slightly honey sweet sauce was perfect for the sheep's milk filling. To finish, the olive oil cake was perfectly fine, but what really made it special was that ridiculously creamy dollop of whipped cream on top.Overall, Lilia was fine, but I probably wouldn't make the trek to eat there again. It's definitely one of the pitfalls of hype...lots of customers, but lots of high expectations to meet. I will say, though, that I didn't have any issues with the waitstaff. They were fairly nice.

My fiancé went up to the hostess just to see if there's any chance to get a table (fully assuming they'd say no). The hostess actually squeezed us in! However we did have a cut off time where the table was booked for another reservation. We figured 1.5 hours was just fine, given we had the serendipitous opportunity to nab a table on Valentine's weekend! We were able to get 2 appetizers and entrees plus dessert very comfortably within that time! While we would have loved to linger and have more drinks, the entire meal was perfect.

At no point was our water not filled or a napkin not folded.Now let's talk food.We ordered grilled spring onions, escarole, sardines,clams, rigatoni and sea bass. My family and I were in agreement that ever dish was an overkill/over sauced for the most part.I love grilled young onions. I mean who doesn't right. I am not saying they were not tasty but they stand on their own. There is no reason to submerge them in dressing.Escarole a classic Italian item. They put their flare on it with anchovies and vinegar. But the plate of oil that they sat in took away from the simple elegance of escarole.Giant white beautiful sardines on a crispy piece of bread with dill. Nice right? The tablespoons of butter that blanketed the oiled bread was not necessary and ruined the dish.The clams were good. Too me they were a better version of clam oreganata. The rigatoni was cooked just right, good use of fragrant peppercorn and spice.The pesce was cooked perfectly but was smothered in salsa verde.The decorThe room was pretty and filled with a hip crowd.

Overall, for the quality of the food which was very fresh and highly flavorful (served in modest portions, which was great) was delicious. I would happily return.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,3541,"I would like to start this review by saying, if this was based on the food alone, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars. Our server's attitude and pushy behavior is what brought my rating down to 4 stars.The first time my husband and I came here, we came on a Saturday night at 6PM (which we thought was pretty early) after a yoga class around the corner. We did not have a reservation, but there were 2 of us and we thought it was early. Worse comes to worse, we thought we could wait at the bar. When we entered, the place was packed. The host told us that there were no tables available for the whole night and counter service had a wait of 2 hours. What!? So we left and made a reservation as soon as we got home. This is one of those restaurants that is not on OpenTable but is on Resy, which I hate. Resy does not benefit the customer in any way what so ever, where as OpenTable gives you points for every reservation that can go towards a gift certificate that can be used at restaurants. I wish Lilia would reconsider and put themselves on OpenTable. We made our reservation for a month and a half away from the date when we tried to get in because that was the soonest one available! On our second try, we were seated right away. Lesson learned: always make a reservation!When we were seated, we were handed menus and drink menus. Neither my husband and I were in the mood for an alcoholic beverage so we just asked for tap water. Our server then replied with, ""Are you sure? No wine or beer or a cocktail?"" We said no. His displeasure was palpable. He then went on to ask (with obvious annoyance and attitude), ""Soda or anything else?"" We said we were going to stick with water. He actually HUFFED and walked away briskly. Meanwhile, the server who filled our waters and continually refilled our waters could not have been more lovely. He was chatty, funny, and just sweet. Great service from him.Once we settled on what we wanted to order, we waited patiently for the server to come back and take our order. We had to wait 20 minutes for him to come back. It was obvious that because we did not order booze to increase our bill ( and therefore his tip), we were not his priority. He finally came back and told us the specials, most of which included truffles. My husband asked about the fondue appetizer special with the truffles but it was $45, which was more than any entree and a smaller portion. Truffles are expensive, we get it. No complaint about the price there, but at the same time not what we wanted to spend our money on. We instead ordered the burrata appetizer on garlic bread to share.  Our server languidly asked us if we wanted to get another appetizer because they are ""very small."" We said no and he audibly sighed. We ordered the famous Mafaldini and the Agnolotti with saffron. The server asked, ""Are you sure you don't want anything else?"" We said no, again, and he left. I have honestly never experienced such rudeness from a server.The burrata was absolutely amazing. Fresh delicious burrata topped amazing garlic bread with small sprinkles of lemon rind on top. Really delicious. Such a burst of flavor. The Mafaldini lives up to hype. It was a fresh take on the traditional cacio e Pepe with pink peppercorns. The peppercorns complemented the cheese and the pasta beautifully. The Angnolotti a MUST when you come here. The flavors in this dish are just outstanding. The subtle nuttiness of the cheese pairs perfectly with the burst of flavor from the saffron in the sauce. Absolutely stunning. I could have eaten 3 more bowls of each of these dishes.The desserts just didn't appeal to us so we skipped them, which angered our server to no end. God he was just so rude. The food here is unreal. I would absolutely come back for the food, but this server needs to check his attitude next time he comes to work. It was obvious we made him angry because we didn't have a big enough bill in his eyes. I understand everyone has an off day and everyone is entitled to that but this really put a damper on our evening. It did not need to happen. As an adult and someone who works in the service industry you need to realize when you are going to far and being rude and change your attitude around.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,198775,"Lilia is a wonderful place to go in Williamsburg when you want to impress someone. Whether it be coworker, boss, date, or parents. It has great food, nice environment and caring service. It is a former auto shop turned restaurant, giving a youthful but elegant vibe. You should arrive early (6pm) for walk in and get a table inside. Outside tables were not that worth it. Every dish was tasty. For antipasti, I got roasted cauliflowers.

I am a huge foodie, own 3 restaurants, & i was SUPER EXCITED to try this place after all the hype and reviews. First of all, my parents are both Sicilian straight off the boat, and my mother cooks killer Sicilian food all of the time. So im not sure if it's my high standards, but my entire meal was NOT impressive at all. My boyfriend and I drove 40 minutes from Jersey City to Brooklyn last night for this meal, which I could not wait for. We ordered the Cacio e Pepe fritelle, roasted mushrooms, grilled clams, grilled blowfish tails, Malfaldini, & the Agnelotti. The best thing about my meal was dipping bread (which I had to ask for) into the olive oil which the grilled blowfish was in. Seriously so disappointed. The malfaldini tasted like straight pepper & ONLY pepper, as well as the Cacio e Pepe fritelle. So bland, besides the extreme amount of pepper which was all you tasted. I also paid $11 PER GLASS for each glass of Moscato, which was the tiniest wine glass I have ever seen, probably 2 sips of each was all it took to finish. I cannot believe all of the positive reviews on this place. I can cook better Italian food at my house!! 30 day wait to get a reservation?? Makes me so mad.

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199297,"I've gotta weigh in on this vaunted establishment and bring the dialog back down the critical path.  The best I can say for my experience is that the decor and crowd are lovely, the wine selection great and we found a ""to die for"" dessert: the lemon ice.  But those things alone don't offset what we found to be a low-value proposition that started with the wine and made its way through appetizers and small plates (we didn't bother with the larger plates since we wanted to graze).  By low-value proposition I mean the prices were fine, but the portions terribly skimpy.  But feel free to see this from the other end of the telescope and consider it a surprisingly pricey place to eat because if you walk in with an appetite, you're walking out with a considerably lighter wallet.So, on to the experience.  Our waitress displayed the warmth of someone who has just learned that a cat has deposited a dead bird on the doorstep.  We wanted to give her an appetizer order so we'd have something on which to nibble as we perused the numerous small plate possibilities, all of which seemed enchanting.  She strongly resisted this idea, telling us the restaurant prefers we order everything at the same time and made it clear it would be our fault, not hers or theirs, if things ordered later took a fortnight to come out of the kitchen.  Fortunately, timing was not an issue.  While she had the good sense to inquire about our meal once it was done, she didn't bother to ask about our experience when we started eating or even before we finished.  Moreover, rather than seeking to address some negative comments, she listened and then clearly ignored the critique, as if she hadn't heard it.Wine service was proper but the quartino we ordered turned out to hold considerably less than the stand one-third of a bottle (although priced as if it would hold half a bottle).  We were so frustrated with the size of the net pour to each of our glasses that we decided to forego additional glasses of wine once the few precious sips had been taken to empty our glasses.We started our meal with the Cacio e Pepe Fritelle.  Somehow they managed, by poor use of the deep fryer, to turn this traditional, lusciously moist and simple pasta and pecorino dish into a dried ball of fried dough.  I think they'd do much better just rolling it once in powdered sugar and selling it out of a truck at a street festival as a substitute for zeppole.  We ate about half the dish and, true to her lack of concern with our experience, our waitress cleared the little fried dough balls without comment.We next turned to the roasted cauliflower and clams.The former, intended to be seasoned with spicy soppressata, Sicilian pesto and majoram, was well cooked but under-seasoned.  The flavor of majoram didn't come through at all, and they sprinkled little bits of soppressata on the bottom of the bowl like it was some terribly expensive, rare earth element.  For the price I'd have expected at least half a head of cauliflower, but after the disappointing wine pour was not surprised that four bites or so did in the entire dish.  In contrast to the vegetable, the grilled clams featuring Calabrian chili were horribly over-seasoned, so much so that the heavy-handed application of the chili made both of us choke at first (take a look at the picture of the clams - would you really want to dump that much chili into your mouth?).  Quite disappointed at that point that we'd already, so quickly, drained our glasses of wine.  Again, the price would have been fair for a couple dozen clams.  For the dozen served, we felt short-changed.Our last dish before calling it quits on the place was roasted trumpet mushrooms.  I'd give this dish a 9 out of 10 for flavor, but again was shocked by the small size of the portion (four or five thinly-sliced pieces of mushroom) and appalled that they set it up on just a few sprigs of arugula.  At this price, an arugula salad bowl topped with the mushrooms would have made more sense.Was the meal a disaster?  Not really.  But given the skimpy portion sizes with execution flaws and unconcerned waitstaff, I won't be back.",2.0 star rating,"New York, NY",5,0,-0.300000011921,14.8000001907,"proposition,wine selection,path,establishment,waitress,dialog,experience,wine,experience,plates,plates,appetizers,sense,things,something,crowd,dessert,lemon ice,way,earth element,decor,size,restaurant,someone,plate possibilities,bottle,experience,place,portions,appetite,bottle,dish,proposition,wine,telescope,end,bird,doorstep,cat,warmth,price,glasses.,glasses,glasses,dish,things,dozen,meal,meal,fault,timing,Wine service,soppressata,fortnight,issue,appetizer order,all,fried dough,ball,fried dough balls,wine,everything,idea,hers,kitchen,quartino,critique,comments,sips,each,net,dish,glasses,pecorino,pasta,fryer,use,zeppole,substitute,sugar,truck,street festival,concern,lack,wallet.So,prices,chili,clams,chili,clams,look,application,meal,dish,mouth,picture,both,point,chili,sense.,price,trumpet mushrooms,mushroom,portion,size,mushrooms,waitstaff,portion sizes,arugula salad bowl,Cacio e Pepe Fritelle,place,flavor,arugula,disaster,sprigs,pieces,execution flaws,wine,dish,price,Calabrian,bottom,clams,former,head,cauliflower,majoram,majoram,bowl,cauliflower,pesto,bits,bites,vegetable,contrast,Sicilian","7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,1,7,6,7,7,5,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,6,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,4,7,5,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,2","0.125328212976,0.0751607939601,0.031047038734,0.031047038734,0.0300448909402,0.0266883857548,0.0234321691096,0.0222182869911,0.0199965368956,0.0184883140028,0.0184883140028,0.0184883140028,0.0178279113024,0.016820654273,0.0161860901862,0.0147972833365,0.0147972833365,0.0147972833365,0.0147216003388,0.0139669813216,0.0138904917985,0.0119392201304,0.0116974823177,0.0109565434977,0.00956898462027,0.00951700937003,0.00755639001727,0.00734113063663,0.00704081449658,0.00702093821019,0.00669191312045,0.00666266446933,0.00640422478318,0.00563709018752,0.00558756198734,0.00558756198734,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00557466642931,0.00540900416672,0.0050454926677,0.0050454926677,0.0050454926677,0.00488919019699,0.00480360956863,0.00474520632997,0.00469862204045,0.00468777585775,0.00459270784631,0.00447105709463,0.00445969821885,0.00431500468403,0.00414979225025,0.00398897053674,0.00395128829405,0.00395128829405,0.00389770721085,0.00389770721085,0.0038906421978,0.00383157725446,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00374955451116,0.00373444659635,0.00373444659635,0.00373444659635,0.00373032921925,0.00373032921925,0.00373032921925,0.00363712757826,0.00342931621708,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00341006205417,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340685923584,0.00340388040058,0.00340388040058,0.00330806523561,0.00328287784941,0.00318828597665,0.00318828597665,0.00318828597665,0.00318402936682,0.00295389792882,0.00266893184744,0.00262784794904,0.00256569799967,0.00253692385741,0.00253692385741,0.00253692385741,0.00253518507816,0.00241210917011,0.00239003705792,0.00236835656688,0.00234710425138,0.00220159045421,0.00220159045421,0.00220159045421,0.00220034969971,0.00219802395441,0.00219802395441,0.00210535363294,0.00202054018155,0.00200351863168,0.00200233678333,0.00200233678333,0.00186536798719,0.00175172882155,0.00175172882155,0.00174889084883,0.0016826846404,0.00159927911591,0.00150594976731,0.00150153925642,0.00140017736703,0.00138046417851,0.0013316256227,0.0012798680691,0.0012744772248,0.0012744772248,0.00127343425993,0.00127343425993,0.00127245532349,0.00111494353041,0.00111403106712,0.0011131745996,0.001112367725,0.001112367725,0.000659819343127"

One of the better Italian restaurants I have dined at and right up there with L'Artusi for me. We started off with an order of the Cacio E Pepe Fritelle and the Whole Artichoke which was phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend these dishes, especially the artichoke. Seasoned artichoke leaves with excellent flavor and a broth to dip them in. Great for 2-3 people. As for mains we went with an order of the Rigatoni Diavola, Mafaldini and Futtucine which were each very delicious. If you can only order one, go with the Mafaldini. As for dessert, we went with the chocolate gelato and olive oil cake - each superb.Unfortunately, our service was quite poor, having a miserable and completely disinterested server, who rudely told us we did not order enough, yet we left completely stuffed.

He was just superb. He knew the menu extremely well an took the time to make recommendations. So if you stumble in his name is Babacar . So ask for him upon your entry .

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,97731,"Lovely experience. Simple, unpretentious, classic Italian flavors that were strong but refined. We had the trumpet mushrooms, artichoke, scallops, veal, mafaldini and pappardelle. Finished it off with olive oil cake which was fantastic- moist and dense with a caramelized crust. Everything was delicious, although the artichokes weren't anything special. The highlight of the meal was, unsurprisingly, the pasta- what Missy Robbins does best. The texture was perfect. The mafaldini was hearty and lemony, peppery and buttery. The pappardelle was delicate with the most gorgeous, meaty sauce. However, the appetizers are the weakest part of the menu. I'd suggest skipping those (or going for classics like the gem lettuce and fennel) and ordering pasta, fish and meat dishes. The plates are definitely on the small side. Maybe we eat a lot, but our order was sufficient for two people, with room for maybe even another main.Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The place is huge and beautiful. Ambient lighting, high ceilings and an open kitchen where you can watch the action. There are also more private, enclosed seating areas in the back and behind the hostess stand. Great place for a date! Only one hiccup: when we came for our reservation, the restaurant still had plenty of open tables, but we still had to wait 15 min to be seated.

From reading other reviews and my own experience, what is stopping Lilia from propelling itself into 5 star territory is the service. Consider this more like a 4.5.First, if you haven't read Pete Wells' review, do. I had already been pining to check Lilia out, but reading Petey's poetic words about the food here was enough to make me actually salivate at my computer screen. ""Stab an agnolotto, bring a parcel of sheep's milk ricotta and feta in gorgeously supple yellow dough to your mouth. "" Who doesn't want an agnolotto right now?? Upon reading that review, I thought, oh shiz, it's going to be even harder to get a table. So I immediately snagged a res at semi-senior citizen hour of 6 pm for a girls night out, which meant i had to sneak out of the office at 5:30 on a weeknight to trek to Williamsburg.Not one to argue with Mr. Wells, we did as he recommended and ordered the pasta, along with some starters:Cacio e Pepe Fritelle - basically donuts filled with mac and cheese... how could you notHousemade Mozarella, Toasted Garlic Bread, Lemon, Bottarga - sounds so simple but it is TO DIE... get itGrilled Clams, Calabrian Chili, Breadcrumbs - duh, super photogenic and deliciousWhole Artichoke, Garlic, Mint, Parmigiano, Breadcrumbs - this is good, i wouldn't say mindblowing, but also an easy thing to get so you have something to nibble on while you chat with your girls. The broth was on point... I sadly had nothing to sop it up with as there is no bread service (still very confused as to why this is the case)Everyone was adamant on not sharing pastas. I ordered the malfaldini. I sampled the aforementioned agnolotti on my friend's plate, and it was really good, but I still preferred my malfaldini and was glad I didn't have to share it. Other friends got the gnocchi, which I didn't taste only because it looked like a sad portion. They commented on this themselves, so I didn't want to take any away from them. I'll also add that they were surprised it filled them up in the end, and they enjoyed the lighter fresh flavors.But no really guys, I'm still thinking about that malfaldini today. Don't do yourself a disservice, and get it.For dessert, olive oil cake and chocolate torte, and didn't regret either decision.So here's the bad, the service is as pretentious as they say. The one good I'll give them is that they didn't do that thing where they make you wait for your whole party to arrive before they seat you, even if you have a reservation. I really really hate that. However, our server seemed to have a perpetual expression of disdain. We tried to order our starters first because we knew what we wanted, and needed a few more minutes on mains, but were told they preferred to put the whole order in at one time.  Why... whyyyyyy. Can someone in the industry explain this to me? Then we were trying to decide whether to get 2 orders of the fritelle, since it comes 3 to an order, and we were a table of 4. I feel like great service, which I've experienced elsewhere, would be for the server to notice this on his own, and have the kitchen make 4. No big deal, right? If you want to charge me more, I would even be ok if you said, ""hey, they come in an order of 3, I can ask the kitchen to make 4 but they may charge a little extra."" Anyway, we decided on one order since we had so many other dishes, and I made a little joke, ""unless he wanted to throw in an extra piece."" He gave me a fake smile and said, ""sorry, I can't do that."" LAME. Overall, it was just not outstanding service, which didn't jive with how inviting and warm the food made us feel.  On our way out, I also literally ran into our server, and we did one of those dances where we kept trying to get out of each other's way, but kept going the same way. I swear, I caught an eye roll, even as I apologized (no such apology from him).So Lilia, you may not care because your food is great and you've still got customers lined up a month out, but on the off chance you really want to make dining at your establishment a really over-the-top excellent experience, please please have a talk with your waitstaff.",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,12.3999996185,"bread service,friends,Pete Wells,food,review,service,stars,reviews,review,words,food,agnolotto,experience,star territory,First,computer screen,milk ricotta,sheep,feta,Calabrian Chili,Lilia,parcel,thing,res,Garlic,plate,service,nothing,Petey,starters,party,table,starters,gnocchi,agnolotto,service,pasta,server,dough,mouth,shiz,office,girls night out,weeknight,mac,cheese,citizen,service,Breadcrumbs,pastas,malfaldini,agnolotti,malfaldini,Cacio e Pepe Fritelle,broth,Everyone,dances,olive oil cake,girls,something,thing,malfaldini,friend,disservice,good,donuts,Lemon,Mint,Parmigiano,portion,guys,end,order,order,food,chocolate torte,dessert,reservation,expression,disdain,Williamsburg.,food,kitchen,server,itGrilled Clams,deliciousWhole Artichoke,joke,piece,dishes,smile,one,each other,decision.So,notHousemade Mozarella,Bottarga,way,way,way,orders,server,waitstaff,chance,customers,apology,eye roll,establishment,talk,order,order,experience,dining,fritelle,table,kitchen,mains,whyyyyyy,industry,elsewhere,deal,someone","7,1,1,7,5,7,1,5,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,1,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,1","0.0738077685237,0.0615059956908,0.0546691678464,0.0425140336156,0.0343441516161,0.0304788630456,0.0302531179041,0.025515248999,0.0253849495202,0.0201426018029,0.0200977288187,0.0186238121241,0.0171404797584,0.0150005389005,0.0149237802252,0.0148695567623,0.0148276332766,0.0148276332766,0.0148276332766,0.0142725724727,0.0136876171455,0.0127384681255,0.0124394744635,0.0121610276401,0.0115764243528,0.0115013262257,0.0113839367405,0.0110340751708,0.0100674908608,0.00954932905734,0.00877667311579,0.00830337684602,0.0076129375957,0.00710011320189,0.00709918513894,0.00693059666082,0.00643368344754,0.00593987293541,0.00566264241934,0.00566264241934,0.0056385435164,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00540612637997,0.00513954972848,0.00497893150896,0.00475587230176,0.00475062895566,0.00475062895566,0.0046655908227,0.00453097280115,0.00452492479235,0.00450625736266,0.00444137537852,0.00434310687706,0.00434310687706,0.00434310687706,0.004334917292,0.00432083802298,0.00427561951801,0.00421850895509,0.00404840521514,0.00379971391521,0.00379971391521,0.00379971391521,0.00377639429644,0.00376954837702,0.00376954837702,0.00367580167949,0.00367404310964,0.00363485375419,0.00344655569643,0.00344655569643,0.00344390701503,0.0034390531946,0.0034390531946,0.00333235110156,0.00292757060379,0.0029248308856,0.00290221930481,0.00289846840315,0.00275510083884,0.00255757570267,0.00255757570267,0.00255757570267,0.00255639618263,0.00253901700489,0.00239086453803,0.0023753689602,0.00224909395911,0.00224909395911,0.00222124857828,0.00222124857828,0.00222124857828,0.00208054250106,0.00184434233233,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00161722442135,0.00161435978953,0.00156690482982,0.0013707682956,0.00128444028087,0.00128444028087,0.00128374702763,0.00112564757001,0.00112495105714,0.00112428737339,0.00112304696813,0.00112246559002,0.000935877556913"

The service was well organized and I can say that they went above and beyond to accommodate us even when we ordered bread which they don't offer it on the menu, as we found out after the fact. It's also very pretty and although bigger than your average Williamsburg restaurant, it manages to look both cozy and romantic. I'm taking a star away for one reason:Portion size.  My boyfriend ordered gnocchi with fresh pesto. It was absolutely divine, but the portion was appetizer size and that left my bf pushing the food around awkwardly so he won't  finish it in 2 seconds flat. It also left him hungry. My tuna steak was a good size, except the side dish that accompanied  it was also ridiculously small. Half a sun-choke and few more, I forget what, but equally small stuff, come on!Mid-dinner we asked for bread and no matter how long we tried to wait, we finished both our dinners, before the bread actually came out. We go out a lot and I can say we both understand the artsy side of food, but there is no reason to make a pasta dish as small. It's dinner! Based on that aspect, I would've probably given this place three stars, if the food was not utterly delicious and made with so much love.  Will try again and report back.

It was a birthday celebration and we had made reservations for 8:30. We arrived slightly early at 8:15 and sat at the bar. Our table wasn't ready until 8:45 but they were gracious about it. From there, the service went entirely  downhill. Our waiter was distracted and disinterested. He even seemed bored when we asked his favorites from the menu. We ordered a bottle of wine (without any help from him although we asked) and it took him over 10 minutes to arrive with it.  He didn't check in throughout our meal and finding him to get our check again took 10 minutes.  I'm not uptight when it comes to service but we you are paying a premium and celebrating a special occasion you want to enjoy yourself.

I've now been twice, and both times have had questionable experiences with service. My first time, we had a waiter who was less than friendly, and ordered an escarole dish that was so salty it was basically inedible. We barely touched it, and when we told the waiter, he didn't even apologize - he basically did nothing. Didn't offer to bring us something else, take it off the bill, comp something, nothing - for such a ""hot spot"" and not a cheap spot either, this rubbed me the wrong way. But I came back, because I liked the food and ambience and thought it was just our waiter. This time, while once again I had a reservation at 8:30 on a Wednesday, they made us wait 30 minutes for our table because ""we were a little ahead of them"" - whatever that means. And if I hadn't gone and asked another hostess (who looked more in charge) I don't think I would have been seated - I'm pretty positive they just forgot us. Fine. Barely received an apology, didn't offer to comp us anything again - which, by the way, the night before I went to Barbuto and was given free prosecco and dessert for having to wait for my reserved table when it was actually my fault for changing the reservation number. Here, when I showed up on time, I barely got an ""I'm sorry"" from anyone for something that was their fault. Then while my waitress was so sweet this time, our dinner took well over 2 hours - we waited almost 45 minutes for our entrees. Once again, I think they forgot about us, as I saw a runner legit RUN across the restaurant and come back with our food that looked a little like it sat under the lights too long though fortunately was still delicious. And once again, no apology from the waitress, didn't even comment at any point that we we waited for our table and now our food for almost 45 minutes. Not the type of service I would expect for a restaurant getting such high praise. While I love the food, ambience, and wine list, after 2 experiences with the service I just think I would rather go somewhere else that has equal or better food (I think the food is great but you can find just as great Italian food elsewhere - like barbuto for that matter) and treats its customers' time with more respect and acknowledges issues in the kitchen like other restaurants do - with apologies, offers for different food, comped dessert, whatever it might be. Just an I'm sorry would have helped - but no. Better service and equally tasty food can definitely be found elsewhere.",3.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",3,0,-0.20000000298,13.1999998093,"waiter,escarole dish,food,service,wine selection,food,table,something,service,times,stars,service,waiter,Yelp,something,experiences,food,hostess,food,nothing,spot,spot,way,dessert,something,waitress,bill,apology,table,food,food,ambience,whatever,reservation,dessert,way,dinner,charge,Fine,anything,apology,reservation number,anyone,entrees,restaurant,barbuto,food,food,food,experiences,ambience,point,prosecco,type,praise,somewhere,wine list,Barbuto,service,elsewhere,restaurants,apologies,whatever,matter,customers,respect,issues,kitchen,waitress,Italian,restaurant,table,little,RUN,runner,lights","1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,2,2,7,7,7,1,7","0.176143050194,0.116377912462,0.0729675367475,0.0491126328707,0.0419639199972,0.0404987148941,0.0387719087303,0.0387255772948,0.0309795904905,0.0263217538595,0.0244432538748,0.023498242721,0.0221323352307,0.0203982833773,0.0197820533067,0.0187211092561,0.0116578536108,0.0109947798774,0.00750305410475,0.00709863798693,0.00707860849798,0.00707860849798,0.00707860849798,0.00695793889463,0.00668479176238,0.00649013882503,0.00619391864166,0.0053426399827,0.00523255672306,0.00513242324814,0.00494099641219,0.00476873712614,0.00475943181664,0.00475943181664,0.00473796948791,0.00473796948791,0.00424206349999,0.00415719952434,0.00415099831298,0.00414545927197,0.0039248559624,0.00379351759329,0.0037889375817,0.00378476106562,0.00354328402318,0.0035189227201,0.00342133594677,0.00342133594677,0.00341623160057,0.00322012254037,0.00322012254037,0.00315533578396,0.00294398027472,0.00281957746483,0.00281957746483,0.00281727127731,0.00281727127731,0.00280520948581,0.00279755704105,0.0026343697682,0.00245119072497,0.00245119072497,0.00222939136438,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.00195041415282,0.0017778952606,0.00166763924062,0.00155685341451,0.00155539077241,0.00141594582237,0.00123872316908,0.00123872316908,0.00123872316908"

Food and drink delivery was well timed without being rushed. As many have mentioned, the pasta is what stands out. We had two decent cocktails, the cauliflower (a touch too much vinegar), scallops, bass (rather than put the salsa verde beneath the fish, they poured it over the top causing the crisped skin to turn gooey), and spahetti (the star item of the meal).

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,199220,"I really really want to give this 5 stars, and if it was all about the food, I would. From reading other reviews and my own experience, what is stopping Lilia from propelling itself into 5 star territory is the service. Consider this more like a 4.5.First, if you haven't read Pete Wells' review, do. I had already been pining to check Lilia out, but reading Petey's poetic words about the food here was enough to make me actually salivate at my computer screen. ""Stab an agnolotto, bring a parcel of sheep's milk ricotta and feta in gorgeously supple yellow dough to your mouth. "" Who doesn't want an agnolotto right now?? Upon reading that review, I thought, oh shiz, it's going to be even harder to get a table. So I immediately snagged a res at semi-senior citizen hour of 6 pm for a girls night out, which meant i had to sneak out of the office at 5:30 on a weeknight to trek to Williamsburg.Not one to argue with Mr. Wells, we did as he recommended and ordered the pasta, along with some starters:Cacio e Pepe Fritelle - basically donuts filled with mac and cheese... how could you notHousemade Mozarella, Toasted Garlic Bread, Lemon, Bottarga - sounds so simple but it is TO DIE... get itGrilled Clams, Calabrian Chili, Breadcrumbs - duh, super photogenic and deliciousWhole Artichoke, Garlic, Mint, Parmigiano, Breadcrumbs - this is good, i wouldn't say mindblowing, but also an easy thing to get so you have something to nibble on while you chat with your girls. The broth was on point... I sadly had nothing to sop it up with as there is no bread service (still very confused as to why this is the case)Everyone was adamant on not sharing pastas. I ordered the malfaldini. I sampled the aforementioned agnolotti on my friend's plate, and it was really good, but I still preferred my malfaldini and was glad I didn't have to share it. Other friends got the gnocchi, which I didn't taste only because it looked like a sad portion. They commented on this themselves, so I didn't want to take any away from them. I'll also add that they were surprised it filled them up in the end, and they enjoyed the lighter fresh flavors.But no really guys, I'm still thinking about that malfaldini today. Don't do yourself a disservice, and get it.For dessert, olive oil cake and chocolate torte, and didn't regret either decision.So here's the bad, the service is as pretentious as they say. The one good I'll give them is that they didn't do that thing where they make you wait for your whole party to arrive before they seat you, even if you have a reservation. I really really hate that. However, our server seemed to have a perpetual expression of disdain. We tried to order our starters first because we knew what we wanted, and needed a few more minutes on mains, but were told they preferred to put the whole order in at one time.  Why... whyyyyyy. Can someone in the industry explain this to me? Then we were trying to decide whether to get 2 orders of the fritelle, since it comes 3 to an order, and we were a table of 4. I feel like great service, which I've experienced elsewhere, would be for the server to notice this on his own, and have the kitchen make 4. No big deal, right? If you want to charge me more, I would even be ok if you said, ""hey, they come in an order of 3, I can ask the kitchen to make 4 but they may charge a little extra."" Anyway, we decided on one order since we had so many other dishes, and I made a little joke, ""unless he wanted to throw in an extra piece."" He gave me a fake smile and said, ""sorry, I can't do that."" LAME. Overall, it was just not outstanding service, which didn't jive with how inviting and warm the food made us feel.  On our way out, I also literally ran into our server, and we did one of those dances where we kept trying to get out of each other's way, but kept going the same way. I swear, I caught an eye roll, even as I apologized (no such apology from him).So Lilia, you may not care because your food is great and you've still got customers lined up a month out, but on the off chance you really want to make dining at your establishment a really over-the-top excellent experience, please please have a talk with your waitstaff.",4.0 star rating,"Manhattan, NY",5,0,-0.10000000149,12.3999996185,"bread service,friends,Pete Wells,food,review,service,stars,reviews,review,words,food,agnolotto,experience,star territory,First,computer screen,milk ricotta,sheep,feta,Calabrian Chili,Lilia,parcel,thing,res,Garlic,plate,service,nothing,Petey,starters,party,table,starters,gnocchi,agnolotto,service,pasta,server,dough,mouth,shiz,office,girls night out,weeknight,mac,cheese,citizen,service,Breadcrumbs,pastas,malfaldini,agnolotti,malfaldini,Cacio e Pepe Fritelle,broth,Everyone,dances,olive oil cake,girls,something,thing,malfaldini,friend,disservice,good,donuts,Lemon,Mint,Parmigiano,portion,guys,end,order,order,food,chocolate torte,dessert,reservation,expression,disdain,Williamsburg.,food,kitchen,server,itGrilled Clams,deliciousWhole Artichoke,joke,piece,dishes,smile,one,each other,decision.So,notHousemade Mozarella,Bottarga,way,way,way,orders,server,waitstaff,chance,customers,apology,eye roll,establishment,talk,order,order,experience,dining,fritelle,table,kitchen,mains,whyyyyyy,industry,elsewhere,deal,someone","7,1,1,7,5,7,1,5,5,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,1,1,3,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,1,7,7,1,7,7,2,1,7,7,7,7,2,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,6,4,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,2,7,7,7,2,7,1","0.0738077685237,0.0615059956908,0.0546691678464,0.0425140336156,0.0343441516161,0.0304788630456,0.0302531179041,0.025515248999,0.0253849495202,0.0201426018029,0.0200977288187,0.0186238121241,0.0171404797584,0.0150005389005,0.0149237802252,0.0148695567623,0.0148276332766,0.0148276332766,0.0148276332766,0.0142725724727,0.0136876171455,0.0127384681255,0.0124394744635,0.0121610276401,0.0115764243528,0.0115013262257,0.0113839367405,0.0110340751708,0.0100674908608,0.00954932905734,0.00877667311579,0.00830337684602,0.0076129375957,0.00710011320189,0.00709918513894,0.00693059666082,0.00643368344754,0.00593987293541,0.00566264241934,0.00566264241934,0.0056385435164,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00562900817022,0.00540612637997,0.00513954972848,0.00497893150896,0.00475587230176,0.00475062895566,0.00475062895566,0.0046655908227,0.00453097280115,0.00452492479235,0.00450625736266,0.00444137537852,0.00434310687706,0.00434310687706,0.00434310687706,0.004334917292,0.00432083802298,0.00427561951801,0.00421850895509,0.00404840521514,0.00379971391521,0.00379971391521,0.00379971391521,0.00377639429644,0.00376954837702,0.00376954837702,0.00367580167949,0.00367404310964,0.00363485375419,0.00344655569643,0.00344655569643,0.00344390701503,0.0034390531946,0.0034390531946,0.00333235110156,0.00292757060379,0.0029248308856,0.00290221930481,0.00289846840315,0.00275510083884,0.00255757570267,0.00255757570267,0.00255757570267,0.00255639618263,0.00253901700489,0.00239086453803,0.0023753689602,0.00224909395911,0.00224909395911,0.00222124857828,0.00222124857828,0.00222124857828,0.00208054250106,0.00184434233233,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00176663242746,0.00161722442135,0.00161435978953,0.00156690482982,0.0013707682956,0.00128444028087,0.00128444028087,0.00128374702763,0.00112564757001,0.00112495105714,0.00112428737339,0.00112304696813,0.00112246559002,0.000935877556913"

Lilia,5543,567 Union Ave,Brooklyn,11211.0,56148,"This restaurant exceeded our expectations since it's brand new. The service was well organized and I can say that they went above and beyond to accommodate us even when we ordered bread which they don't offer it on the menu, as we found out after the fact. It's also very pretty and although bigger than your average Williamsburg restaurant, it manages to look both cozy and romantic. I'm taking a star away for one reason:Portion size.  My boyfriend ordered gnocchi with fresh pesto. It was absolutely divine, but the portion was appetizer size and that left my bf pushing the food around awkwardly so he won't  finish it in 2 seconds flat. It also left him hungry. My tuna steak was a good size, except the side dish that accompanied  it was also ridiculously small. Half a sun-choke and few more, I forget what, but equally small stuff, come on!Mid-dinner we asked for bread and no matter how long we tried to wait, we finished both our dinners, before the bread actually came out. We go out a lot and I can say we both understand the artsy side of food, but there is no reason to make a pasta dish as small. It's dinner!

I'll start with the positives: the restaurant is gorgeous with a lovely ambiance and simple, classy decor. They sat us without a reservation despite being fully booked, which was very accommodating. Unfortunately, the service and food were lacking. Our server was very quiet with no personality or smile and she offered us still or sparkling, no tap. It starts the experience off on the wrong foot to not offer tap water. This isn't Per Se or le Bernadin, it's Union avenue next to a car repair shop. I wish I could say the food was delicious but the prosciutto came with a bizarre intensely-flavored mustard dip that clashed with the taste of the prosciutto. The Parmesan butter that accompanied was quite good though. Our entrees were not impressive. The grilled tuna was a very small piece that was way too chewy and the grilled lamb was just a huge piece of gristle, although the fennel salad garnish was tasty.Maybe it's just growing pains and they will improve with time.
